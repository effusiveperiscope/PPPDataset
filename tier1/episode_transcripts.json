[{"season": "1", "eps": [{"full_transcript": "\nNarrator: Once upon a time, in the magical land of Equestria, there were two regal sisters who ruled together and created harmony for all the land. To do this, the eldest used her unicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. Thus, the two sisters maintained balance for their kingdom and their subjects, all the different types of ponies. But as time went on, the younger sister became resentful. The ponies relished and played in the day her elder sister brought forth, but shunned and slept through her beautiful night. One fateful day, the younger unicorn refused to lower the moon to make way for the dawn. The elder sister tried to reason with her, but the bitterness in the young one's heart had transformed her into a wicked mare of darkness: Nightmare Moon.\n[lightning crack]\nNarrator: She vowed that she would shroud the land in eternal night. Reluctantly, the elder sister harnessed the most powerful magic known to ponydom: the Elements of Harmony. Using the magic of the Elements of Harmony, she defeated her younger sister, and banished her permanently in the moon. The elder sister took on responsibility for both...\nNarrator and Twilight Sparkle: ...sun and moon...\nTwilight Sparkle: ...and harmony has been maintained in Equestria for generations since. Hmm... Elements of Harmony. I know I've heard of those before... but where?\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwinkleshine: There you are, Twilight! Moon Dancer is having a little get-together in the west castle courtyard. You wanna come?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, sorry, girls... I've got a lot of studying to catch up on.\nTwinkleshine: [sigh] Does that pony do anything except study? I think she's more interested in books than friends.\nTwilight Sparkle: I know I've heard of the Elements of Harmony.\n\nSpike: Ow!\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike! Spi-ike! Spike?\nSpike: [groan]\nTwilight Sparkle: There you are. Quick, find me that old copy of Predictions and Prophecies. What's that for?\nSpike: Well, it was a gift for Moon Dancer, but...\n[squeak]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing.\nSpike: But we're on a break!\nTwilight Sparkle: No, no, no... no, no, no! [grunts] Spike!\nSpike: It's over here!\n[whack]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ah! Elements, Elements, E, E, E... Aha! Elements of Harmony, see: Mare in the Moon?\nSpike: Mare in the Moon? But that's just an old ponies' tale.\nTwilight Sparkle: Mare, mare... aha! The Mare in the Moon, myth from olden pony times. A powerful pony who wanted to rule Equestria, defeated by the Elements of Harmony and imprisoned in the moon. Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about nighttime eternal! [gasp] Spike! Do you know what this means?\nSpike: No\u2014 whoa!\n[smack]\nSpike: Ow!\nTwilight Sparkle: Take a note please, to the Princess.\nSpike: Okie dokie.\nTwilight Sparkle: My dearest teacher, my continuing studies of pony magic have led me to discover that we are on the precipice of disaster!\nSpike: Hold on. Preci... preci...\nTwilight Sparkle: Threshold.\nSpike: Threh...\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, brink? Ugh, that something really bad is about to happen! For you see, the mythical Mare in the Moon is in fact Nightmare Moon, and she's about to return to Equestria, and bring with her eternal night! Something must be done to make sure this terrible prophecy does not come true. I await your quick response. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.\nSpike: Twi... light Spar... kle. Got it!\nTwilight Sparkle: Great! Send it.\nSpike: Now?\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course!\nSpike: Uh, I dunno, Twilight, Princess Celestia's a little busy getting ready for the Summer Sun Celebration. And it's like, the day after tomorrow.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's just it, Spike. The day after tomorrow is the thousandth year of the Summer Sun Celebration! It's imperative that the Princess is told right away!\nSpike: Impera... impera...\nTwilight Sparkle: Important!\nSpike: Whoa!\n[crunch]\nSpike: Okay, okay! [inhale] There, it's on its way. But I wouldn't hold your breath...\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, I'm not worried, Spike. The Princess trusts me completely. In all the years she's been my mentor she's never once doubted me.\nSpike: [belch]\nTwilight Sparkle: See? I knew she would want to take immediate action.\nSpike: [clears throat] My dearest, most faithful student Twilight. You know that I value your diligence and that I trust you completely.\nTwilight Sparkle: Mm-hm!\nSpike: ...but you simply must stop reading those dusty old books!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp]\n\nSpike: My dear Twilight, there is more to a young pony's life than studying, so I'm sending you to supervise the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration in this year's location: Ponyville. And, I have an even more essential task for you to complete: make some friends!\nTwilight Sparkle: [groan]\nSpike: Look on the bright side, Twilight. The Princess arranged for you to stay in a library. Doesn't that make you happy?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, yes it does. You know why? Because I'm right! I'll check on the preparations as fast as I can, then get to the library to find some proof of Nightmare Moon's return.\nSpike: Then... when will you make friends, like the Princess said?\nTwilight Sparkle: She said to check on preparations. I am her student, and I'll do my royal duty, but the fate of Equestria does not rest on me making friends.\nRoyal guards: [whinnying]\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you, sirs.\nRoyal guards: [huffing]\nSpike: Maybe the ponies in Ponyville have interesting things to talk about. Come on, Twilight, just try!\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh... hello?\nPinkie Pie: [prolonged gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, that was interesting all right.\nSpike: [sigh]\n\nSpike: Summer Sun Celebration official overseer's checklist. Number one, banquet preparations: Sweet Apple Acres.\nApplejack: Yeehaw!\n[thump]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sigh] Let's get this over with... Good afternoon. My name is Twilight Sparkle\u2014\nApplejack: Well, howdy-doo, Miss Twilight, a pleasure makin' your acquaintance. I'm Applejack. We here at Sweet Apple Acres sure do like makin' new friends!\nTwilight Sparkle: Friends? Actually, I\u2014\nApplejack: So, what can I do you for?\nSpike: [snickering]\nTwilight Sparkle: [clears throat] Well, I am in fact here to supervise preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration. And you're in charge of the food?\nApplejack: We sure as sugar are! Would you care to sample some?\nTwilight Sparkle: As long as it doesn't take too long...\n[triangle ringing]\nApplejack: Soup's on, everypony!\n[thump]\nApplejack: Now, why don't I introduce y'all to the Apple family?\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks, but I really need to hurry\u2014\nApplejack: This here's Apple Fritter. Apple Bumpkin. Red Gala. Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Caramel Apple, Apple Strudel, Apple Tart, Baked Apples, Apple Brioche, Apple Cinnamon Crisp... [deep breath] Big McIntosh, Apple Bloom and Granny Smith. Up'n'attem, Granny Smith, we got guests.\nGranny Smith: [snort] Wha..? Soup's on? I'm up, here I come, ahm comin'...\nApplejack: Why, I'd say you're already part of the family!\nTwilight Sparkle: [spit] [nervous laughter] Okay, well, I can see the food situation is handled, so we'll be on our way.\nApple Bloom: Aren't you gonna stay for brunch?\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry, but we have an awful lot to do...\nApple family: [disappointed sighs]\nTwilight Sparkle: ...fine.\nApple family: [cheering]\n\nSpike: Food's all taken care of, next is weather.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh... I ate too much pie...\nSpike: Hmm, there's supposed to be a Pegasus pony named Rainbow Dash clearing the clouds.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, she's not doing a very good job, is she?\n[whack]\n[splat]\nTwilight Sparkle: Nng.\nRainbow Dash: [sheepish laughter] Uh, 'scuse me? [more sheepish laughter]\nTwilight Sparkle: Nnnn.\nRainbow Dash: [laughter] Lemme help you.\n[rushing water]\nRainbow Dash: [more sheepish laughter] Oops, I guess I overdid it. Um, uh, how about this? My very own patented Rain-Blow Dry! No no. Don't thank me. You're quite welcome. [bursts out laughing]\nSpike: [bursts out laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Let me guess. You're Rainbow Dash.\nRainbow Dash: The one and only. Why, you heard of me?\nTwilight Sparkle: I heard you were supposed to be keeping the sky clear. [sigh] I'm Twilight Sparkle, and the Princess sent me to check on the weather.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, yeah, that'll be a snap. I'll do it in a jiffy. Just as soon as I'm done practicing.\nTwilight Sparkle: Practicing for what?\nRainbow Dash: The Wonderbolts! They're gonna perform at the Celebration tomorrow, and I'm gonna show 'em my stuff!\nTwilight Sparkle: The Wonderbolts?\nRainbow Dash: Yep!\nTwilight Sparkle: The most talented flyers in all of Equestria?\nRainbow Dash: That's them!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pfft! Please. They'd never accept a Pegasus who can't even keep the sky clear for one measly day.\nRainbow Dash: Hey, I could clear this sky in ten seconds flat.\nTwilight Sparkle: Prove it.\n[whooshing noises]\nRainbow Dash: [sounds of exertion] Loop-de-loop around, and wham! What'd I say? Ten. Seconds. Flat. I'd never leave Ponyville hanging. [sheep baaing] [chuckles] You should see the look on your face. Ha! You're a laugh, Twilight Sparkle. I can't wait to hang out some more.\nSpike: Wow, she's amazing! [laughs]\nTwilight Sparkle: Rrgh.\nSpike: Wait! It's kinda pretty once you get used to it!\n\nSpike: Decorations. Beautiful...\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, the d\u00e9cor is coming along nicely. This ought'a be quick. I'll be at the library in no time. Beautiful indeed.\nSpike: Not the d\u00e9cor, her!\nRarity: No, no, no, oh! Goodness no.\nSpike: How are my spines? Are they straight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Good afternoon\u2014\nRarity: Just a moment, please! I'm 'in the zone', as it were. Oh, yes! Sparkle always does the trick, does it not? Why, Rarity, you are a talent. Now, um, how can I help yo\u2014 [yelp] Oh my stars, darling! Whatever happened to your coiffure?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, you mean my mane? Well, it's a long story. I'm just here to check on the decorations, and then I'll be out of your hair!\nRarity: Out of my hair? What about your hair?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait! Where are we going?! Help!\n\nRarity: No, no, uh-uh. Too green. Too yellow. Too poofy. Not poofy enough. Too frilly. Too... shiny. Now go on, my dear. You were telling me where you're from.\nTwilight Sparkle: [wincing] I've... been sent... from Canterlot... to\u2014\nRarity: Huh?\n[crash]\nRarity: Canterlot?! Oh, I am so envious! The glamour, the sophistication! I have always dreamed of living there! I can't wait to hear all about it! We are gonna be the best of friends, you and I... Emeralds?! What was I thinking? Let me get you some rubies!\nTwilight Sparkle: Quick! Before she decides to dye my coat a new color!\nSpike: [sigh]\n\nSpike: Wasn't she wonderful?\nTwilight Sparkle: Focus, Casanova. What's next on the list?\nSpike: [clears throat] Oh, uh, music! It's the last one!\n[distant birdsong fanfare]\nFluttershy: Oh my. Um, stop please, everyone, umm. Excuse me, sir? I mean no offense, but your rhythm is just a teeny-tiny bit off. Now, follow me, please. A-one, a-two, a-one two three-\nTwilight Sparkle: Hello!\nFluttershy: [yelp]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh my, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to frighten your birds. I'm just here to check up on the music and it's sounding beautiful. [pause] I'm Twilight Sparkle. [pause] What's your name?\nFluttershy: [very quietly] Um... I'm Fluttershy.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sorry, what was that?\nFluttershy: [even quieter] Um... My name is Fluttershy.\nTwilight Sparkle: Didn't quite catch that.\nFluttershy: [squeaking]\nTwilight Sparkle: [pause] Well, um, it looks like your birds are back, so I guess everything's in order. Keep up the good work!\nFluttershy: [squeaking]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oookay. [to Spike] Well, that was easy.\nFluttershy: [gasp] A baby dragon!\n[thump]\nFluttershy: Oh, I've never seen a baby dragon before. He's sooo cute!\nSpike: Well, well, well...!\nFluttershy: Oh my, he talks. I didn't know dragons could talk. That's just so incredibly wonderful I, I just don't even know what to say!\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, in that case we'd better be going.\nFluttershy: Wait, wait! What's his name?\nSpike: I'm Spike.\nFluttershy: Hi Spike, I'm Fluttershy. Wow, a talking dragon! And what do dragons talk about?\nSpike: Well, what do you wanna know?\nFluttershy: Absolutely everything.\nTwilight Sparkle: [groan]\nSpike: Well... I started out as a cute little purple and green egg...\n\nSpike: ...and that's the story of my whole entire life! Well, up until today. Do you wanna hear about today?\nFluttershy: Oh, yes, please!\nSpike: Gyah!\nTwilight Sparkle: I am so sorry, how did we get here so fast? This is where I'm staying while in Ponyville and my poor baby dragon needs his sleep.\nSpike: No I don't\u2014 whoa!\nTwilight Sparkle: Aww, wook at dat, he's so sweepy he can't even keep his widdle bawance!\nFluttershy: Poor thing, you simply must get into bed...\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, yes, we'll get right on that. Well, g'night!\n[door slamming]\nSpike: Huh. Rude much?\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry, Spike, but I have to convince the Princess that Nightmare Moon is coming, and we're running out of time! I just need to be alone so I can study without a bunch of crazy ponies trying to make friends all the time. Now, where's the light?\n[light flicks on]\nTwilight Sparkle and Spike: [honk]\nPonies: Surprise!\n[kazoo blows]\nTwilight Sparkle: [groan]\n[music warps down]\n\nPinkie Pie: Surprise!\n[party whistle blows]\nPinkie Pie: Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie, and I threw this party just for you! Were you surprised? Were ya? Were ya? Huh huh huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: Very surprised. Libraries are supposed to be quiet.\nPinkie Pie: Well, that's silly! What kind of welcome party would this be if it were quiet? I mean, duh, bo-ring! Y'see, I saw you when you first got here, remember? You were all \"hello\" and I was all [deep gasp], remember? Y'see I've never saw you before and if I've never saw you before that means you're new, 'cause I know everypony, and I mean everypony in Ponyville!\nTwilight Sparkle: [groan]\nPinkie Pie: And if you're new, that meant you haven't met anyone yet, and if you haven't met anyone yet, you must not have any friends, and if you don't have any friends then you must be lonely, and that made me so sad, then I had an idea, and that's why I went [deep gasp]! I must throw a great big ginormous super-duper spectacular welcome party and invite everyone in Ponyville! See? And now you have lots and lots of friends!\n[kettle whistling]\nApplejack: Are you all right, sugarcube?\n[train whistle blowing]\nPinkie Pie: Aww, she's so happy she's crying!\nSpike: \"Hot sauce\".\nPinkie Pie: Ooh...

Pinkie Pie's starting \"pin the tail on the pony\"! Wanna play?\nTwilight Sparkle: No! All the ponies in this town are crazy! Do you know what time it is?!\nSpike: It's the eve of the Summer Sun Celebration. Everypony has to stay up, or they'll miss the Princess raise the sun! You really should lighten up, Twilight. It's a party!\nTwilight Sparkle: [mockingly imitates Spike]\n[door closes, music stops]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh, here I thought I'd have time to learn about the Elements of Harmony but, silly me, all this ridiculous friend-making has kept me from it! \"Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about everlasting night.\" I hope the Princess was right... I hope it really is just an old pony tale...\nSpike: C'mon, Twilight, it's time to watch the sunrise!\n\nPinkie Pie: Isn't this exciting? Are you excited, 'cause I'm excited, I've never been so excited\u2014 well, except for the time that I saw you walking into town and I went [deep gasp] but I mean really, who can top that?\n[fanfare]\nMayor Mare: Fillies and gentlecolts, as mayor of Ponyville, it is my great pleasure to announce the beginning of the Summer Sun Celebration!\n[ponies cheering]\nMayor Mare: In just a few moments, our town will witness the magic of the sunrise, and celebrate this, the longest day of the year! And now, it is my great honor to introduce to you the ruler of our land, the very pony who gives us the sun and the moon each and every day, the good, the wise, the bringer of harmony to all of Equestria...\nFluttershy: Ready?\nMayor Mare: ...Princess Celestia!\nRarity: Huh?\n[ponies chattering quietly and nervously in the background]\nTwilight Sparkle: This can't be good.\nMayor Mare: Remain calm, everypony, there must be a reasonable explanation!\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, ooh, I love guessing games! Is she hiding?\nRarity: She's gone!\n[ponies gasping]\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, she's good. [yelp]\n[ponies gasping]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh no...

It's been so long since I've seen your precious little sun-loving faces.\nRainbow Dash: What did you do with our Princess?!\nApplejack: [muffled] Whoa there, Nelly...\nNightmare Moon: [chuckle] Why, am I not royal enough for you? Don't you know who I am?\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, ooh, more guessing games! Um, Hokey Smokes! How about... Queen Meanie! No! Black Snooty, Black Snooty\u2014[muffled noises]\nNightmare Moon: Does my crown no longer count now that I have been imprisoned for a thousand years? Did you not recall the legend? Did you not see the signs?\nTwilight Sparkle: I did. And I know who you are. You're the Mare in the Moon \u2013 Nightmare Moon!\n[ponies gasping]\nNightmare Moon: Well well well, somepony who remembers me. Then you also know why I'm here.\nTwilight Sparkle: You're here to... to... [gulp]\nNightmare Moon: [chuckle] Remember this day, little ponies, for it was your last.

Whoa!\nApplejack: Simmer down, Sally. She ain't no spy. But she sure knows what's going on. Don't you, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: I read all about the prediction of Nightmare Moon. Some mysterious objects called the Elements of Harmony are the only things that can stop her, but I don't know what they are, where to find them; I don't even know what they do!\nPinkie Pie: \"The Elements of Harmony: A Reference Guide.\"\nTwilight Sparkle: How did you find that?!\nPinkie Pie: [sing-song voice] It was under \"E\"!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. There are six Elements of Harmony, but only five are known: Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Honesty and Loyalty. The sixth is a complete mystery.

Don't listen to them.\nShadowbolt Leader: Well?\nRainbow Dash: You... Thank you! For the offer, I mean, but I'm afraid I have to say no.\n[ponies cheering]\nRainbow Dash: See? I'd never leave my friends hangin'.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Whoa.\nApplejack: Come on, Twilight. Isn't this what you've been waitin' for?\nTwilight Sparkle: The Elements of Harmony, we've found them. Careful, careful!\nPinkie Pie: One, two, three, four... There's only five!\nRainbow Dash: Where's the sixth?\nTwilight Sparkle: The book said: when the five are present, a spark will cause the sixth Element to be revealed.\nApplejack: What in the hay is that supposed to mean?\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm not sure, but I have an idea. Stand back. I don't know what will happen.\nApplejack: Come on now, y'all. She needs to concentrate.\nTwilight Sparkle: Aah!\nEverypony: Twilight!\nTwilight Sparkle: The Elements!\n[All five ponies talking over each other: Fluttershy: Twilight? Applejack: What? Rarity: Where did she go? Pinkie Pie: What happened? Rainbow Dash: What's going on?]\n\nApplejack: Twilight, where are you?\nRarity: Look!\nApplejack: Come on!\nTwilight Sparkle: [coughs, gasps]\nNightmare Moon: [evil laugh]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp] Hmph!\nNightmare Moon: You're kidding. You're kidding, right?\nTwilight Sparkle: [groan] Just one spark. Come on, come on. Aah!\nNightmare Moon: No, no!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp] But... where's the sixth Element?!\nNightmare Moon: [laughter] You little foal! Thinking you could defeat me? Now you will never see your princess, or your sun! The night will last forever! [evil laugh]\n[All five ponies talking over each other: Pinkie Pie: Don't worry Twilight, we're here. Applejack: Don't worry, we'll be there.]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp] You think you can destroy The Elements of Harmony just like that? Well, you're wrong, because the spirits of The Elements of Harmony are right here.\nNightmare Moon: What?\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack, who reassured me when I was in doubt, represents the spirit of... honesty! Fluttershy, who tamed the manticore with her compassion, represents the spirit of... kindness! Pinkie Pie, who banished fear by giggling in the face of danger, represents the spirit of... laughter! Rarity, who calmed a sorrowful serpent with a meaningful gift represents the spirit of... generosity! And Rainbow Dash, who could not abandon her friends for her own heart's desire represents the spirit of... loyalty! The spirits of these five ponies got us through every challenge you threw at us.\nNightmare Moon: You still don't have the sixth Element! The spark didn't work!\nTwilight Sparkle: But it did! A different kind of spark. I felt it the very moment I realized how happy I was to hear you, to see you, how much I cared about you. The spark ignited inside me when I realized that you all... are my friends! You see, Nightmare Moon, when those Elements are ignited by the... the spark, that resides in the heart of us all, it creates the sixth element: the element of... magic!\nNightmare Moon: Nooo! Nooo!\n\nRainbow Dash: Ugh, my head.\nApplejack: Everypony okay?\nRarity: Oh, thank goodness.\nFluttershy: Why Rarity, it's so lovely.\nRarity: I know! I'll never part with it again.\nFluttershy: No. Your necklace. It looks just like your cutie mark.\nRarity: What? Ooh. So does yours.\nFluttershy: [gasp]\nPinkie Pie: Look at mine! Look at mine!\nRainbow Dash: Aw yeah.\nApplejack: Gee, Twilight! I thought you were just spoutin' a lot of hooey, but I reckon we really do represent the elements of friendship.\nPrincess Celestia: Indeed you do.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Princess Celestia.\nPrincess Celestia: Twilight Sparkle, my faithful student. I knew you could do it.\nTwilight Sparkle: But... you told me it was all an old pony tale.\nPrincess Celestia: I told you that you needed to make some friends, nothing more. I saw the signs of Nightmare Moon's return, and I knew it was you who had the magic inside to defeat her, but you could not unleash it until you let true friendship into your heart. Now if only another will as well. Princess Luna!\nPrincess Luna: [gasp]\nPrincess Celestia: It has been a thousand years since I have seen you like this. Time to put our differences behind us. We were meant to rule together, little sister.\nTwilight Sparkle and Rainbow Dash: Sister?\nPrincess Celestia: Will you accept my friendship?\nPinkie Pie: Whoa!\nPrincess Luna: I'm so sorry! I missed you so much, big sister!\nPrincess Celestia: I've missed you, too.\nPinkie Pie: [blows her nose] [sobs] Hey, you know what this calls for?\n\nPinkie Pie: A party!\n[music and cheering ponies]\nPrincess Celestia: Why so glum, my faithful student? Are you not happy that your quest is complete and you can return to your studies in Canterlot?\nTwilight Sparkle: That's just it. Just when I learned how wonderful it is to have friends, I have to leave them.\nPrincess Celestia: Spike, take a note, please. I, Princess Celestia, hereby decree that the unicorn Twilight Sparkle shall take on a new mission for Equestria. She must continue to study the magic of friendship. She must report to me her findings from her new home in Ponyville.\n[ponies cheer]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh thank you, Princess Celestia! I'll study harder than ever before.\n[ponies cheer]\n\nPinkie Pie: Isn't this exciting? Are you excited cause I'm excited I've never been so excited, well, except for the time that I went [deep gasp] but I mean really-\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nSpike: No. Nope. Nope... [continues in background]\nApplejack: Thank you kindly, Twilight, for helping me out. I bet Big McIntosh I could get all these Golden Delicious in the barn by lunchtime. If I win, he's gonna walk down Stirrup Street in one of Granny's girdles. [chuckles]\nTwilight Sparkle: No problem at all, Applejack. I'm glad the goal is lunchtime. All this hard work is making me hungry.\nSpike: I know, right?\nTwilight Sparkle: Puh-lease, Spike. You've been lounging on my back all morning while we worked.\nSpike: Exactly. You two are taking so long, I missed snack-time.\nTwilight Sparkle: [stomach grumbles] [laughs nervously] Eh, I guess we better get some food.\nSpike: Nope. Worm.

Her Grand Royal Highness, Princess Celestia of Equestria, is pleased to announce the Grand Galloping Gala to be held in the magnificent capital city of Canterlot, on the 21st day of, eh, yadda yadda yadda, cordially extends an invitation to Twilight Sparkle plus one guest.\nApplejack and Twilight Sparkle: [gasp] The Grand Galloping Gala!\n\n[theme song]\n\nApplejack and Twilight Sparkle: The Grand Galloping Gala! [cheering]\nSpike: [burp] Look, two tickets.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow, great! I've never been to the gala. Have you, Spike?\nSpike: No, and I plan to keep it that way. I don't want any of that girly frilly frou-frou nonsense.\nTwilight Sparkle: Aw, come on Spike. A dance would be nice.\nApplejack: Nice? It's a heap good more than just nice. I'd love to go. Land sakes...\n\nApplejack: If I had an apple stand set up, ponies would be chowin' our tasty vittles 'til the cows came home. Do you have any idea how much business I could drum up for Sweet Apple Acres? Why, with all that money, we could do a heap of fixin' up 'round here. We could replace that saggy old roof, and Big McIntosh could replace that saggy old plow, and Granny Smith could replace that saggy old hip.\n\nApplejack: Why, I'd give my left hind leg to go to that gala.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, well in that case, would you like to\u2014\nRainbow Dash: Whoa! [crash] Ugh. Are we talking about the Grand Galloping Gala?\nApplejack: Rainbow Dash. You told me you were too busy to help me harvest apples. What were you busy doing? Spyin'?\nRainbow Dash: No, I was busy napping, and I just happened to hear that you have an extra ticket?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah, but\u2014\nRainbow Dash: YES! This is so awesome. The Wonderbolts perform at the Grand Galloping Gala every year. I can see it now...\n\nRainbow Dash: Everyone would be watching the sky. Their eyes riveted on the Wonderbolts, but then in would fly Rainbow Dash!\n[audience gasps]\nRainbow Dash: I would draw their attention with my Super Speed Strut.\n[audience cheers]\nRainbow Dash: Then, I would mesmerize 'em with my Fantastic Filly Flash. And for my grand finale, the Buccaneer Blaze! The ponies would go wild!\n[audience cheers]\nRainbow Dash: The Wonderbolts would insist that my signature moves be incorporated into their routine, and then welcome me as their newest member.\n\nRainbow Dash: Don't you see, Twilight? This could be my one chance to show 'em my stuff. You gotta take me! [grunt]\nApplejack: Hold on just one pony pickin' minute here. [spit] I asked for that ticket first.\nRainbow Dash: So? That doesn't mean you own it.\nApplejack: Oh, yeah? Well I challenge you to a hoof-wrestle. Winner gets the ticket.\nApplejack and Rainbow Dash: [groan]\nTwilight Sparkle: Girls, these are my tickets, I'll decide who gets it, thank you very much. Whoever has the best reason to go should get the ticket, don't you think?\nApplejack: Drummin' up business for the farm?\nRainbow Dash: A chance to audition for the Wonderbolts?\nApplejack: Money t' fix Granny's hip.\nRainbow Dash: Living the dream.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh my, those were all pretty good reasons, aren't they? [stomach rumbles] [chuckles] Listen to that, I am starving. I don't know about you, but I can't make important decisions on an empty stomach, so I'll, uh, think about it over lunch and get back to you two, okay?\nApplejack and Rainbow Dash: Okay. [groan]\n\nSpike: So, who you gonna give the ticket to, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know Spike, but I really can't think straight when I'm hungry, so where should we eat?\n[crash]\nPinkie Pie: Gah! Bats! Bats on my face! Help! Wait, these aren't... tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala?!\n\nPinkie Pie: It's the most amazing incredible tremendous super-fun wonderful terrifically humongous party in all of Equestria! I've always always always wanted to go!\n\n[Pinkie Pie]\nOh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me\nOh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me\nHip hip\nHooray!\nIt's the best place for me\nFor Pinkie...\n\nOh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me\nOh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me\nHip hip\nHooray!\nIt's the best place for me\nFor Pinkie...\n\nPinkie Pie: With decorations like streamers and fairy-lights and pinwheels and pi\u00f1atas and pin-cushions. With goodies like sugar cubes and sugar canes and sundaes and sun-beams and sarsaparilla.

Twilight's taking me to the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot.\nRarity: The gala? I design ensembles for the gala every year, but I've never had the opportunity to attend. Oh, the society, the culture, the glamour! It's where I truly belong, and where I'm destined to meet him.\nPinkie Pie: Him! ... Who?\nRarity: Him.\n\nRarity: I would stroll through the gala, and everyone would wonder, \"Who is that mysterious mare?\" They would never guess that I was just a simple pony from little old Ponyville. Why, I would cause such a sensation that I would be invited for an audience with Princess Celestia herself, and the princess would be so taken with the style and elegance that she would introduce me to him, her nephew: the most handsome, eligible unicorn stallion in Canterlot. Our eyes would meet, our hearts would melt. Our courtship would be magnificent. He would ask for my hoof in marriage, and of course I would say, \"Yes!\" We would have a royal wedding, befitting a princess, which is [giggles] what I would become upon marrying him, the stallion of my dreams.\n\nRarity: Twilight, I simply cannot believe you would invite Pinkie Pie so she can... party, and prevent me from meeting my true love. How could you? Hmph.\nSpike: Hey!\nFluttershy: [gasp] Angel, these are perfect.\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, listen guys, I haven't decided who to give the extra ticket to.\nRarity and Pinkie Pie: You haven't?\nFluttershy: Um, excuse me, Twilight. I would just like to ask, I mean, if it would be all right, if you haven't given it to someone else...\nRarity: You? You want to go to the gala?\nFluttershy: Oh, no. I mean, yes, or, actually, kind of. You see...\n\nFluttershy: It's not so much the Grand Galloping Gala as it is the wondrous private gated garden that surrounds the dance. The flowers are said to be the most beautiful and fragrant in all of Equestria. For the night of the gala, and that night alone, would they all be in bloom... and that's just the flora! Don't get me started on the fauna. There's loons and toucans and bitterns, oh my! Hummingbirds that can really hum, and buzzards that can really buzz. White-blue jays, and red jays, and green jays, pink jays and pink flamingos!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Gee, Fluttershy, it sounds... beautiful...?\nRainbow Dash: Wait just a minute.\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash! Were you following me?\nRainbow Dash: No. I mean, yes. I mean, maybe. Look, it doesn't matter. I couldn't risk a goody-four-shoes like you giving that ticket away to just anybody.\nApplejack: Wait just another minute.\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack, were you following me too?\nApplejack: No. I was followin' this one to make sure she didn't try any funny business. Still trying to take mah ticket.\nRainbow Dash: Your ticket?\nPinkie Pie: But Twilight's taking me.\n[ponies argue]\n\n[ponies argue]\nTwilight Sparkle: QUIET!\nPinkie Pie: And then I said, \"Oatmeal, are you craz\u2014\" oh.\nTwilight Sparkle: Girls, there's no use in arguing.\nRarity: But Twilight\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: Eh! This is my decision, and I'm gonna make it on my own, and I certainly can't think straight with all this noise... [stomach rumbles] not to mention hunger. Now go on, shoo.\n[ponies grumble]\nTwilight Sparkle: And don't worry, I'll figure this out... somehow.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Spike, what am I gonna do? All five of my best friends have really good reasons to go to the gala. Applejack, or Rainbow Dash? Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy, Rarity... Oh, who should go with me? [stomach rumbles]\nSavoir Fare: Have you made your decision?\nTwilight Sparkle: I CAN'T DECIDE!\nSpike: Twilight, he just wants to take your order.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. I would love a daffodil and daisy sandwich.\nSpike: Do you have any rubies? No? Okay. I'll have the hay fries, extra crispy.\nTwilight Sparkle: What do you think, Spike?\nSpike: I think we have to try another restaurant. I mean, I like grass just fine, but would it hurt anybody to offer some gemstones?\nTwilight Sparkle: I mean about the Gala and the ticket and who I should take.\nSpike: Oh. You're still on that?\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, listen. How do I choose? And when I do choose, will the other four be mad at me? I mean, I could give up my ticket and give away two, but that would still leave three disappointed ponies. What if I\u2014\nSavoir Fare: Ah, your food.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh thank you. This looks so good. I'm sure everything will be much clearer once I eat.\n[ponies galloping]\nSavoir Fare: Em, madam? Are you going to eat your food in ze rain?\nTwilight Sparkle: It's not raining...\n[thunderclap]\nTwilight Sparkle: What's going on?\nRainbow Dash: Hi there, best friend forever I've ever ever had. Enjoying the sunny weather?\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash, what are you doing?\nRainbow Dash: Whaddya mean? I just saw the smartest, most generous pony about to get rained on, so I thought I'd kick a hole in the clouds to keep her dry so she could dine in peace, that's all.\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow, you're not trying to get extra consideration for the extra ticket by doing me extra special favors, are you?\nRainbow Dash: Me? No no no, of course not.\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh-huh.\nRainbow Dash: Seriously, I'd do it for anypony. [gulp] Heh heh, eh.\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow, I am not comfortable accepting unwanted favors, so I'd appreciate it if you close up that rain cloud right now.\nRainbow Dash: Ugh, fine. [zip]\nTwilight Sparkle: That's better. [groans]\nRarity: Twilight, it's raining.\nTwilight Sparkle: No, really?\nRarity: Come with me before you catch a cold!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [shaking] Heh heh, oops, sorry.\nRarity: Oh no, it's quite all right. After all, we are... the best of friends, are we not? And you know what the best of friends do?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh...\nRarity: Makeovers!\n[crashing, construction noises]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh, Rarity, ow, this really isn't fixing it. I mean, thank you but, ooh, that's too tight.\nRarity: There. Oh, you're simply darling.\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, yeah, it is kinda pretty, isn't it?\nRarity: And you. Oh Spike, I have a dandy little outfit for the dashing gent.\n[more crashing, construction noises]\nSpike: D-ah, ow, oh, hey, wow, watch it, whoa!\nTwilight Sparkle: [giggles] Oh, Spike.\nRarity: Now you just need a hat.\nSpike: Ugh, I told you, I don't want any part of this girly gala gunk. See you back at the library.\nRarity: [laughs] Oh, who needs him anyway. This is all about you, and how fabulous you'll look at the Grand Galloping Gala.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait, the Grand\u2014\nRarity: [gasp] And oh, my goodness, what a coincidence. I happen to have an ensemble of my own that matches yours to a T. We would be the belles of the ball, you and I. Everyone would be clamoring for our attention. All eyes would be on us, and then everyone would finally know, the most beautiful, most talented, most sophisticated pony in all of Equestria is Rarity the unicorn! Ah... [nervous laughter] and Twilight Sparkle, of course.\nTwilight Sparkle: I see what's going on. You're just buttering me up so I give you the extra ticket. Well it's not gonna work. You're going to have to wait for my decision just like everyone else. Now if you'll excuse me, I've been trying all day just to get some lunch!\nApplejack: Did somepony say lunch?\nTwilight Sparkle: You've got to be kidding me!\nApplejack: I got apple pie, apple fritters, apple tarts, apple dumplings, apple crisps, apple crumblers, and apple Brown Betty. Uh, the dessert, not my auntie. What do you say there, best friend?\nTwilight Sparkle: [stomach grumbles]\nApplejack: Is that a yes?\nTwilight Sparkle: No. No! I don't know who I'm giving the ticket to, and all these favors aren't making it any easier to decide. In fact, I'm less sure now than I was this morning. Ugh!\nApplejack: So, that's a maybe?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh, I never thought being showered with favors would be so aggravating.\nFluttershy: [humming]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp] Fluttershy, not you too?\nFluttershy: Oh, well, hello Twilight. I hope you don't mind, but we're all doing a little spring cleaning for you.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's summer.\nFluttershy: Oh, well, better late than never, right? It was Angel's idea.\nTwilight Sparkle: You're not doing this for the ticket, are you?\nFluttershy: Oh no, I'm doing this because you're my very best friend. Right, Angel? Oh, yes, we are just doing this for the ticket.\nTwilight Sparkle: No, no, no! Well, this was all very nice of you and Angel, but I'm not accepting any extra favors until I've made my final decision, so I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\nPonies: SURPRISE!\n[trumpets blow]\n\n[Pinkie Pie]\nTwilight is my bestest friend, whoopie, whoopie!\n\nTwilight is my bestest friend, whoopie, whoopie!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie...\n\n[Pinkie Pie]\nShe's the cutest, smartest, all around best pony, pony!\n\nShe's the cutest, smartest, all around best pony, pony!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie.\n\n[Pinkie Pie]\nI bet if I throw a super-duper fun party, party!\n\nI bet if I throw a super-duper fun party, party!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie!\n\n[Pinkie Pie]\nShe'll give her extra ticket to the Gala to me!\n\nShe'll give her extra ticket to the Gala to me!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: PIIINKIIIE!\nPinkie Pie: Yes, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: At least the other ponies tried to be subtle about the ticket.\nDrizzle: Wait, what ticket?

Where did she go? She's disappeared.]\n\nSpike: Ugh... Warn me next time you're gonna do that.\nTwilight Sparkle: I didn't even know it was gonna happen. Now quick, lock the doors!\n[doors closing, lights clicking]\nTwilight Sparkle: Phew. Yaaaargh! I can't decide, I just can't decide! It's important to all of you and I just can't stand to disappoint any of you, and giving me gifts and doing me favors won't make any difference, because you're all my friends and I wanna make you all happy and I can't, I just can't!\nApplejack: Twilight, sugar, I didn't mean to put so much pressure on you, and if it helps, I don't want the ticket anymore. You can give it to somepony else. I won't feel bad, I promise.\nFluttershy: Me too. I feel just awful that I made you feel so awful.\nPinkie Pie: And me too. It's no fun upsetting your friends.\nRarity: Twilight, it was unfair of me to try to force you as I did.\nRainbow Dash: Yes! That means the ticket is mine. Ha ha, [sing-song voice] I got the ticket, I got the ticket\u2014! You know, I haven't perfected my signature moves for the Wonderbolts anyway. I don't need that ticket either.\nApplejack: We all got so gung-ho about going to the gala that we couldn't see how un-gung-ho we were making you.\nRest of main cast: [in unison] We're sorry, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, take down a note. Dear Princess Celestia,\nI've learned that one of the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings, but when there's not enough blessings to go around, having more than your friends can make you feel pretty awful. So, though I appreciate the invitation, I will be returning both tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala.\nRest of main cast: [in unison] What?!\nTwilight Sparkle: If my friends can't all go, I don't wanna go either.\nApplejack: Twilight, you don't have to do that.\nTwilight Sparkle: Nope. I've made up my mind. Spike, you can send the letter now.\nSpike: [gasp]\nFluttershy: Now you won't get to go to the gala either.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's okay, girls. I couldn't possibly enjoy myself without my best friends there with me...\nRest of main cast: [laughing, \"awww\"]\nTwilight Sparkle: ...So I would rather not go at all.\nSpike: Hgh... hgh... urk... urk...\nApplejack: Well wallop my withers, Spike. Isn't that just like a boy? Can't handle the least bit of sentiment.\nSpike: [burp]\nApplejack: Whoa Nelly!\nTwilight Sparkle: A letter from the princess? That was fast.\nSpike: \"My faithful student Twilight,\nWhy didn't you just say so in the first place?\" Six tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala.\nRest of main cast: [gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: Now we can all go!\nRest of main cast: [cheer]\nTwilight Sparkle: [stomach rumbles] [laughs nervously]\nRarity: Allow us to treat you to dinner.\nRainbow Dash: What a great way to apologize.\nPinkie Pie: And to celebrate! Come on everyone, the cupcakes are on me!\nSpike: How come I don't get a ticket to the gala? Hurk! [burp] \"And one for you, Spike.\" [giggles] I mean, gross, I have to go too?

You need to rest up and get yourself better. I haven't met an apple orchard yet that I can't handle. Oops, sorry.

Now if I could just make a point without being inter--\nFluttershy: Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: --rupted.\nFluttershy: Twilight, I'm so sorry, but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also helping me this week with the official bunny census, where we count up all the new baby bunnies that were born this season. She's gonna help gather them using her wonderful herding skills.\nTwilight Sparkle: Anyone else? Anyone? No? Well then, as I was trying to say... Urgh! Never mind.\nMayor Mare: Ah-ahem. And so, with no further ado, it is my privilege to give the prize, Pony of Ponyville Award, to our beloved guest of honor, a pony of the utmost trustworthiness, reliability, and integrity. Ponyville's most capable and dependable friend: Applejack!\n[crowd cheer]\nSpike: Cool! Way to go Applejack, that was awesome! I mean-- heh.\nMayor Mare: Ah-ahem.\nSpike: Awkward.\nApplejack: I'm here. I'm here. [yawn] [sigh] Sorry I'm late--whoa--I was just... whoa... Did I get your tail? Miss Mayor. Thank you kindly for this here... award thingy. [yawn] It's so bright and shiny and, heh, heh heh, I sure do look funny heh. Ooo-ooo.\nPinkie Pie: Woo-ooo.\nApplejack: Ooo-ooo.\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay. Well, thank you Applejack for saving us from that scary stampede, and always being there for everypony.\nApplejack: [yawn] Yeah. I like helping the ponyfolks and [yawn] and stuff. [snore] Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, Thanks.\n[sounds of dragging metal]\nTwilight Sparkle: Was it just me, or did Applejack seem a little--\nRainbow Dash: Tired?\nFluttershy: Dizzy?\nRarity: Messy? Well, did you see her mane?\nPinkie Pie: She seemed fine to me. Woo! Woo!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmm.\n\nApplejack: [grunts] [sigh] Phew. [gasp] O-oah.\nTwilight Sparkle: What on Earth is that pony doing?\nApplejack: Whoops.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey Applejack!\nApplejack: [snore]\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack.\nApplejack: [snore]\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack. AppleJACK!\nApplejack: Oh, howdy, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: What is all this?\nApplejack: It's Applebuck season. Whoa.\nTwilight Sparkle: Applewhat season?\nApplejack: Neh, It's what the Apple family calls harvestin' time. We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell 'em.\nTwilight Sparkle: But why are you doing it all alone?\nApplejack: 'cause Big McIntosh hurt himself.\nTwilight Sparkle: What about all those relatives I've met when I first came to Ponyville? Can't they help?\nApplejack: [sigh] They were just here for the Apple family reunion. They actually live all over Equestria and are busy harvestin' their own orchards. So, uh, I'm on my own. Which means, I should really get back to work. Ahem... hint hint? Get back to work?\nTwilight Sparkle: Fine.\nApplejack: Could you step aside, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: I just did. Applejack, you don't look so good.\nApplejack: Eh, don't any of you three worry none, I'm just fine and dandy. Whoa.\nTwilight Sparkle: Do you... want some help?\nApplejack: Help? No way, no how.\nTwilight Sparkle: But there's no way you can do it all on your own.\nApplejack: Is that a challenge?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uhm... no?\nApplejack: Well, I'm gonna prove to you that I can do it! Now if you'll excuse me, I've got apples to buck.\n\nRainbow Dash: There you are.\nApplejack: [yawn] I'm a mite sorry, Rainbow. I was busy applebuckin' and I guess ah, I closed my eyes for a second and, when I woke up, I was late. Now, what's this new trick a' yours?\nRainbow Dash: See this contraption?\nApplejack: Uh... Yeah.\nRainbow Dash: Well, I'm gonna stand on one end, then you're gonna jump down from that platform, launching me into the air faster than I can take off on my own. Once I'm in the air, I'm gonna do some amazing flips and spins that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts.\nApplejack: Isn't that a mite dangerous?\nRainbow Dash: Pfft, Heh, not for a pony who can fly.\nApplejack: Well, all right-y then. Oh my.\nRainbow Dash: Ready? One... two... THREE!\nApplejack: [crash]\nRainbow Dash: Umm... maybe I wasn't clear. You're supposed to land on the other end.\nApplejack: Got it. [grunt] [grunt] [grunt]\nRainbow Dash: Applejack, what the hay is going on? I mean, I thought I was working with Ponyville's best athlete!\nApplejack: You are. I'm okay. Really. I-I have an idea. Watch this. [groan] Ta da! Oh... Maybe not. Okay, one more try. I'm sure to get it this time.\nRainbow Dash: Ugh!\nApplejack: Heh heh... Here I go!\nRainbow Dash: Wait, Applejaaaaack!\nApplejack: You're welcome!\n\nRainbow Dash: [grunt]\nTwilight Sparkle: Can I help you?\nRainbow Dash: I think somepony else needs your help.\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack?\nRainbow Dash: Yep.\n\nApplejack: Ow!\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack, can we talk? Applejack, can we talk?\nApplejack: Can bees squawk?! I don't think so.\nTwilight Sparkle: No. Can we talk?\nApplejack: Twenty stalks? Bean or celery?\nTwilight Sparkle: No! I need to talk to you.\nApplejack: You need to walk to the zoo? Well, who's stoppin' you?\nTwilight Sparkle: I need to talk to you!\nApplejack: Oh! Well why didn't you say so? What you wanna talk about?\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash dropped in to see me today.\nApplejack: That's quite neighborly of her.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, except that she crashed onto my balcony after you launched her into the air.\nApplejack: Oh, yeah. I wasn't feeling quite myself this morning.\nTwilight Sparkle: Because you're working too hard and you need help.\nApplejack: What? Kelp? I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed.\nTwilight Sparkle: HELP! You need HELP!\nApplejack: Nothin' doin', Twilight. I'm gonna prove to you, t'everypony, that I can do this on my own. Ow! Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go help Pinkie Pie.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh.\n\nMrs. Cake: Now Pinkie Pie, are you sure you're up for baking the muffins and running the store this afternoon?\nPinkie Pie: Yes siree bob, Mrs. Cake. Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help me out. Why, she's the best baker ever. Right, Applejack?\nMr. Cake: No? You're not the best baker ever?\nApplejack: WHAT? Oh no! I mean, don't you fret. I can bake anything from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye.\nMrs. Cake: [sigh] All right. Well, see you later, girls!\nPinkie Pie: Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'.\n\nPinkie Pie: All right-y! I'll get the sugar and the eggs. Can you get me some chocolate chips?\nApplejack: Eh, uh, whu, what was that?\nPinkie Pie: Chocolate chips.\nApplejack: Chips... got it. Tater chips, a little salty and dry, okie-dokie. What next?\nPinkie Pie: Baking soda.\nApplejack: Soda. Perfect. That'll get the tater chips nice and wet. Now what?\nPinkie Pie: A cup of flour.\nApplejack: A cup o' sour? Well, lemons are sure sour. One cup o' sour, comin' up. Anything else, Pinkie?\nPinkie Pie: One last thing. Wheat germ.\nApplejack: Wheat worms? Oh, that must be fancy talk for earthworms.\nPinkie Pie: Now that's gonna be delicious.\nApplejack: If you say so.\n\nPinkie Pie: Free muffin sample spectacular!\nPonies: [Mmm, muffins]\nApplejack: Yeah! Muffin spectacles! Get 'em while they're hot.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: We came as soon as we heard.\nNurse Redheart: Oh thank you, Twilight. We need all the help we can get.\n[ponies moaning]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh no! What happened?\nSpike: [sniff]\nNurse Redheart: It was a mishap with some of the baked goods.\nPinkie Pie: No, not baked goods, baked bads. [groans]\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack.\nSpike: [chomp] Want one?\n\nApplejack: [grunt] [snore] What? Huh? [grunt] [snore]\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack, we need to talk.\nApplejack: Wha, huh? Oh, it's you, Twilight. [yawn] I know what you're gonna say, but the answer is still no.\nTwilight Sparkle: Not to upset your applecart, but you need help.\nApplejack: Hardy har. [groan] And no I don't.\nTwilight Sparkle: Here, let me help.\nApplejack: Help? No thanks. [groan] A little more... [groan] Little... [grunt] There. I'll prove that this apple can handle these apples. Come on [grunt] apples [grunt] fall off [grunt].\nTwilight Sparkle: AJ, think you're beating a dead... tree.\nApplejack: I knew that.\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, Applejack, I had something else to talk to you about. I just came back from Ponyville Urgent Care and--\nApplejack: You know, I'm a little busy to get lectured right now, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: But if you'd just let me help--\nApplejack: Ugh. No, no, NO! How many times do I gotta say it? I don't need no help from nopony!\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh. That pony is stubborn as a mule.\n[mule braying]\nTwilight Sparkle: No offense.\nMule: None taken.\n\nFluttershy: Oh Applejack! Thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit roundup.\nApplejack: Ugh. Why are we doin' this?\nFluttershy: Well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born, so it's my job to get a count of all the new families.\nApplejack: Fine. Can we just get on with it?\nFluttershy: Certainly, but remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows. They're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently.\nApplejack: I do NOT need any direction on corrallin' critters. Right, Winona?\nWinona: [barks]\nFluttershy: Okay, little bunnies! I need you to all gather here in the middle.\nApplejack: That's right! Let's go, bunnies. In the center. Hop to it. Swell. Just swell. Put 'em up, Winona!\nWinona: [barks]\nFluttershy: Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're scaring them.\nApplejack: We know what we're doin'. Get along, little bunnies.\nWinona: [barks] [growls]\nFluttershy: Oh no.\n\nRainbow Dash: STAMPEDE!\nDaisy: [yelps] Stampede!\n[ponies scream]\n[rabbits running]\nLily Valley: [sigh]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [humming] [gasp]\nRose: The horror, the horror.\nLily Valley: It was awful.\nDaisy: A disaster. A horrible, horrible disaster.\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't get it.\nLily Valley: Our gardens, destroyed.\nRose: Every last flower, devoured.\nDaisy: By... by... THEM!\nFluttershy: Oh my. Oh... Please stop, little bunnies. Oh no! Please, let's go home. Oh my goodness.\nTwilight Sparkle: All right. Enough is enough.\n\nApplejack: Must [gasp] keep [gasp] buckin'... just [gasp] a few [gasp] more. Must finish harvestin'.\nTwilight Sparkle: All right, Applejack. Your applebucking hasn't just caused you problems, it's over-propelled Pegasus', practically poisoned plenty of ponies, and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies. I don't care what you say, you. Need. Help.\nApplejack: [grunts] Ha! No, I don't. Look, I did it. I harvested the entire Sweet Apple Acres without your help. How d'ya like them apples?\nBig McIntosh: Um, how do you like them apples?\nApplejack: [mumbling] Where'd all the apple...? [mumbling] [sighs]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack. Applejack.\nApplejack: Huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, good, you're okay. Now Applejack, I completely respect the Apple family ways. You're always there to help anypony in need, so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride aside and allow your friends to help you.\nApplejack: Okay, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: I am not taking \"no\" for an answer--what?\nApplejack: Yes, Twilight. Yes, please. I could really use your help.\nTwilight Sparkle: [chuckles] [sigh]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Dear Princess Celestia,\nMy friend Applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have, and she's always there to help anypony. The only trouble is, when she needs help, she finds it hard to accept it, so while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends, it's also about accepting what our friends have to offer.\n\nYour faithful student,\nTwilight Sparkle\n\nApplejack: How about y'all take a little break? I got some fine apple juice waitin' for ya! [sigh] Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help. I was acting a bit stubborn.\nTwilight Sparkle: A bit?\nApplejack: Okay. A mite stubborn, and I'm awful sorry. Now, I know the town gave me the Prized Pony award, but the real award is having you five as my friends.\nRainbow Dash: Phew! That applebucking sure made me hungry.\nSpike: And I've got the perfect treat.\nPinkie Pie: Eeew... Spike, I threw those all away. Where'd you get them?\nSpike: From the trash.\nPonies: [in unison] EW!\nSpike: Just a little nibble? Come on.\nPonies: Ew!

Yeah, that's right.\nRainbow Dash: Gilda's my best friend from my days at Junior Speedster flight camp. Hey, remember the chant?\nGilda: Sha, they made us recite it every morning, I'll never get that lame thing out of my head.\nRainbow Dash: Sooo...\nGilda: Ugh. Only for you, Dash.\n[Rainbow Dash and Gilda]\nJunior Speedsters are our lives,\nSky-bound soars and daring dives\nJunior Speedsters, it's our quest,\nTo someday be the very best!\nPinkie Pie: [laughs] Oh that was awesome, and it gave me a great idea for a prank.

Good thing Pinkie Pie's here to keep you honest, G.\nGilda: Okay... Dash, last one to that cloud up there is a gnarly dragon egg. Go!

Something about being as busy as a bee.\nPinkie Pie: Hmph!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: So Pinkie Pie, are you sure that this friend of Rainbow Dash is really so mean?\nPinkie Pie: Um, yeah. She keeps stealing Rainbow Dash away, she pops my balloons, and she told me to buzz off. I've never met a griffon this mean. Well, actually, I've never met a griffon at all, but I bet if I had, she wouldn't have been as mean and grumpy as Gilda.\nTwilight Sparkle: You know what I think, Pinkie Pie.\nPinkie Pie: Hmm?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, I think... you're jealous.\nPinkie Pie: Jealous?\nSpike: Green with envy. Well, in your case, pink with envy.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, yes. Jealous. Listen Pinkie, I don't want to upset you, but just because Rainbow Dash has another friend doesn't make Gilda a grump. I mean, perhaps it's you, Pinkie, who needs to improve her attitude.\nPinkie Pie: Improve my attitude? But I... d... b.. it's Gilda that... d... are you seri... [scream of frustration]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sigh]\n\nPinkie Pie: Maybe Twilight is right. Maybe Gilda isn't a big meanie grumpy mean-meanie-pants. Maybe I'm just a big jealous judgmental jealous-jealousy-pants. [sigh]\n\nPinkie Pie: [sips]\nRainbow Dash: [laughing] That was sweet. Ugh, I gotta take care of a few weather jobs around here.

It was kind of a funny prank, I guess.\nGilda: [chews]\nPinkie Pie: [gasp] I did misjudge her! She's not only a meanie mean-pants, she's also a thief! Nonononono, she might give it back. It's just a joke.\nFluttershy: All right little ones, this way, this way. Mama duck, you're free and clear.\nGilda: Hey.\nFluttershy: Please excuse me.\nGilda: I'm walkin' here.\nFluttershy: Oh, um, I'm sorry.

I...\nGilda: [inhales] [roars]\n[bleat]\nFluttershy: [sobs]\nGilda: Ugh, please, all these lame ponies are driving me buggy. I gotta bail.\nPinkie Pie: She's a grump, and a thief, and a bully! The meanest kind of mean meanie-pants there is! I can take it, but no one treats Fluttershy like that. No. One. This calls for extreme measures, Pinkie Pie style!\n\nPinkie Pie: Welcome, welcome. Welcome!\nApplejack: Who's this Gilda I've heard nothing about?\nRarity: I hear she's an old friend of Rainbow Dash. A griffon, so rare.\nTwilight Sparkle: You've met Gilda, right? What's she like?\nFluttershy: Oh, um, well, I'll tell you later, Twilight.\nPinkie Pie: Welcome. Welcome.\nFluttershy: Um, Pinkie Pie, about this party for Gilda. Umm... do you really think it's a good idea? I mean\u2014\nPinkie Pie: Don't worry your pretty little head about mean old Gilda. Your auntie Pinkie Pie's got it all taken care of.\nFluttershy: I'm a year older than you.\nPinkie Pie: Gilda! I'm so honored to throw you one of my signature Pinkie Pie parties, and I really, truly, sincerely, hope you feel welcome here amongst all us pony folk.\nGilda: [grunt]\nPinkie Pie: [laughs]\nRainbow Dash: [laughs] Oh Pinkie Pie, the old hoof-shake buzzer.

This wasn't supposed to be a surprise party.\nGilda: I mean, I've got my eye on you.\nPinkie Pie: And I got my eye on you. Everyone, I'd like you all to meet Gilda, a long-time, dear friend of Rainbow Dash. Let's honor her and welcome her to Ponyville.\n[ponies cheer]\nPinkie Pie: Please help yourself.\nGilda: Vanilla lemon drops. Don't mind if I do.

She is the guest of honor after all.\nSpike: [grunt]\nGilda: Exactly. [gasp] [blow] [gasp] [blow]\n[laughter]\nGilda: [continued gasping and blowing]\nSpike: [laughs] Re-lighting birthday candles, I love that prank!

It's great, try some.\nRainbow Dash: Hey G, you're not upset about some silly candles, are you?\nGilda: No way, Dash. Like I said, I'm down with a good prank.\nRainbow Dash: Come on then, let's have some cake.\nGilda: Hey, I'm watching you. Like a hawk.\nPinkie Pie: Why? Can't you watch me like a griffon?\nApplejack: Hey y'all, it's pin the tail on the pony! Let's play!\nRarity: Oh, my favorite game! Can I go first? Can I have the purple tail?\nGilda: Well, I am the guest of honor, and I'll have the purple tail.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah, Gilda should definitely go first. Let's get you blindfolded.\nGilda: Hey what\u2014 ugh\u2014 what are you doing? Rrrah!\nPinkie Pie: We're spinning you around and around and then you can pin the tail on the pony. Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail.\nGilda: [mockingly] Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail. Hmph, yeah, right. This is another prank, isn't it? I'm going this way.\nPinkie Pie: Wait. The poster is this\u2014\nGilda: Whoa whaa waah waah waaaaah! [grunt]\n[crash]\nPinkie Pie: Uh, Gilda? You pinned the tail on the wrong end.\n[ponies laugh]\nGilda: [roar] This is your idea of a good time? I've never met a lamer bunch of dweebs in all my life! And Pinkie Pie, you! You are queen lame-o with your weak little party pranks! Did you really think you could make me lose my cool? Well, Dash and I have ten times as much cool as the rest of you put together! Come on Dash, we're bailing on this pathetic scene. Come on, Rainbow Dash. I said, we're leaving.\nRainbow Dash: You know Gilda, I was the one who set up all those weak pranks at this party.\nGilda: [gasp] What?\nPinkie Pie: Ooh.\nRainbow Dash: So I guess I'm queen lame-o.\nGilda: Come on, Dash, you're joshing me.\nRainbow Dash: They weren't all meant for you specifically, it was just dumb luck that you set them all off.\nPinkie Pie: I shoulda known, that dribble cup had Rainbow Dash written all over it.\nGilda: No way, i-it was Pinkie Pie! She set up this party to trip me up, to make a fool of me.\nPinkie Pie: Me? I threw this party to improve your attitude. I thought a good party might turn that frown upside down.\nRainbow Dash: And you sure didn't need any help making a fool of yourself. You know, this is not how I thought my old friends would treat my new friends. If being cool is all you care about, maybe you should go find some new cool friends someplace else.\nGilda: Rrgh... yeah? Well you, you... you are such a, a flip-flop, cool one minute and lame the next. When you decide not to be lame anymore, gimme a call.\n[door closes]\n[hawk shriek]\nRainbow Dash: Not cool.\nSpike: Wow, talk about a party pooper.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow, what was that about?\n[ponies talking indistinctly]\nMerry May: Um, what just happened?\nPony: Really awkward.\nRainbow Dash: I'm sorry everypony, for bringing Gilda here. I didn't know how rude she was. And Pinkie Pie, I'm really sorry she ruined that awesome party you put on for her.\nPinkie Pie: Hey, if you want to hang out with party poopers, that's your business.\nRainbow Dash: I'd rather hang out with you. No hard feelings?\nPinkie Pie: No hard feelings.\n[laughter]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey Pinkie. Sorry I accused you of misjudging Gilda. Looks like I'm the one who misjudged you.\nPinkie Pie: It's okay Twilight, even you can't be a super smart smarty smart-pants all the time. Come on everypony, there's still a whole lotta party to finish.\n[ponies cheer]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Dearest Princess Celestia,\nToday I learned that it's hard to accept when somepony you like wants to spend time with somepony who's not so nice. Though it's impossible to control who your friends hang out with, it is possible to control your own behavior. Just continue to be a good friend. In the end, the difference between a false friend and one who's true will surely come to light.\n\nYour faithful student,\nTwilight Sparkle\n\nPrincess Celestia: Dear Twilight Sparkle,\nMy most faithful student...

Ya did it! Growing magic, that's number twenty-five. Twenty-five different types of tricks and counting. And I think this is the best trick so far. Hello, Rarity. What's that? Aw, it's nothin', just my awesome mustache. [laughter]\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry, Romeo. As attractive and enticing as you look, it's just for practice, and it's gotta go.\nSpike: Wait! Aw, rats!\nTwilight Sparkle: [laughter]\n\n[theme song]\n\nSpike: Twenty-five, Twilight. Twenty-five different kinds of tricks and counting. I thought unicorns were only supposed to have a little magic that matches their special talents!\nTwilight Sparkle: True, for ponies whose talents are for things like cooking or singing or math. But what if a unicorn's special talent is magic?\nSpike: Like you, Twilight, and you know a ton of magic.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Spike, stop. I'm sure there are lots of ponies right here in Ponyville that know just as much magic as me.\nSpike: Are you kiddin'? I don't think there's another unicorn in all of Equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight.\nSnails: Gangway! Comin' through!\nSpike: Augh! Snips, Snails! What's goin' on?\nSnails: Wha, haven't you heard?\nSpike: Whoa!\nSnails: There's a new unicorn in town!\nSnips: Yeah! They say that she's got more magical powers than any other unicorn ever!\nTwilight Sparkle: Really?\nSpike: Aw, no way, that honor goes to Twilight here.\nTwilight Sparkle: Where is this unicorn?\nSnails: Ho, she's in the town square. Come on!\nSnips: Yeah! [laughter] Come on! Whooo!\n\nTrixie: Come one, come all! Come and witness the amazing magic of the Great and Powerful Trixie!\nAudience: Ooh!\nTrixie: Watch in awe as the Great and Powerful Trixie performs the most spectacular feats of magic ever witnessed by pony eyes!\n[fireworks and fanfare]\nRarity: My, my, my! What boasting!\nSpike: Come on, nopony's as magical as Twi\u2014 Twi\u2014 Twi\u2014 Oh!

Heh... Uh, I mean, yeah, uh, magic shmagic. Boo!\nTrixie: Well, well, well, it seems we have some neighsayers in the audience. Who is so ignorant as to challenge the magical ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie? Do they not know that they're in the presence of the most magical unicorn in all of Equestria?\nRarity: [raspberry] Just who does she think she is?\nSpike: Yeah! Since we all know that Twilight here is\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike! Shhh!\nSpike: What? What's wrong?\nTwilight Sparkle: You see the way they reacted to Trixie? I don't want anyone thinking I'm a show-off.\n[fanfare]\nRainbow Dash: So, \"Great and Powerful Trixie\". What makes you think you're so awesome, anyway?\nTrixie: Heh, why, only the Great and Powerful Trixie has magic strong enough to vanquish the dreaded ursa major!\n[fanfare, fireworks]\nAudience: Ahh!\nSnips: What?\nSnails: No way!\nTrixie: When all hope was lost, the ponies of Hoofington had no one to turn to. But the Great and Powerful Trixie stepped in and, with her awesome magic, vanquished the ursa major and sent it back to its cave deep within the Everfree Forest!\nSnips and Snails: Saw, sweet!\nSnips: That settles it.\nSnails: Trixie truly is the most talented, the most magical, the most awesome unicorn in Ponyville.\nSnips: No, in all of Equestria!\nSpike: How do you know? You didn't see it! And besides, Twi\u2014 [zip] Mmph! M-mmph!\nTrixie: [laughter] It's true, my enthusiastic little admirers. Trixie is most certainly the best in Ponyville.\n[crickets]\nTrixie: Don't believe the Great and Powerful Trixie? [chuckles] Well then, I hereby challenge you, Ponyvillians. Anything you can do, I can do better. Any takers? Anyone? Hmm? Or is Trixie destined to be the greatest equine who has ever lived?!\n[fireworks and fanfare]\nSpike: [zip] Please! She's unbearable! Ya gotta show her! Ya just gotta! [cries]\nTwilight Sparkle: There's no way I'm going to use my magic now, Spike. Especially since\u2014\nTrixie: Hmm, how about you?\nTwilight Sparkle: [gulps]\n[music]\n\nTrixie: Well, how about it? Hm? Is there anything you can do that the Great and Powerful Trixie can't?\nTwilight Sparkle: I\u2014 I\u2014\nTrixie: Well, little hayseed?\nApplejack: That's it! I can't stand for no more of this!\nSpike: You show her, AJ!\nApplejack: Can your magical powers do this?\n[banjo music]\nAudience: Whooo! [cheers]\nApplejack: Top that, missy.\nTrixie: Oh ye of little talent. Watch and be amazed at the magic of Trixie!\n[snake charmer music]\nApplejack: Whoa! Uh!\nAudience: [laughter and cheers]\nTrixie: Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie prevails.\nRainbow Dash: There's no need to go struttin' around and showin' off like that.\nTrixie: Oh?\nRainbow Dash: That's my job!\n[electric guitar music]\nRainbow Dash: They don't call me \"Rainbow\" and \"Dash\" for nothin'!\nAudience: [cheers]\nTrixie: When Trixie is through, the only thing they'll call you is loser.\n[rapid music]\nRainbow Dash: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-a-a-a! [gulp] I think I'm [gulp] gonna be sick.\nTrixie: Seems like anypony with a dash of good sense would think twice before tussling with the Great Trixie.\n[thunder]\nRainbow Dash: Ow!\n[laughter]\nSpike: What we need is another unicorn to challenge her. Someone with some magic of her own.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! A unicorn to show this unicorn who's boss.\nApplejack: A real unicorn to unicorn tussle.\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh...\nRarity: Enough. Enough, all of you. I take your hint, but Rarity is above such nonsense. Rainbow Dash and Applejack may behave like ruffians, but Rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace.\nTrixie: Ooo, what's the matter? Afraid you'll get a hair out of place in that rat's nest you call a mane?\nRarity: Oh, it. Is. On! You may think you're tough with all of your so-called powers, but there's more to magic than your brutish ways. A unicorn needs to be more than just muscle. A unicorn needs to have style.\nAudience: Ooh!\nRarity: A unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty.\nSpike: Rarity won't let Trixie get the best of her! She's strong, she's beautiful, she's\u2014\nAudience: [gasps]\nRarity: Quick! I need a mirror! Get me a mirror! What did she do to my hair? I know she did something terrible to my hair!\nTwilight Sparkle: Nothing.\nRainbow Dash: It's fine.\nApplejack: It's gorgeous.\nSpike: It's green. What?\nRarity: Ugh, no. Green hair! Not green hair! [cries] Such an awful, awful color! [cries]\nGolden Harvest: Well, I never!\nSpike: Well Twilight, guess it's up to you. Come on, show her what you're made of.\nTwilight Sparkle: What do you mean? I'm nothing special.\nSpike: Yes, you are! You're better than her!\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm not better than anyone.\nTrixie: Hah! You think you're better than the Great and Powerful Trixie? You think you have more magical talent? Well, come on, show Trixie what you've got. Show us all.\nTwilight Sparkle: Who, me? I'm just your run-of-the-mill citizen of Ponyville. No powerful magic here. I, uh... I think I hear my laundry calling. Sorry, gotta go.\nSpike: Twilight?\nTrixie: Ha! Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie has proven herself to be the most amazing unicorn in all of Equestria. Huh, was there ever any doubt?\n\nSnips: Here's the oat smoothie you asked for, with extra hay, just how you like it.\nSnails: Mmm, hay.\nTrixie: [sips] Yes?\nSnips: Ooo, tell us another story, Great and Powerful Trixie.\nSnails: Yeah, tell us about how you vanquished the ursa major.\nTrixie: Guh! Trixie is far too exhausted from performing feats beyond imagination. Begone with you until morning.\nSnails: Oh, of course, Great and Powerful Trixie.\nSnips: Anything you say. We are at your beck and call.\nTrixie: Ah.\nSpike: What are you two doin'?\nSnips: Just bringin' the Gee an' Pee Tee a\u2014\nSpike: The what?\nSnips: The Great and Powerful Trixie.\nSpike: Sheesh.\nSnips: Just bringin' her a smoothie.\nSpike: How can you fall for her lameness? She's just a show-off. Unlike Twilight, who\u2014\nSnips: The Great and Powerful Trixie vanquished an ursa major. Can your Twilight claim that?\nSpike: Oh really? Were you guys actually there?\nSnips: Well, eh, uh... no, but\u2014\nSpike: But nothin'. The proof is in the pudding.\nSnails: [laughs] I like pudding.\nSpike: Look, unless an ursa major comes waltzing up the street for Trixie to vanquish, I am not gonna believe a word she says, and neither should you!\nSnips: Hm, an ursa walkin' up the street, hey? Snails! You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?\nSnails: Why is it they call it a flea market when they don't really sell fleas?\nSnips: Yeah, uh... oh, come on!\n\nSpike: Twilight, would you put down that book and just listen to me?\nTwilight Sparkle: Didn't you see how they hated Trixie's bragging, Spike? If I go out there and show off my magic, I run the risk of losing them as friends.\nSpike: It's not the same thing, Twilight. You'll be using your magic to stand up for your friends!\nTwilight Sparkle: No, Spike, it's exactly the same.\nSpike: Come on, Twilight, any one of these tricks, even the teeniest, would be enough to show up Trixie.\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't want to be seen as a bragger like Trixie.\n[door slam, door open]\nSpike: But you're the best!\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh. Please, Spike, I said no!\nSpike: [sighs] If that's the way you want to be, then fine.\n[door slam, door open]\n\n[spooky music and sounds]\nSnips: Oh, how we gonna find an ursa major when I can't even see my own hoof in front of my face?\nSnails: Hold on. [grunts]\nSnips: Oh, heh. That's better.\n[growl]\nSnails: Yaaaah!\nSnips: Yaaaah!\nUrsa: [roar]\n\nSnips: [screaming]\nSpike: Hey, guys, where ya goin'?\nSnails: [breathing hard]\nSnips: Can't talk now.\nSnails: Got a major problem!\nSnips: Yeah, ursa major, to be exact.\n[roar]\nSpike: Huh?\nUrsa: [roar]\nSnips and Snails: Trixie!\nSpike: Twilight!\n\n[banging on door]\nSnips and Snails: Trixie! [mingled speech]\nTrixie: Trixie thought she said the Great and Powerful Trixie did not want to be disturbed!\nSnips: [nervous laughter] We\u2014 We have a\u2014 a tiny problem.\nSnails: Actually, it's a big one.\nTrixie: What is so important that you cannot wait until morning to disturb Trixie?\n[roar]\nUrsa: [roar]\nTrixie: [screams]\nSnips and Snails: [screams]\nUrsa: [roar]\n\nSpike: Twilight! You've gotta come! Quick!\nTwilight Sparkle: I already told you, Spike, I don't wanna show up Trixie!\nSpike: No, you don't understand, it's\u2014\n[roar]\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, is that what I think it is?\nSpike: Majorly.\n\nSnips: Great and Powerful Trixie, you've got to vanquish the ursa.\nSnails: Yeah, vanquish so we can watch.\nSnips: It took a lot of trouble to get that thing here.\nTrixie: Wait, you brought this here? [gasp] Are you out of your little pony minds?\nSnips: But, you're the Great and Powerful Trixie.\nSnails: Yeah, remember? You defeated an ursa major.\nUrsa: [roar]\nTrixie: Uh, okay. [gulp] Stand back.\n[snake charmer music]\nTrixie: Heh. Piece of cake.\n[growls, snap]\nSnips: Aw, come on, Trixie.\nSnails: Stop goofin' around and vanquish it, eh?\nTrixie: [gasp, gulp]\n[thunder]\nSnails: Well, that was a dud.\nSnips: Yeah, pfft, come on! Where's all the cool explosions and smoke and stuff like earlier? You know.\n[crackle]\nTrixie: Uh-oh.\nUrsa: [roar]\nSnips, Snails, and Trixie: [screams]\nUrsa: [roar]\n[ponies gasp]\nUrsa: [roar]\n[crash]\n[ponies crying in fear]\nTwilight Sparkle: What's going on?\nSnips: We brought an ursa to town.\nTwilight Sparkle: You what?!\nSnails: Don't worry, the Great and Powerful Trixie will vanquish it.\nTrixie: I can't.\nSnips and Snails: What?!\nTrixie: Oh, I can't, I never have. No one can vanquish an ursa major. I just made the whole story up to make me look better.\nSnips and Snails: Made it up?!\nUrsa: [growl] [roar]\n[ponies gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gulp]\nUrsa: [growl]\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\n[wind]\n[music from broken cattails]\nUrsa: [growl] [grunt] [guttural sigh]\nSpike: Nice use of number sixteen.\n[metallic sounds]\n[water flowing]\n[milking sounds and moos]\nUnidentified cow: Golly, dont'cha know?\nSpike: That's new.\n[metallic clank]\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\nUrsa: [sucking]\n[cheering]\nRainbow Dash: Unbelievable!\nSpike: That was amazing!\nApplejack: Heavens to Betsy! We knew you had ability, but not that much!\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sorry. Please, please don't hate me.\nRainbow Dash, Applejack, and Rarity: Hate you?\nRarity: Why, whatever do you mean, darling?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, I know how much you all hated Trixie's showing off with her magic tricks, and I just thought--\nRainbow Dash: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Magic's got nothing to do with it. Trixie's just a loudmouth.\nRarity: Most unpleasant.\nApplejack: All hat and no cattle.\nTwilight Sparkle: So, you don't mind my magic tricks?\nApplejack: Your magic is a part of who you are, sugarcube, and we like who you are. We're proud to have such a powerful, talented unicorn as our friend.\nRainbow Dash: And after whuppin' that ursa's hindquarters, we're even prouder.\nTwilight Sparkle: You are?\nRainbow Dash: Uh-huh.\nApplejack: Mm-hmm.\nRarity: Mm-hmm.\nSpike: Wow, Twilight, how'd you know what to do with that ursa major?\nTwilight Sparkle: That's what I was doing when you came looking for me. I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that I was compelled to do a little reading up on them.\nSpike: So it is possible to vanquish an ursa major all by yourself?\nTwilight Sparkle: That wasn't an ursa major. It was a baby, an ursa minor.\nTrixie: That was just a baby?\nTwilight Sparkle: And it wasn't rampaging. It was just cranky because someone woke it up.\nSnips and Snails: Awww...\nSpike: Well, if that was an ursa minor, then what's an ursa major like?\nTwilight Sparkle: You don't wanna know.\nTrixie: Huh. You may have vanquished an ursa minor, but you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie!\n[retreating hoofbeats]\nRainbow Dash: Why, that little...\nTwilight Sparkle: Just let her go. Maybe someday she'll learn her lesson. Now, about you two.\nSnips: Ah [nervous laughter]. Uh, we're sorry that we woke up the ursa minor.\nSnails: We just wanted to see some awesome magic.\nSnips: Yeah! And the way you vanquished that ursa minor was awesome!\nSnails: We deserve whatever punishment you give us.\nTwilight Sparkle: For starters, you can clean up this mess. And... What do you think, Spike? Should I give them number twenty five?\nSpike: Oh, twenty five! Yes! And I think I deserve it, too.\nSnips and Snails: Heah?\nTwilight Sparkle: I think you're right.\nSnips, Snails, and Spike: Sweet!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Dear Princess Celestia,\nI have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship: I was so afraid of being thought of as a show-off that I was hiding a part of who I am. My friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud of your talents, and there are times when it's appropriate to show them off... Especially when you're standing up for your friends.\nSpike: So, you finally admit that you're the most talented unicorn in all of Ponyville?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, yeah, but it's nothing to brag about. So, uh, how did it go with Rarity?\nSpike: Eh, she didn't go for the mustache.\nTwilight Sparkle: You know, Spike, that mustache has nothing to do with who you really are. Maybe you should just try being yourself.\nSpike: Or... Maybe the mustache wasn't enough. Maybe if I had a mustache and a beard?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, not this again!\nSpike: Okay, imagine me with a nice, long, Fu Manchu type beard. Or maybe a goatee. Oh, no, a soul patch right on my chin!\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nFluttershy: [spits] Not too fast now, Angel Bunny. You don't wanna get a tummy ache.

His snoring is what's causing all this smoke.\nPinkie Pie: He should really see a doctor. That doesn't sound healthy at all.\nRarity: Well, at least he's not snoring fire. What are we meant to do about it?\nRainbow Dash: I'll tell you what we're meant to do: give him the boot! Take that.

[panting]\nRainbow Dash: Told you it was going to take them forever.\n\nFluttershy: [gulp]\nTwilight Sparkle: Your turn, Fluttershy.\nFluttershy: But... it's so... wide.\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on, Fluttershy, we should be much farther along by now.\nApplejack: You could just leap on over.\nFluttershy: I-\n[dragon snore]\nFluttershy: I don't know.\nPinkie Pie: There's nothing to be afraid of. It's just a hop, skip and a jump. See?\n\n[Pinkie Pie]\nIt's not very far\nJust move your little rump\nYou can make it if you try with a hop, skip and jump\n\nIt's not very far\nJust move your little rump\nYou can make it if you try with a hop, skip and jump\n\nTwilight Sparkle: We don't have time for this.\n\n[Pinkie Pie]\nA hop, skip and jump,\nJust move your little rump,\nA hop, skip and jump,\nA hop, skip and jump,\nA hop, skip and jump,\nA hop skip and jump,\nA hop skip and jump!\nFluttershy: O-okay. Here I go. A hop...\nApplejack: That's it.\nTwilight Sparkle: You've got it.\nRarity: Almost there.\nFluttershy: Skip...\nTwilight Sparkle: Just don't look down.\nFluttershy: [whimpers]\nRainbow Dash: Ugh.\nFluttershy: I guess I forgot to jump.\n\nA hop, skip and jump,\nJust move your little rump,\nA hop, skip and jump,\nA hop, skip and jump,\nA hop, skip and jump,\nA hop skip and jump,\nA hop skip and jump!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [whispers] Let's keep it down. According to my map, we're entering an avalanche zone. The smallest peep could cause a huge rock slide.\nFluttershy: An... an ava... ava...\nTwilight Sparkle: Shhh!\nFluttershy: AVALA-!\n[collective sigh]\n[rumble]\nPonies: Avalanche! [cries]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh no! Help! Ooh!\n[coughing]\nApplejack: Oh my! [stops coughing] Everypony okay?\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks to you I am.\nRarity: Eugh. Blech.\nPinkie Pie: Whoo-hoo! Let's do it again!\nRarity: Uh! This is why a girl always packs extra accessories. Oh, please tell me I brought the tiara that goes with this.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, think we got bigger problems than making sure our hair bows match our horseshoes.\nFluttershy: [sigh] Sorry.\nApplejack: Aw, no big whoop, sugarcube.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah, we'll just have to [sigh] climb over.\n\n[grunts]\n\nFluttershy: [sigh] [whimpers]\nRarity: [cry]\nApplejack: Wha! Wha...\nRarity: My apologies.\nRainbow Dash: Not your fault.\nFluttershy: [whimper]\nRainbow Dash: [sigh] Still think it was a good idea to bring Fluttershy along?\nTwilight Sparkle: We're about to find out. We're here.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash, you'll use your wings to clear the smoke.\nRainbow Dash: Mm-hmm.\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity and Pinkie Pie, you'll create a diversion to distract the dragon if things get a little hairy in there.\n[squeaky toy]\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack, you're ready with the apples in case he decides to attack. But it shouldn't come to that, because Fluttershy will do what she needs to do to wake him up, and between the two of us, we should be able to get him to understand why he needs to go. Is everypony ready?\n[affirmatives]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay then, we're goin' in. So, what is the best way to wake up a sleeping dragon without upsetting him? Fluttershy? Oh, come on! Come on! [grunt] We have to do this! [grunt] Now! Every [grunts] second longer that dragon [grunts] sleeps is another [grunts] acre of Equestria that is covered in [grunts] smoke. Ooh!\nPinkie Pie: [laugh]\nFluttershy: I- I- I can't go in the cave.\nPonies: Ugh. [crash]\nRainbow Dash: Oh, great. She's scared of caves now, too.\nFluttershy: I'm not scared of caves, I'm scared of [mumble].\nApplejack: What's that, sugarcube?\nFluttershy: I'm scared of [mumble].\nTwilight Sparkle: What?\nFluttershy: I'm scared of dragons!\n[dragon snore]\nFluttershy: [squeal]\n[coughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: But Fluttershy. You have a wonderful talent dealing with all kinds of animals.\nFluttershy: Yes, because they're not dragons.\nRainbow Dash: Oh come on! We've seen you walk right up to a horrible manticore like it was nothing.\nFluttershy: Yes, because he wasn't a dragon.\nPinkie Pie: Spike is a dragon. You're not scared of him.\nFluttershy: Yes, because he's not a huge, gigantic, terrifying, enormous, teeth-gnashing, sharp-scale having, horn-wearing, smoke-snoring, could eat a pony in one bite, totally all grown-up dragon!\n[dragon snore]\nFluttershy: [whimper]\nTwilight Sparkle: But, if you're so afraid of dragons, why didn't you say something before we came all the way up here?\nFluttershy: I was afraid to.\nRainbow Dash: Ugh.\nApplejack: All of us are scared of that dragon.\nRainbow Dash: I'm not!\nApplejack: Almost all of us are scared of that dragon, but we've got a job to do. So, get in there with Twilight and show her what you're made of.\nFluttershy: I- I- I just... can't.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Fluttershy.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm goin' in. He... probably just doesn't realize what he's doing... right?\n[ponies agree nervously]\nTwilight Sparkle: Mr. Dragon.\nRazer: [rumble]\nTwilight Sparkle: Excuse me.\nRazer: [rumble]\nTwilight Sparkle: Mr. Dragon.\nRazer: [rumble]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, good, you're awake. Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Twilight-\nRazer: [yawn]\nTwilight Sparkle: Augh! Puh! Sparkle, and my friends and I are residents here in Equestria. Ponyville, to be exact. We've come here to ask that you find another spot to take your nap. It's just that you seem to be doing an awful lot of snoring, and every time you do you send out a terrible cloud of smoke. [coughs] Equestria simply can't survive a hundred years in a dark haze. You understand, don't you?\nRazer: [stretches] [grunts]\nTwilight Sparkle: So, you'll find another place to sleep? [coughs]\nRazer: [huff]\nPonies: [coughing]\nRainbow Dash: So much for [coughs] persuading him.\nApplejack: Now what?\nRarity: [coughs] Obviously, this situation just calls for a little \"pony charm\". Allow me, girls. [to Razor] I'm so sorry to interru-upt, [clears throat] but I couldn't possibly head back home without mentioning what handsome scales you have. And those scales have to be hidden away in some silly cave for a hundred years?\nRazer: [rumble]\nRarity: Personally, I think you should skip the snoozing and be out there, showing them off! Hmm. Obviously, I would be more than happy to keep an eye on your jewels while you're gone.\nRazer: [growl]\nRarity: [cry]\n\nRarity: I was this close to getting that diamond.\nTwilight Sparkle: You mean... getting rid of that dragon?\nRarity: Oh, yeah... sure.\n[horn]\nApplejack: What in tarnation...?\nPinkie Pie: [horn]\nRarity: Darling, you look ridiculous.\nPinkie Pie: Exactly! Sharing a laugh is a sure-fire way to get someone on your side! Hi!\n[crash]\nPinkie Pie: Apparently he doesn't like laughing, heh. Or sharing.\nRainbow Dash: All right, that's it. We tried persuasion, charm, whatever it is Pinkie Pie does.\nPinkie Pie: [busted horn]\nRainbow Dash: It's time to stop wasting time! I'm going in!\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow, no!\nRainbow Dash: Get! Out! [smack]\nRazer: [sneeze] [growl]\nRainbow Dash: Heh. Sorry.\nRazer: [roars]\nRainbow Dash: Who-o-o-o-o-a!\n[tenpins]\nPonies: Ugh!\n[roar]\n[screams]\nRazer: [roar]\nPonies: [moans]\nRazer: [rumble]\nPonies: [moans]\nFluttershy: How dare you... How dare you! Listen here, mister. Just because you're big doesn't mean you get to be a bully! You may have huge teeth, and sharp scales, and snore smoke, and breathe fire. But you do not\u2014I repeat\u2014you do not! Hurt! My! Friends! You got that?\nRazer: [whimper]\nFluttershy: Well?\nRazer: But that rainbow one kicked me.\nFluttershy: And I am very sorry about that. But you're bigger than she is, and you should know better. You should also know better than to take a nap where your snoring can become a health hazard to other creatures.\nRazer: But I-\nFluttershy: Don't you 'but I' me, mister. Now what do you have to say for yourself? I said, what do you have to say for yourself?\nRazer: [whimper] [crying]\nFluttershy: There, there. No need to cry. You're not a bad dragon, you just made a bad decision. Now go pack your things. You just need to find a new place to sleep. That's all.\nPonies: [cheering]\nTwilight Sparkle: You did it! I knew you could do it.\n\nSpike: [pant] I said come back here! Ooh! How does Fluttershy put up with you furry little things?\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, take a letter.\nSpike: [sigh] With pleasure.\nTwilight Sparkle: Dear Princess Celestia,\nI am happy to report that the dragon has departed our fair country, and that it was my good friend, Fluttershy, who convinced him to go. This adventure has taught me to never lose faith in your friends. They can be an amazing source of strength, and can help you overcome even your greatest fears.\nAlways your faithful student,\nTwilight Sparkle.\nApplejack: Twilight! You gotta come see this! She's just five away from a new pony record!\nRainbow Dash: Three hundred forty-seven, three hundred forty-eight...\n[roar]\nRainbow Dash: Dragon!\n[goat bleat]\n[laughter]\nRainbow Dash: [pants] Why are you laughing? That awful dragon is back!\nPinkie Pie: [roar]\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie Pie, you scared me! I mean, uh, you... broke my concentration.\nFluttershy: It's okay, Rainbow Dash.

Perfect.\nApplejack: [spit] Just take the broken limbs down, Rarity. Don't y'all care about nothin' other than prettifyin'?\nRarity: Somepony has to. You were making an absolute mess of the town square, Applejack.\nApplejack: Yeah, well, the storm's gonna make an even bigger mess if we don't prune all these loose branches so they don't tumble down on anypony.\nRarity: I simply cannot imagine why the Pegasus ponies would schedule a dreadful downpour this evening and ruin what could have been a glorious sunny day.\nApplejack: [sigh] Think more practical-like, will ya? They accidentally skipped a scheduled sprinkle last week, so we need a doozy of a downpour to make up for it, is all.\n[rain pouring down]\nRarity: Oh no! My wonderfully styled mane shall be ruined!\nApplejack: Ya shoulda hurried up and finished the job already.\nRarity: Oh! Ah! Oh! Ph! It's coming down too fast! Ah! Oh! Oh! Ah! Help me!\nApplejack: Uh, there. Hunker down to yer heart's content whilst I finish things.\nRarity: [pant] Oh, no, no, no!\nApplejack: What now?\nRarity: I prefer not to get my hooves muddy.\nApplejack: Guh. There is just no pleasin' ya, is there? Everything's got to be just so.\nRarity: [scoff] Well, and how does muddying my hooves serve any useful purpose?\nApplejack: Y'all wouldn't know useful if it came up and bit'cha.\nRarity: [laugh] That doesn't even make any sense.\nApplejack: Does so.\nRarity: Does not.\nApplejack: Does so.\nRarity: Does not.\nApplejack: Does so.\nRarity: Does not.\nApplejack: Does so infinity. Hah.\nRarity: Does not infinity plus one. Heh. What say we go our separate ways before one of us says something she will regret?\nApplejack: I reckon y'all are gonna say something you'll regret first.\nRarity: On the contrary, I believe it shall most certainly be you who says something you will regret first.\nApplejack: I'm not sayin' anythin'.\nRarity: Nor am I.\nApplejack: Y'all just be on yer way, then.\nRarity: After you!\n[thunder cracks]\nApplejack and Rarity: [yelp]\nRarity: Perhaps we should stick together for now and find some shelter.\nApplejack: Uh-huh, perhaps we should.

Rarity!\nApplejack and Rarity: Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Come inside girls, quick.\nApplejack: Whoa, nelly. Is inside a tree really the best place to be in a lightning storm?\nTwilight Sparkle: It is if you have a magical lightning rod protecting your home like I do. Come on in!\nRarity: Hah! We are most grateful for your invitation.\nApplejack: Thank ya kindly for yer hospitality.\nRarity: Uh, do be a polite house guest and go wash up please, won't you?\nApplejack: [grumble] If I gotta spend one more second with that fussbudget Rarity today, I can't be held responsible for what I'm gonna do.\nTwilight Sparkle: Some storm, huh? The Pegasus ponies sure have outdone themselves this time. I hope you and Applejack don't have any trouble getting home.\nRarity: It may indeed be a problem.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, you're welcome to stay if need be. Spike is away in Canterlot on royal business. I'm home all alone tonight. [gasp] You and Applejack should totally sleep over! We'll have a slumber party! I've always wanted one of those.\nRarity: Oh! Uh, goodness. Uh, I do believe I have another engagement scheduled for this evening that completely slipped my mind until just now. [nervous laugh] Ah, silly me, I can't possibly stay here all night -- with Applejack. [reading] Slumber 101: All You've Ever Wanted to Know About Slumber Parties But Were Afraid to Ask.\nTwilight Sparkle: My own personal copy. It's a fantastic reference guide. You should see the table of contents. I've been waiting for a chance to use it, and today is the day! This is gonna be so great!\nRarity: Yes, uh, great. [nervous laughter]\n\nApplejack: [gasp] What in tarnation... Now wait just a goll-darn minute. Ya make me wash the mud off my hooves, but it's okay for y'all to have mud all over yer faces?\nRarity: Silly! This is called a mud mask. It's to refresh and rejuvenate your complexion.\nTwilight Sparkle: We're giving each other makeovers! Eee-hee! We have to do it, it says so in the book.\nApplejack: Slumber 101: Everything You... Oh hey, heh, would'ja look at the time. I gotta skidaddle on home quick. I'm powerful late for, uh, fer somethin'. Uh, g'night. [cry] Or maybe I'll sit here for a spell.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hurray slumber party!\nApplejack: Blahch. What in the world is this for?\nRarity: [sigh] To reduce the puffiness around one's eyes, of course.\nApplejack: Puffiness-schmuffiness! That's good eatin'! [chews loudly]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hee-hee! Isn't this exciting? We'll do everything by the book, and that will make my slumber party officially fun.\nRarity: Did you hear that, Applejack? You certainly would not want to do anything that would ruin Twilight's very first slumber party, would you?\nApplejack: Of course not, 'n you wouldn't either, I reckon?\nRarity: So do we have an agreement?\nApplejack: You betcha. [spit]\nRarity: Oh! Gross! You know, there's messy and there's just plain rude.\nApplejack: You know, there's fussy, 'n there's just plain gettin' on my nerves.\nRarity: Fortunately, I can get along with anypony, no matter how difficult she may be.\nApplejack: Oh yeah? Well, I'm the \"get-alongin-est\" pony you're ever gonna meet.\nRarity: That's not even a word.\nTwilight Sparkle: This is going to be the bestest slumber party ever! Yay!\nApplejack and Rarity: Yay.\n\nRarity: So, how are you getting along over there, Applejack?\nApplejack: Just fine, Rarity.\nTwilight Sparkle: This is so awesome! [giggle] Makeovers, check. Ooh, it says here we have to tell ghost stories. Who wants to go first?\nApplejack: Me! I'd like to tell y'all the terrifying tale of the prissy ghost who drove everypony crazy with her unnecessary neatness. Oo-oo! I'm sure y'all are familiar with that one?\nRarity: Never heard of it, but I have a much better one. It's the horrifying story of the messy, inconsiderate ghost who irritated everypony within a hundred miles! Oo-oo!\nApplejack: That's not a real story. You made it up.\nRarity: It is a ghost story, they're all made up.\n[screams]\nTwilight Sparkle: I've got one! This story is called The Legend of The Headless Horse. It was a dark and stormy night, just like this one. And three ponies were having a slumber party, just like this one...\n\nTwilight Sparkle: ...and just when the last pony thought she was safe, there, standing right behind her, just inches away was... the Headless Horse!\nApplejack and Rarity: [gasp] [scream]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ghost story, check. Now, who wants s'mores?\n\nRarity: Then you place one marshmallow on the top of the chocolate and be sure it's centered\u2014that's critical\u2014and then carefully put another perfectly square graham cracker on the top. And done. Ta-da! [laugh]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ooo!\nApplejack: Nah, ya just eat 'em. [munch] Mmm-mmm! [belch]\nRarity: [sigh] You could at least say excuse me.\nApplejack: Aw, I was just about to, but you interrupted me. Pardon.\nTwilight Sparkle: S'mores, check. Now the next item of fun we have to do is Truth or Dare.\nRarity: I dare Applejack to do something carefully and neatly for a change.\nApplejack: Oh yeah? Well I dare Rarity ta lighten up and stop obsessin' over every last little detail, for a change.\nRarity: I think the truth of the matter is that somepony could stand to pay a little more attention to details.\nApplejack: And I think the truth is somepony oughta quit with her fussin' so the rest of us can get things done.\nTwilight Sparkle: Um, I don't think this is how the game's supposed to work. You have to give an honest answer to any question or do whatever anypony dares you to do.\nApplejack: I dares you to step outside and let your precious, tidy mane get ruined again.\nRarity: [gasps]\nTwilight Sparkle: You have to. It's the rule.\nApplejack: Hah!\nRarity: Fine! [cries]\nApplejack: [snickers] [laughs]\nRarity: Okay. I dare Applejack to play dress-up in a frou-frou, glittery, lacey outfit.\nApplejack: [gasp] Happy?\nRarity: Very. [smirk]\nTwilight Sparkle: Um, do I ever get a turn?\nApplejack: I dare ya to enter the next rodeo when it comes to town.\nRarity: I dare you not to enter the next rodeo that comes to town.\nApplejack: I dare ya to not comb your mane a hundred times before bed.\nRarity: And I dare you to comb yours just once.\nTwilight Sparkle: I, uh, I think we should check off Truth or Dare and move on. Let's see what our next fun-fun-fun thing is, shall we? Hm, what does this mean? Pillow fight?\nRarity: Oh, please. I am not at all interested in participating in something so crude. Oh! It! Is! On! [grunt]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, I get it! Pillow, fight! Fun! Ugh. Ah. Uh, girls? Maybe we should take it down a notch?\nApplejack: I will if she will.\nRarity: [gasp] She started it.\nTwilight Sparkle: [spit] Maybe we should just call it a night and get some sleep?\n\nRarity: Keep your muddy hooves on your side of the bed.\nApplejack: My hooves ain't muddy.\nRarity: They were. There might still be a little on them.\nApplejack: There ain't. See?\nRarity: Eww!\nApplejack: Now who's bein' inconsiderate?\nRarity: I have to make the bed again so the blanket will be right. Get up.\nApplejack: Hey!\nRarity: Ah ah ah! You'll ruin it. You have to do it like this. Mm, uh, ooh, u-u-u-uh, uh, ah.\nApplejack: Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Geronimo!\nRarity: Hey!\nApplejack: Ah.\nRarity: You did that on purpose.\nApplejack: Um, yeah?\nRarity: Get up so I can fix it again.\nApplejack: Can't hear ya, I'm asleep. [snore]\nRarity: M-mmm!\nApplejack: I ain't budgin'.\nRarity: You will if you want any blankets.\nApplejack: Give it back!\nRarity: I will not!\nApplejack: Yes, you will!\nRarity: Won't!\nApplejack: Will!\nRarity: Won't!\nApplejack: Will!\nRarity: Won't!\nApplejack: Will!\nTwilight Sparkle: Enough! It says right here that the number one thing you're supposed to do at a slumber party is have fun, and thanks to you two I can't check that off!\nApplejack: I've been tryin' my darndest to get along.\nRarity: No, it is I who have been trying my best.\nApplejack: No, it was me.\nRarity: No, it was I.\nApplejack: Me!\nRarity: I!\nTwilight Sparkle: I hope you're happy, both of you. You've ruined my very first slumber party. The makeover, the s'mores, Truth or Dare, the pillow fight... I mean, is there anything else that could possibly go wrong?\n[lightning strikes]\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry I asked.\n\nApplejack, Rarity and Twilight: [gasp]\nApplejack: Ya see? That's why we needed to take down all those loose branches in town, not spiffy 'em up.\nRarity: But I--\nApplejack: Outta my way, missy! Time's a-wastin'.\nRarity: Wait! Stop! Don't!\nApplejack: No waitin'! No stoppin'! Doin'! And that, my friends, is what we call gettin' 'er done.\nRarity: [cry]\nTwilight Sparkle: [cry]\n[crash]\nRarity: [cries] I tried to tell you it would come crashing down in here.\nApplejack: Well, ya shoulda tried harder. [sigh] I'm mighty sorry, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's... Well, it's not okay. There's a giant tree branch in the middle of my bedroom, and the book doesn't say anything about having a giant tree branch at your slumber party. Or at least I haven't found that entry yet. Ooh... ah!\nApplejack: What in tarnation are y'all doin' over there?\nRarity: Cleaning up this mess somepony made. Who was that again? Oh, right, that's you.\nApplejack: We gotta do somethin'!\nTwilight Sparkle: Baking... BFFs... Brothers... There's nothing in here about branches.\nApplejack: [grunts] Rarity, for pony's sake, stop sweatin' the small stuff and help me get rid of this thing! I said hussle over here and help me! Look, I'm sorry, all right?\nRarity: What was that?\nApplejack: I said I'm sorry! I shoulda listened to you when you noticed where this here branch would end up. Yer annoyin' attention to detail would'a saved us from this whole mess. But right now, ya need to stop bein' so dang fussy pickin' up all the little things and help me move the one big thing in here that actually matters! Please!\nRarity: Uh. Uh, but I'll get all icky.\nApplejack: Consarnit! What the... eh... you... I mean, yes, ickiness is often a side effect of hard work. But y'all need to get over it, on account I just can't fix this mess I made myself. I need your help.\nRarity: Oh. Let's do this.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, they do have a section about backyard slumber parties. Is that what we're doing right now? Does this count as camping?\nRarity: [grunt]\nApplejack: [grunt]\nRarity: U-ugh. Oh, I look awful.\nApplejack: Better?\nRarity: Hmph, thanks.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, pretty! Where did these come from? They're not in the book either.\n\nApplejack, Rarity and Twilight: [laughter]\nApplejack: Is it bigger than a barn?\nTwilight Sparkle: [laugh] Nope.\nRarity: Is it smaller than a saddle?\nTwilight Sparkle: [laugh] No! Only three of your twenty questions left!\nApplejack: [sigh] We're never gonna guess what you're thinkin' of, it could be anythin'.\nRarity: Are we getting warmer?\nTwilight Sparkle: Why? Is it too cold in here for you? I can turn up the heat.\nApplejack: She means are we gettin' any closer with our guesses?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh! No. And that technically counted as a question, so only two more left!\nApplejack: Is it... a six-legged pony with a purple polka-dotted mane and shootin' stars comin' out of his eyes?\nRarity: Who flies through the air all over the world to hide magic, sparkly eggs?\nTwilight Sparkle: That's it!\nApplejack and Rarity: It is?\nTwilight Sparkle: No. [chuckle] It's that. But it was just so nice to see you two finally getting along, I wanted you to be able to win together.\nApplejack and Rarity: [laughter]\nTwilight Sparkle: See? We could have been having fun like this all along.\nApplejack: If only somepony hadn't been so persnickety.\nRarity: Well, maybe she wouldn't have been if somepony else hadn't been so sloppy.\nApplejack: Sorry for being such a pain in the patootie.\nRarity: Oh, no, I'm sure I was much worse.\nApplejack: That's kind of ya to say, but I'm the one who's sorry.\nRarity: Oh, I'm much more sorry than you are.\nApplejack: Ugh. Are not.\nRarity: Are too.\nApplejack: Are not!\nRarity: Are too.\nApplejack: Are not.\nRarity: Are too.\nApplejack and Rarity: [laughter]\nTwilight Sparkle: I declare my first slumber party a success!\nApplejack and Rarity: [cheers]\nTwilight Sparkle: Have fun, check.\nApplejack and Rarity: [laughter]\n\nRarity: Now take two steps to your left. Uh, no, my left.\nApplejack: Whu, which is it? [crash] Whoa! That mess is your fault, not mine. [laughter]\nRarity: [laughter] Sorry.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Dear Princess Celestia,\nIt's hard to believe that two ponies who seem to have so little in common could ever get along. But I found out that if you embrace each other's differences, you just might be surprised to discover a way to be friends after all.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: So, who's up for another slumber party tomorrow night? Ugh. How about a week from Thursday? Oh, how about two weeks from Saturday? A month from now?\nApplejack and Rarity: [laughter]\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow, what a gorgeous day!\nSpike: Rainbow Dash must have gotten up early for once and cleared all the clouds away.\nTwilight Sparkle: I bet all of Ponyville is going to be out enjoying the sunshine.

I've never seen a pony like that in these parts, 'cept... her!\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, she's probably not from here, and she's not a pony. My books say that zebras come from a faraway land.

The plants grow...\nFluttershy: Animals care for themselves...\nRainbow Dash: And the clouds move...\nApplejack, Fluttershy, and Rainbow Dash: All on their own!\nRarity: [faints]\nPinkie Pie: And that wicked enchantress Zecora lives there doing her evil... stuff! She's so evil I even wrote a song about her!\nRainbow Dash: Here we go...\n\n[Pinkie Pie]\nShe's an evil enchantress\nShe does evil dances\nAnd if you look deep in her eyes\nShe'll put you in trances\nThen what will she do?\nShe'll mix up an evil brew\nThen she'll gobble you up\nIn a big tasty stew\nSoooo... Watch out!\nPinkie Pie: [heavy breathing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow. Catchy.\nPinkie Pie: It's a work in progress.\nTwilight Sparkle: This is all just a lot of gossip and rumors. Now tell me; what exactly have you actually seen Zecora do?\nRainbow Dash: Well... Once a month, she comes into Ponyville.\nTwilight Sparkle: [dramatically] Oooooh.\nRarity: Then, she lurks by the stores.\nTwilight Sparkle: [dramatically] Oh, my.\nFluttershy: And then, she digs at the ground.\nTwilight Sparkle: [dramatically] Good gracious! [normal tone] Okay, I'm sorry. But how is any of this bad? Maybe she comes to town to visit?\nApple Bloom: Yeah! Maybe she's just tryin' to be neighborly.\nTwilight Sparkle: And maybe she's not lurking by the stores, maybe she's going to them, lurk free, to do some shopping?\nApple Bloom: Yeah! Everypony likes to shop. You know what I think?\nApplejack: Apple Bloom! Hush and let the big ponies talk.\nApple Bloom: [under breath] I am a big pony!\nRainbow Dash: W-what about digging at the ground? You've got to admit that's weird.\nFluttershy: What if she's digging for innocent creatures?\n[Pinkie Pie sings \"Evil Enchantress\" in the background]\nTwilight Sparkle: I am sure there is an explanation for everything Zecora does. And if anypony here were actually brave enough to approach her, she would find out the truth.\nApple Bloom: Well, I'm brave enough; I'm gonna find out myself. [gasps]\n\nShe's an evil enchantress\nShe does evil dances\nAnd if you look deep in her eyes\nShe'll put you in trances\nThen what will she do?\nShe'll mix up an evil brew\nThen she'll gobble you up\nIn a big tasty stew\nSoooo... Watch out!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: You ponies are being ridiculous!\nPinkie Pie: Well, I heard that Zecora eats hay.\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie, I eat hay; you eat hay!\nPinkie Pie: Yeah, but I heard it's the evil way she eats hay.\nApplejack: Hey! Where's Apple Bloom?\nFluttershy: The door's open.\nRarity: She went outside!\nRainbow Dash: And Zecora's still out there.\nApplejack: [sigh] That silly lil' filly! I told her to stay put!\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, you stay here in case Apple Bloom comes back.\nSpike: Will do!\n\nApple Bloom: [gulps]\nApplejack: Apple Bloom?\nApple Bloom: [gasp]\nApplejack: You get back here right now!\nZecora: Beware! Beware, you pony folk! Those leaves of blue are not a joke!\nApplejack: Y-you keep your creepy mumbo-jumbo to yourself, ya hear?\n[Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity speak over each other against Zecora]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Oh brother.\nZecora: Beware! Beware!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, back at ya, Zecora! You and your lame curse are the ones who better beware!\nApplejack: And you! Why couldn't you just listen to yer big sister?\nApple Bloom: I...I...\nApplejack: Who knows what kind of nasty curse Zecora could have just put on you?\nPinkie Pie: Just like in my song! [Starts singing a shorter version of \"Evil Enchantress\"]\nTwilight Sparkle: You guys, there's no such thing as curses!\nRainbow Dash: Well, that's interesting to hear coming from Miss Magic Pants herself.\nTwilight Sparkle: My magic, real magic, comes from within. It's a skill you're born with. Curses are artificial, fake magic. It's conjured with potions and incantations; all smoke and mirrors meant to scare. But curses have no real power, they're just an old pony tale.\nApplejack: Just you wait, Twilight. You're gonna learn that some pony tales really are true.\n\n[dream sequence]\nPinkie Pie: She's an evil enchantress, she does evil dances!\nZecora: Beware! Beware!\nPinkie Pie: If you look deep in her eyes, she will put you in trances!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!\nRarity: Wicked, wicked zebra!\nFluttershy: ... it's a curse.\nPinkie Pie: Then what will she do?\nApplejack: Just you wait, Twilight; some pony tales really are true.\nPinkie Pie: Then she'll gobble you up in a big tasty stew! Soooo... Watch out!\nZecora: [evil laugh]\n\n[rooster crowing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh... what a dream... Curses, schmurses. Whoa! [chuckle] Maybe Zecora cursed my hair. [Laughs nervously and then gasps] Or she cursed my horn!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: No no no no no! None of these books have a cure! Ugh! There has to be a real reason for this! An illness? An allergy?!\nSpike: A curse!\nTwilight Sparkle: I said a real reason. Something that points to something real.\nSpike: How about this one?\nTwilight Sparkle: \"Supernaturals\"? Spike, the word supernatural refers to things like ghosts and spirits and zombies, which are as make-believe as curses. This book is just a bunch of hooey!\nSpike: But what if you're wrong, Twilight? What if this really is a\u2014\nPinkie Pie: Ah pfurse!\nSpike: A purse? How could it be a purse?\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie? What happened?\nPinkie Pie: Pee pah Zthecora! Sthe put a cursthe on me!\nSpike: Hey, say it, don't spray it, Pinkie!\nRainbow Dash: [thud] Ow! [thud] Oh! She's [thud] trying to say\u2014ow!\u2014Zecora [thud]\u2014oh!\u2014[crash] she slapped us all with a\u2014ow!\u2014curse!\nRarity: I'm afraid I have to agree. [Blows hair out of her face]\n[Spike and Twilight yell in surprise]\nApplejack: [high pitched voice] I hate to say I told ya so, Twilight, but I told ya so!\n[Spike and Twilight gasp]\nApplejack: It's a curse, I tells ya!\nTwilight Sparkle: But Fluttershy... seems just fine!\nRarity: Yes, there doesn't seem to be a thing wrong with her.\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy? Are you okay? Is there something wrong with you? Would you care to tell us? So... you're not going to tell us? Yes you're not, or yes you will?\nApplejack: Good gravy, girl! What's wrong with you?!\nFluttershy: [deep male voice] I don't want to talk about it.\n[Spike snorts, then bursts out laughing]\nSpike: This is hilarious! [laughs] Look at all of you! We got: Hairity, Rainbow Crash, Spitty Pie, Apple Teeny, Flutterguy, and... uh... I got nothin'... Twilight Sparkle. I mean seriously, I can't even work with that.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sarcastic laughter] This is no joke, Spike. Now start looking for more books so I can find a cure!\nSpike: [groan]\nRainbow Dash: [groans] I think we'll find a cure to this curse at Zecora's place!\nTwilight Sparkle: It's not a curse!\nApplejack: I agree with Dash! We'll go to Zecora's and force her to remove this hex!\nTwilight Sparkle: It's not a hex either!\n[Everyone but Apple Bloom and Spike shouting at once]\nApple Bloom: This is all my fault. If I hadn't followed Zecora in the first place, none of this would have happened. I just gotta fix this.\nApplejack: Now where does she think she's goin' this time?\n\nRainbow Dash: I don't care what you say, Twilight. It's time to pony up and confront Zecora. Come on, girls. Are you with me?\nPinkie Pie: Ah am-pft!\nRarity: And I as well.\nFluttershy: Uh, I don't know. Seems awfully dangerous.\nSpike: [giggle]\nRainbow Dash: How about you, Applejack? Applejack?\nPinkie Pie: Pf-she's gone-pft!\nRarity: Aah! Or somepony stepped on her!\nTwilight Sparkle: ... or sat on her?\nRainbow Dash: Rarity's hair!\nRarity: Oh! OH! Pinkie, what are you doing? Ah, really. Aah! You ever hear of personal space?\nPinkie Pie: Nopthe.\nTwilight Sparkle: Apple Bloom is gone too!\nRainbow Dash: I bet they went after Zecora.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well we better go find them. Come on girls, let's go.\nRarity: [grunt] Oh dear. Oh, this is so unseemly. Auuuaah!\nRainbow Dash: Hey, a little help here?\nFluttershy: Oopsie! Sorry.\nRainbow Dash: [crash] OW!\nFluttershy: Uh... Spike? Are you coming?\nSpike: Nope! Uh... gotta stay here and look for a cure. [gasp] Twilight Flopple!\n\nApplejack: Stop right there! Turn around right now, missy!\nApple Bloom: No.\nApplejack: No?! You can't ignore a direct order from your big sister!\nApple Bloom: Hehehe. Sorry, Applejack, but I'm the big sister now.\nApplejack: Apple Bloom, you come back here right this instant! I'm gonna tell Big McIntosh on you! Aw, pony feathers.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: C'mon girls. We've got to get to Zecora's. Hurry!\nRarity: Ooh... Ahaha. Easier said than done.\nRainbow Dash: Hey, wait for me! [screaming and owing]\nApplejack: Rainbow! Thank Celestia! There's no time to lose! I need to get to Zecora's pronto! Giddy-up pony!\nRainbow Dash: Ex-CUSE me?\nApplejack: YEEE-HAW!\nRainbow Dash: What the...\nApplejack: No, Rainbow Dash. Other way!\n\nRarity: Oh. I look horrible!\nPinkie Pie: Plis place plooks horrible!\nRarity: Oh my. That place really does look horrible. Nice decorations, if you like creepy!\n[Ponies gasp]\nZecora: [speaking in native language]\nPinkie Pie: Sthe sthtole my sthong! Shthe shtole mm mm!\nRarity: She stole your song?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh Pinkie. Doesn't sound anything like your song.\nPinkie Pie: Ah. Hmm... Pbth! [whimper]\nFluttershy: [sigh]\n\nShe's an evil enchantress\nAnd she does evil dances\nAnd if you look deep in her eyes\nShe will put you in trances\nThen what would she do?\nShe'll mix up an evil brew\nThen she'll gobble you up\nIn a big tasty stew\nSoooo... Watch out.\nRarity: You saw those terrible things. Now do you believe us Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Scary looking masks, confusing incantations, and a great big bubbling cauldron? [sigh] Everything is pointing to Zecora being... bad. Or... what if Zecora is just making soup?\nZecora: Mmm! The perfect temperature for ponies, I presume. Now, where is that little Apple Bloom?\nTwilight Sparkle: Or... what if she's making Apple Bloom soup?!\n\nShe's an evil enchantress\nAnd she does evil dances\nAnd if you look deep in her eyes\nShe will put you in trances\nThen what would she do?\nShe'll mix up an evil brew\nThen she'll gobble you up\nIn a big tasty stew\nSoooo... Watch out.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: What if she's making Apple Bloom soup?!\nTwilight Sparkle, Rarity, Pinkie Pie, and Fluttershy: [scream]\nApplejack: I'm comin' for ya, Apple Bloom!\nRainbow Dash: Aaah!\nZecora: [native language]\nApplejack: Whoa there. Easy, Rainbow Crash.\nZecora: Oh. [native language]\nRainbow Dash: [screams]\nZecora: [native language]\nTwilight Sparkle: What have you done with Apple Bloom?\nZecora: No! No! [native language]\nApplejack: [grunt]\nRainbow Dash: Ahh!\nZecora: Ponies! What is this you...\nRainbow Dash: [screams]\nZecora: No! You know not what you do! You've gone and spilled my precious brew!\nTwilight Sparkle: We're onto you Zecora. I didn't want to believe that you cursed us, but the evidence is overwhelming!\nRarity: You made me look ridiculous.\nFluttershy: You made me sound ridiculous!\nPinkie Pie: [incoherent] You made me speak ridiculous!\nTwilight Sparkle: You ruined my horn!\nZecora: How dare you! You destroy my home, destroy my work, then rudely accuse me of being a jerk?\nRainbow Dash: You put this curse on us, now you're gonna uncurse us.\nZecora: It is unwise to venture down this road. Your actions will make my anger explode!\nTwilight Sparkle: Where is Apple Bloom!?\nApple Bloom: Zecora! I think I found all the things ya asked for. What in Ponyville is goin' on here?\nApplejack: [gasp] Apple Bloom! You're okay!\nApple Bloom: Why wouldn't I be?\nTwilight Sparkle: Because Zecora is an evil enchantress who cursed us and was gonna cook you up into soup!\nZecora and Apple Bloom: [laughs]\nApple Bloom: Oh Twilight. Did those silly fillies finally get in yer head? You know there's no such thing as a curse.\nTwilight Sparkle: Apple Bloom, sweetie. You can't just stand there and tell me this isn't a curse.\nApple Bloom: This isn't a curse.\nZecora: If you will remember back, the words I spoke were quite exact. [flashback] Beware, beware you pony folk. Those leaves of blue are not a joke.\nApple Bloom: It was a warnin'. About that blue plant. It's called Poison Joke.\nZecora: That plant is much like poison oak. But its results are like a joke.\nApplejack: What in the hay does that mean?\nZecora: It means this plant does not breed wrath. Instead this plant just wants a laugh.\nApplejack: Will somepony please talk normal?\nTwilight Sparkle: I think what she's saying is that when we ran in to save Apple Bloom, we ran into the poison joke. All our problems are just little jokes it played on us.\nApplejack: Little jokes?! Very funny.\nRainbow Dash: Okay, fine. But what about the cauldron?\nFluttershy: And the chanting?\nRarity: And the creepy d\u00e9cor?\nZecora: Treasures of the native land where I am from. This one speaks 'hello', and this 'welcome'.\nRarity: Not welcoming at all, if you ask me.\nZecora: The words I chanted were from olden times. Something you call a nursery rhyme.\nTwilight Sparkle: But the cauldron... The Apple Bloom soup?\nApple Bloom: Lookie here Twilight. That pot of water wasn't for me, it was for all these herbal ingredients. The cure for poison joke is a simple old-natural remedy. You just gotta take a bubble bath!\nTwilight Sparkle: But I tried to find a cure in all my books and couldn't find anything. What book has this natural remedy?\nZecora: Here is the book, you see? Sad that you lack it in your library.\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, I do have this book, but I didn't look inside because the title was so... Weird. Supernaturals: Natural Remedies and Cure-alls That Are Simply Super. I...I... I'm so sorry, Zecora. I had the answer the whole time, if only I had bothered to look inside.\nZecora: [chuckle] Maybe next time you will take a second look, and not judge the cover of the book.\nApple Bloom: Hahaha.\nTwilight Sparkle: Zecora? Would you be kind enough to mix up another batch of the herbal bath?\nZecora: Mix it up I certainly will. Yet I am missing an herb from Ponyville.\nApple Bloom: But whenever Zecora comes to town, all the shops are mysteriously closed.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, well... I think we can help you with that.\n\nDaisy: Look Rose! How awful!\nRose: The wicked enchantress has cursed them all.\nLily Valley: The horror, the horror!\n[Ponies panicking]\nDaisy: Run, ponies! Run!\nTwilight Sparkle: Daisy, we need to talk.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Dear Princess Celestia,\nMy friends and I all learned an important lesson this week: Never judge a book by its cover. Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary. But you have to look past that and learn who they are inside. Real friends don't care what your \"cover\" is; it's the \"contents\" of a pony that count. And a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever.\n\nYour faithful student,\nTwilight Sparkle\n\nLotus Blossom: Miss Zecora, I would love to get the recipe for this bath. It's simply luxurious!\nApple Bloom: Applejack! Hey, where's Applejack?!\nPonies: [gasp]\nApplejack: [normal voice] I'm right here, little sis. I ain't tiny no more!\nRarity: Oh! I have never felt so lovely in all my life!\nPinkie Pie: Oh, my gosh! I never realized how horrible it is not to be able to talk. I mean, I love talking so much, and when I couldn't talk anymore, my tongue was all 'ehhhh'! It was the worst! Don't you agree, Fluttershy?\nFluttershy: [normal voice] ... Yes.\nEveryone: [laughing]\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nFluttershy: La, la la, la la, la la, la la. Thank you little squirrel, but remember: these flowers are for Princess Celestia. Only the prettiest ones will do.

I've never seen anything like you before.\nParasprite: [sniff]\nFluttershy: Oh, are you hungry? Here you go. [gasp] I guess you were hungry.\nParasprite: [purr]\nFluttershy: You're the cutest thing ever! I can't wait to show you to my friends.\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh! Hurry up, Spike! This place isn't gonna clean itself.\nSpike: It also didn't mess itself up.\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow!\nSpike: I thought this was just an unofficial casual visit.\nTwilight Sparkle: There's nothing casual about a visit from royalty. I want this place to be spotless, and you've barely made a dent in the clutter.\nSpike: Maybe you should, ugh, start reading them one at a time-- whoa ho! Aw.\nTwilight Sparkle: Everything's got to be perfect. No time for fooling around.\nSpike: You know, this would be an awful lot easier if there weren't two of us here getting under each other's feet.\nTwilight Sparkle: Great idea. You clean, I'll go see how everyone else's preparations are coming.\nSpike: Or maybe I should... [groan]\n\n[ponies chatter]\nTwilight Sparkle: What happened to the rest of her name?\nGolden Harvest: We couldn't fit it all in.\nTwilight Sparkle: You can't hang a banner that says \"Welcome Princess Celest\". Take it down and try again.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: That looks perfect. Keep up the good work.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. How's the banquet coming?\nMrs. Cake: Uh...it would be coming a little better if...\nPinkie Pie: Mmm... [slurp]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie! What are you doing? Those sweets are supposed to be for the princess.\nPinkie Pie: I know. That's why I'm tasting them. Somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue, and I, Pinkie Pie, declare that these treats are fit for a king, or a queen, or a princess.\nFluttershy: Twilight, Pinkie, you won't believe... oh, I'm sorry. Uh, am I interrupting?\nPinkie Pie: No, not at all. Come on in and make yourself at home. [slurp] What's going on, Fluttershy?\nFluttershy: You won't believe what I found at the edge of the Everfree Forest. Come on out, little guy. It's okay.\nParasprite: [purr] [chirp]\nFluttershy: [gasp] Three?\nTwilight Sparkle: They're amazing. What are they?\nFluttershy: I'm not sure. I'm also not sure where these other two came from.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'll take one off your hooves. I've never seen anything so... adorable. Besides, it'll be nice to have a companion for Spike so he won't bother me so much while I'm studying.\nFluttershy: Pinkie, do you want the other one?\nPinkie Pie: Ugh! A parasprite? Are you kidding?\nFluttershy: Ugh?\nTwilight Sparkle: A para-what?\nFluttershy: How could you not like...\nPinkie Pie: Ugh. Now I gotta go find a trombone.\nTwilight Sparkle: A what?\nPinkie Pie: A trombone, you know: [trombone imitation]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ahhh, typical Pinkie.\nParasprite: [purr]\n\nRarity: Stand still, Rainbow Dash.\nRainbow Dash: Ugh, I caaan't, I need to flyyy! This is waaay too boring for me.\nRarity: Do you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not?\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow. Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous.\nRarity: Mmhmm. Thank you, Twilight. Nice to know someone appreciates my talents.\nRainbow Dash: Ugh, sooo boooring.\nParasprites: [chirp]\nRarity: Huh?\nRainbow Dash: What's that sound, Twilight?\nParasprite: [several chirps]\nRainbow Dash: Wow, what are they?\nTwilight Sparkle: The better question is, where did they come from? I only had one a minute ago.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, I'll take one.\nRarity: Me too. Oh, they're perfect.\nPinkie Pie: Does anypony know where I can find an accordion?\nTwilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity: [baby talk]\nPinkie Pie: Girls! Hello! This is important. Durgh! Thanks a lot.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [sigh] The decorations, the banquet, I really hope everything comes together in time for tomorrow.\nSpike and Parasprite: [snoring]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, [yawn] what's there to worry about?\n\nParasprites: [snoring]\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike! Wake up! What happened?\nSpike: Huh? Whaaa! What's going on?\nParasprite: [chirp]\nTwilight Sparkle: Where did they come from?\nSpike: I don't know. The little guy got hungry in the night, so I gave him a snack, but... I have no idea where these others came from. Oh no! They're messing up all my hard work!\nTwilight Sparkle: The princess will be here in a few hours.\nSpike: Ugh.\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, help me round up these little guys.\nSpike: Ugh, what does it look like I'm doin'? Ooow, waaah! D'oh. I know, I know, \"stop fooling around\".\n\nParasprite: [several chirps]\nRainbow Dash: Huh? Huh?! [screams] [grunting] Get off me! [grunting] Waaa!\n\nRarity: Not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful.\nParasprite: [purr] [grunt]\nRarity: Oh! Are you okay? Aaah! [gasp] Eewww. Aaah! Gross gross gross! No creature that behaves so revoltingly is allowed in my boutique!\nParasprite: [grunt] [pop]\nRarity: [screams]\n\nPinkie Pie: Look Rarity, Applejack loaned me a harmonica. [plays harmonica] Isn't that great?\nParasprites: [chirping]\nPinkie Pie: [gasp] And not a moment too soon.\nRarity: Ugh, Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now.\nPinkie Pie: And I'm not? You know how many more instruments I've gotta find? A lot, that's how many. Now if we split the list between us, we might just make it in time.\nRarity: Please, Pinkie, I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt. I've got a real problem.\nPinkie Pie: You've got a real problem, all right. And a banjo is the only answer!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp]\nRarity: [gasp] I see we're having the same problem.\nRainbow Dash: Ditto!\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy knows everything about animals, I'm sure she can tell us how to stop them from multiplying.\nParasprites: [chirp]\nTwilight Sparkle: ...or not.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh, do something Fluttershy, can't you control them?\nFluttershy: I've tried everything I know. I've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching, and asking politely, and...\nRainbow Dash: Guh... [moans]\n\nPrincess Celestia: [scream]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: If we can't get them under control before the princess arrives, it'll be a total disaster.\nParasprite: [hack]\nRarity: Ew! If you ask me, it's already a total disaster.\nApplejack: Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy, but I still can't figure why y'need so many. Hey!\nFluttershy: What do we do?\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp] I got it! Nopony can herd like Applejack.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! We can drive 'em back into the forest.\nApplejack: [scoffs] I'll rastle 'em up, but I need everypony's help to do it. Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there. I'll herd the little critters straight at ya like a funnel. Rainbow Dash, you and Fluttershy stay on top of 'em, don't let 'em fly away.\nRainbow Dash: Aye aye.\nApplejack: Yeeeeeee-haw!\nParasprite: [screech]\nApplejack: Alright y'all, here goes nothin'. Look out Rarity, that one's fixin' to get away. Keep a lead on 'em, Rainbow Dash! Hold on girls, we're almost there.\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie: Twilight, we don't have much time.\nTwilight Sparkle: You're telling me. The princess could arrive at any moment.\nPinkie Pie: Exactly. That's why I need you gals to drop what you're doing and help me find some maracas.\nTwilight Sparkle: Maracas? Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas.\nPinkie Pie: [gasp] You're right! Getting a tuba has to be our number one goal. Follow me. I said, follow me!\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie Pie, you are so random.\nPinkie Pie: And you are all so stubborn!\nApplejack: Forget her ladies. Focus. Head 'em up and move 'em out.\nRainbow Dash: All right! [grunt]\nFluttershy: Ouch.\nTwilight Sparkle: We did it. Nice work, Applejack.\nApplejack: Couldn't a'done it without y'all.\nTwilight Sparkle: Now let's get back and clean up the mess they made before the princess arrives.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, everyone knows what to do, right? We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time.\nFluttershy: [gasps]\nTwilight Sparkle: Where did they come from?\nFluttershy: Well, I may have kept just one. Heh. I couldn't help myself. They're just so cute.\nTwilight Sparkle: We don't have time to keep rounding up these things. What do we do now?\nRainbow Dash: We call in the weather patrol. [grunts]\nRarity: [yelp]\nRainbow Dash: Time to take out the adorable trash. YAAAAAA!\nParasprites: [chirp]\nTwilight Sparkle: [grunt] Way to go, Rainbow Dash!\nApplejack: Looks like our problems are solved.\nPinkie Pie: They will be with these cymbals.\n[cymbals crashing]\nPinkie Pie: Hey! Give me those back!\nRainbow Dash: Whoa. Yaa! Yow! Whoa! Wow! I can't hold it! She's breaking up.\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, what have you done?\nPinkie Pie: I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals, that's what I've done.\nTwilight Sparkle: Will you forget about your silly instruments for one second? You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville.\nPinkie Pie: Me? Ruin? I'm not the ruiner, I'm the ruin-ee! Or is it ruiness? Ruinette?\nApplejack: Come on girls, there's no reasoning with that one. She's a few apples short of a bushel.\nPinkie Pie: Hey! I'm trying to tell you all that the ruining is on the other hoof. If you'd just slow down and listen to me!\n\nParasprites: [chirps] [munch] [munch]\nPony: [gasp]\nGardening pony: Aah!\nFluttershy: What do we do? They're eating all the food in town.\nApplejack: [gasp] My apples!\nTwilight Sparkle: We've gotta do something. [gasps] I got it! I'll cast a spell to make them stop eating all the food.\nPinkie Pie: Look, tambourines! If you could all just... [scream] [tambourines shake]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp]\nParasprite: [chirp]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sigh]\nParasprite: [munch]\nRainbow Dash: Heh. Hey, it worked. They're not eating the food anymore.\nRarity: Oh no... if they get inside my store... Everypony for herself!\n\nRarity: My outfits! Go on, shoo! Get out of here, you naughty! Naughty! [shrieks]\nPinkie Pie: I'll save you!\n[recorder]\nRarity: [shriek]\n\nApplejack: No woodland creature's gonna eat the Apple Family's crop.\n[parasprites buzzing]\nApplejack: Brace yourself, y'all, here they come!\n[crash]\nApplejack: [gasp] Didn't see that one comin'.\n\nSpike: Help!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp] They're eating the words! [grunts]\nSpike: Help...\n\n[crash]\nZecora: Ugh. Have you gone mad?\nTwilight Sparkle: Zecora, these little guys are devouring Ponyville, and the princess is on her way. Can you help us, please?\nZecora: Oh, monster of so little size. Is that a parasprite before my eyes?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know! Is it?\nZecora: Tales of crops and harvests consumed. If these creatures are in Ponyville, you're doomed.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gulp]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [grunts] Oh no, here she comes.\n[ponies scream]\nDaisy: Aaaah, aaaaaaah!\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, here's the plan. Rainbow Dash, you distract them.\nRainbow Dash: YAAAA!\nTwilight Sparkle: Good. Everyone else, we need to build an exact copy of Ponyville right over there. We've got less than a minute. Zecora was right, we're doomed. Oh no, the princess's procession is here. It's all over!\n[polka music]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie? We're in the middle of a crisis here.

Hit much traffic?\nPrincess Celestia: Ah, what is this? Oh ho ho, these creatures are adorable.\nRainbow Dash: They're not that adorable.\nPrincess Celestia: I'm terribly honored that you and the good citizens of Ponyville have organized a parade in honor of my visit.\nTwilight Sparkle: Parade? Oh. Yes, the parade.\nPrincess Celestia: Unfortunately, that visit is going to have to wait for another time. I'm afraid an emergency has come up in Fillydelphia. Apparently there's been some sort of infestation.\nTwilight Sparkle: An... infestation?\nPrincess Celestia: Yes, a swarm of incredibly bothersome creatures has invaded the poor town. I'm sorry Twilight, to have to put you all through so much trouble.\nTwilight Sparkle: Trouble? What trouble?\nPrincess Celestia: Before I have to go, would you care to give me your latest report on the magic of friendship in person?\nTwilight Sparkle: My... report?\nPrincess Celestia: Haven't you learned anything about friendship?\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, I have. I've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least expect it. It's a good idea to stop and listen to your friends' opinions and perspectives...\n[cymbals crash]\nTwilight Sparkle: Even when they don't always seem to make sense.\nPrincess Celestia: I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle, and I'm very impressed with your friends as well. It sounds like you're all learning so much from each other.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you, princess.\nPinkie Pie: Hey, what happened to the princess?\nTwilight Sparkle: Emergency in Fillydelphia.\nRainbow Dash: Some sort of infestation.\nPinkie Pie: Oh no! Have they got parasprites too? Well, have tuba, will travel.\nTwilight Sparkle: I think the princess can handle it.\nApplejack: So you knew what those critters were all along, huh Pinkie Pie?\nPinkie Pie: Well, duh! Why do you think I was so frantic to get my hooves on all these instruments? I tried to tell you.\nTwilight Sparkle: We know, Pinkie Pie, and we're sorry we didn't listen.\nRainbow Dash, Rarity, Fluttershy, and Applejack: [apologies]\nTwilight Sparkle: You're a great friend, even if we don't always understand you.\nPinkie Pie: Thanks guys, you're all great friends too, even when I don't understand me.\nTwilight Sparkle: You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia, and more importantly, you saved Ponyville.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: ...Or not.\n[sad trombone]\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[crickets]\nSpike: [snore]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp] Spike, wake up.

Now help me get ready.\nSpike: Clean up winter? Who cleans up winter? Don't they just use magic to change the seasons like they do in Canterlot?\nTwilight Sparkle: No Spike, Ponyville was started by Earth ponies, so for hundreds of years they've never used magic to clean up winter. It's traditional. [sigh]\nSpike: It's ridiculous. No magic...

No wings.\nRainbow Dash: Sorry, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp] Great, now what do we do?\nSpike: I don't know about you, but I'm gonna be nappin'.

When the weather team guides the birds back north for the spring, they'll need a place to live and lay their eggs.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow, Rarity, that one's really beautiful.\nRarity: Oh why, thank you most sincerely. Would you like to try your hoof at a nest?\nTwilight Sparkle: Would I? Yes! Where do I begin?\nRarity: Okay. Now... uh, take some of that straw and hay over there, and a little bit of branch. Now, weave them through there, yes. Uh, take some ribbon, yes, oh uh, n... not there, oooh, yes, uh, tuck it in over there, uh but be careful not to... I don't know I guess that would do... oh dear.\nTwilight Sparkle: There! It looks just like... yours. Oh my.\nSpike: That nest needs to be condemned.\nRarity: Oh, Spa-ha-hike, it's not so bad, ah, maybe birds can use it as a...\nSpike: An outhouse?\nRarity: Spike. It's just fine. It's just a little rough around the edges. Let me lend you a hoof. Let's just untie this ribbon, and let me take out these sticks here, we'll shave this...

Wheeeeeeee!\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow, Pinkie Pie, you're quite the skater. Probably the best skater I've ever seen.\nPinkie Pie: Thanks Twilight, I've been doing this since I was an itty-bitty little-wittle Twinkie-Pinkie. Just comes natural. Which is probably why they designated me the lake scorer. I cut lines in the lakes with my skates. That way, when the rest of the weather team comes here to break the ice, it'll be easy as pie.\nTwilight Sparkle: How clever. When the thick ice begins to melt, it'll break along the lines. Well, you sure have a lot of work ahead of you, there's quite a few lakes in Ponyville.\nPinkie Pie: Ha, tell me about it. Hey, Twilight, wanna help me out?\nTwilight Sparkle: Would I?\nPinkie Pie: Come on, put on those skates over there. I bet you'll be a natural too.\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay.\n\nPinkie Pie: Yaaaaay! [cheers]\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh... maybe on second thought.\nSpike: What are you talking about? You said you wanted to be helpful.\nPinkie Pie: Yippie!\nSpike: Now get out there.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh no, whoa, wow...\nPinkie Pie: Twilight, steer! Steer!\nTwilight Sparkle: Yaaaaa!\nPinkie Pie: Oh boy...\n[screams]\nSpike: Pwuh.\nPinkie Pie: [blips]\nSpike: Ha ha, you are a natural, Twilight. A natural disaster. [laughter]\nPinkie Pie: Twilight, you did a great job your first time around. I'm sure my first time was just as wobbly and bobbly and crasheriffic as yours.\nTwilight Sparkle: Really?\nPinkie Pie: No.\nSpike: [chuckles]\nPinkie Pie: But did I make you feel better?\nTwilight Sparkle: Mm-hmm, yeah, I guess.\nPinkie Pie: I think you'll be super awesome at something that keeps your hooves on the ground. I know, Fluttershy could probably use your help with the critters.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well... I'm pretty good with little animals. Yeah, I'll go help her.\nPinkie Pie: Uh... it's, ah, that a-way.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yaaaaaa!\nSpike: [chuckles]\n\nFluttershy: Wake up, little sleepy heads. Hope you had some wonderful dreams and restful hibernation, but it's time to get up now, spring is coming.\nHedgehogs: [yawn]\nTwilight Sparkle: Awww, how cute.\nFluttershy: Aren't they? This is my favorite task the whole season, when I get to see all my little animal friends again.\nSpike: Uh, what's \"hibernation\"?\nFluttershy: It's like a long sleep.\nSpike: Long sleep?\nFluttershy: Yes. [bell rings] Wake up, little porcupines. Animals often hibernate through the winter to save their energy and eat less food.\nSpike: I definitely like the idea of hibernation, uh, except for the \"eat less food\" part.\nPorcupines: [yawn] [yelp]\nFluttershy: Oh, would you just look at all these warrens and dens? I'm worried that I won't be able to wake up every animal before spring comes.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, I'll help, Fluttershy.\nFluttershy: You will? Oh, that would be wonderful.\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, let's start there.\n\n[bell rings]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hello? Wake up little friends, wherever you are. Spring is coming.

[grunt] [scream] Ugh!\nFluttershy: Good morning, friends.\nTwilight Sparkle: [groan]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [sigh] All this Winter Wrap Up stuff is a lot harder than it looks.\nSpike: [nasally] Right, because there's no magic. Why don't you just use magic, Twilight, and get it done the right way?\nTwilight Sparkle: No, Spike, I have to do it the traditional way. Ponyville has never needed magic to wrap up winter.\nSpike: [nasally] Well, they never had you here before, either. Think how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.\nTwilight Sparkle: No, no, no! I'm gonna find some other way that I can help out if it kills me. [grunt]\n\nApplejack: Keep pushin', Caramel. That's it, Bumpkin. I know it's hard work, but you guys are doin' great. Yee-haw!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey, Applejack. How's everything going?\nApplejack: Oh, just dandy. A little slow startin', but peachy all the same. There's a lot of ground to clear, ya hear? We can't even start the plantin' and the waterin' until we git all these heap a' snow hightailed outta here.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, I'd like to help.\nApplejack: Well, I... I dunno Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: Just give me a chance.\nApplejack: Well, I never turn down a hard worker, but...\nTwilight Sparkle: [struggle] Ugh... [struggle] Ugh... [gasp]\nSpike: Think of how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.\nTwilight Sparkle: I could use a come-to-life spell. Hwww... Here goes...\nApplejack: Hmm. She's awful strong for such a little pony.\nSpike: That's my girl, following my advice.\nApplejack: And what in tarnation does that mean?\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp] Uh-oh. Slow down. Slow down!\nSpike: [yelp]\nSpike and Applejack: Whoa-oa-oa!\nApplejack: What's going on? Wha'd'ya do? You used magic, didn't you?\n[crash]\n[rumbling]\nApplejack: Nuts, Twilight, you used magic!\nSpike: The nerve! Can you believe her?\nApplejack: That's not how we do it around here, Twilight, and especially not on my farm!\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, see, I just wanted to... [whine]\n\nSpike: Come on, Twilight. Come on out.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm a winter mess up.\nSpike: Well you're good at a lot of things, just not nest-making, ice-skating, animal-waking, snow-clearing.\nTwilight Sparkle: [whine] Thanks a lot for making me feel so much better.\nSpike: That's what I'm here for, sister.\nApplejack: Rainbow Dash, y'all on the weather team need to melt the rest of the snow here on the ground and the trees, pronto.\nRainbow Dash: Got it.\nFluttershy: Wait. My poor little animals' homes will get flooded if the snow melts too fast.\nRainbow Dash: Got it.\nApplejack: I'm tellin' you, Rainbow, you gotta melt that snow now.\nFluttershy: No, you simply must wait.\nRainbow Dash: Okay.\nApplejack: Go.\nFluttershy: Stop.\nApplejack: Go.\nFluttershy: Stop.\nApplejack: GO!\nFluttershy: STOP!\nRainbow Dash: Ugh! Make up your minds!\nMayor Mare: Oh! What in Equestria are all you arguing about? This sort of silliness is why we were late for spring last year, and the year before that, and the year before that.\nTwilight Sparkle: Did she say late?\nMayor Mare: I was hoping my amazingly inspirational speech would urge everyone to do better than last year, but now it looks like we're going to be later than ever. I mean just look at this catastrophe! The ice scorers made the ice chunks too big to melt. The nest designer is horrendously behind. We need several hundred, and she's only made one!\nRarity: [sob]\nMayor Mare: And don't get me started on all the clouds in the sky, the icicles on the trees... this isn't good, not at all!\nApplejack: And it's gonna be all to pieces disastrous if we can't get our seeds all planted.\nRainbow Dash: Chillax Applejack, we're bustin' our chops as fast as we can.\nFluttershy: No, not fast. We have to wake animals slowly.\nBig McIntosh: Uh, AJ?\nApplejack: Oh good gravy, Caramel lost the grass seeds again, didn't he?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nCaramel: [whimpers]\nRainbowshine: [grunt] Ditzy Doo accidentally went north to get the southern birds!\nRainbow Dash: Oh that featherbrain. Didn't she learn her lesson last year when she went west?\n[ponies grumble and complain]\nMayor Mare: Stop this at once. We don't have time to argue. It's almost sundown.

Like all ponies, I wasn't born with a cutie mark. My flank was blank.\nTwist: Aww...! She's so precious!\nCheerilee: Then one day, when I was about your age, I woke up to find that a cutie mark had appeared.\n[offscreen: Look at her hair!]\nCheerilee: Yes I know, but honestly, that's how everypony was wearing their mane back then. I had decided to become a teacher, and the flowers symbolized my hope that I could help my future students bloom if I nurture them with knowledge. The smiles represented the cheer I hope to bring to my little ponies while they were learning. Now, can anyone tell me when a pony gets his or her cutie mark?\nTwist: Oh! Oh! Oh! When she discovers that certain something that makes her special!\nCheerilee: That's right, Twist. A cutie mark appears on a pony's flank when he or she finds that certain something that makes them different from every other pony. Discovering what makes you unique isn't something [Diamond Tiara: Pssst!] that happens overnight, and no amount of hoping, wishing, [Diamond Tiara: Pssst!] or begging, would make a cutie mark appear before its time.\nDiamond Tiara: Pssst!\nApple Bloom: What?!\nCheerilee: Apple Bloom!

If I buy some apples, will you please leave me alone?\nApple Bloom: All right!\nApplejack: You forgot your change!\nApple Bloom: Woo-hoo! That's how you sell s'm apples and get a cutie mark!

You're still gonna come to the party, are you?\nDiamond Tiara: Of course she will.\nSilver Spoon: It's not like being the only pony there without a cutie mark would be, like, the most embarrassing thing ever. [laughter]\n\nRainbow Dash: Whoa, looks like somepony's got a dark cloud hanging over her head. Let me do something about that. What's the matter, kid?\nApple Bloom: [inhales] There's a cute-cea\u00f1era this afternoon and everypony in my class will be there and they'll all have their cutie marks and I wanna get my cutie mark but I'm no good at sellin' apples but I really wanna go to the party but how can I go to the party if I don't have my cutie mark which my big sister says I'm gonna get eventually but... I WANT IT NOW!\nRainbow Dash: Cutie mark? I can get you a cutie mark like that! [snap]\nApple Bloom: Applejack says these things take time. I have to just wait for it to happen.\nRainbow Dash: Why wait for something to happen when you can make it happen?\nApple Bloom: But Applejack says th...\nRainbow Dash: Hey, who are you gonna listen to, Applejack, or the pony who was first in her class to get a cutie mark? I always liked flying an' all, but I was going nowhere in a hurry. It wasn't until my very first race that I discovered a serious need for speed, and KAZAM, this sweet baby appeared as fast as lightning.\n\nRainbow Dash: That's right, stretch out those legs. Gotta be nice and loose. The key here is to try as many things as possible as quickly as possible. One of them is bound to lead to your cutie mark. Are you ready?\nApple Bloom: I'm ready!\nRainbow Dash: I said: Are! You! Ready!\nApple Bloom: I'M READY!\nRainbow Dash: Juggling, go! [whistle blows]\nApple Bloom: Ah!\nRainbow Dash: Hang-gliding, go! [whistle blows]\nApple Bloom: Whoa!\nRainbow Dash: Karate, go! [whistle blows]\nApple Bloom: Hi-ya! Ee...\nRainbow Dash: Kite-flying, go! [whistle blows]\nRainbow Dash: Ultrapony Roller Derby, go! [whistle blows]\nRoller ponies: [growl]\nApple Bloom: Whoaaa! Whoa...\n\nRainbow Dash: Tried that one... tried that one... tried that one...\nSilver Spoon: Your new outfit is, like, perfect for the party.\nDiamond Tiara: I know. It totally shows off my cutie mark.\nSilver Spoon: I love being special.\nDiamond Tiara: Can you imagine how embarrassing it must be to be... not special?\nSilver Spoon: I don't even want to, like, think about it.\nRainbow Dash: Tried that one... tried that one...\nApple Bloom: I'm doomed. Doomed! I'll never find sumth'n I'm good at.\nPinkie Pie: You look like you'd be good at eating cupcakes.\nApple Bloom: Eatin' cupcakes?\nRainbow Dash: Eating cupcakes?\nPinkie Pie: Eating cupcaaakes!\nApple Bloom: I really appreciate all your help, Rainbow Dash. You're a really great coach and I really learned a lot from you and I'm sure I can learn a lot more but... I've got some cupcakes to eat! See you at the cute-cea\u00f1era! Hold on, Pinkie Pie, I'm comin'.\n\nApple Bloom: I can't believe I didn't think of this. A cupcake-eating cutie mark, it's sooo obvious. Now, where are those cupcakes? I'm ready t' chow down!\nPinkie Pie: I don't have any cupcakes.\nApple Bloom: Oh.\nPinkie Pie: [gasp] But you look like you'd be good at helping me make some.\nApple Bloom: I guess, uh, making-cupcakes cutie mark could work too.\n\n[Pinkie Pie]\nAll you have to do is take a cup of flour\nAdd it to the mix\nNow just take a little something sweet, not sour\nA bit of salt, just a pinch\n\nAll you have to do is take a cup of flour\nAdd it to the mix\nNow just take a little something sweet, not sour\nA bit of salt, just a pinch\n\nBaking these treats is such a cinch\nAdd a teaspoon of vanilla\nAdd a little more, and you count to four,\nAnd you never get your fill of...\n\nBaking these treats is such a cinch\nAdd a teaspoon of vanilla\nAdd a little more, and you count to four,\nAnd you never get your fill of...\n\nCupcakes! So sweet and tasty\nCupcakes! Don't be too hasty\nCupcakes! Cupcakes, cupcakes, CUPCAKES!\nApple Bloom: [cough] Hot, hot, hot!\nPinkie Pie: Oooh, those look much better than the last batch. [chomp] Mmm...\nApple Bloom: Ugh! I guess I'm not cut out to be a baker either. [sigh] I just have to face it, I'm gonna have a blank flank forever.\nPinkie Pie: What about that?\nApple Bloom: What about what? Is there something on my flank? Is there, is there, is there? [gasp] A cutie mark! It's a... a measuring cup? No. A mixin' bowl? No... Are those cupcakes? A tower of cupcakes maybe.\nPinkie Pie: [blow] Flour. It's flour! Yay! I guessed it. What game you wanna play next? Please say bingo, please say bingo.\nTwilight Sparkle: Whoa, what's been going on in here?\nPinkie Pie: We've been making cupcakes, wanna try them?\nTwilight Sparkle: Nnnno thank you... not that they don't look, heh, delicious.\nApple Bloom: Twilight, you have to help me!\nTwilight Sparkle: What's the matter?\nApple Bloom: [inhales] Tiara's cute-cea\u00f1era's today and everypony in my class will be there and they'll all have their cutie marks and I want to get my cutie mark but I'm no good at selling apples or hang-gliding or making cupcakes, but I wanna go to the party but how can I go to the party if I don't have my cutie mark, which Pinkie Pie says I can't just make appear, but I need it to appear, right now!\nTwilight Sparkle: Uhhh... I don't follow. How can I help you?\nApple Bloom: You can use your magic to make my cutie mark appear.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh no, Apple Bloom. A cutie mark is something a pony has to discover for herself.\nApple Bloom: Please Twilight, jus' trah.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sorry, but-\nApple Bloom: Oh please, please, please please please!\nTwilight Sparkle: All right, all right!\nApple Bloom: Oh thank you thank you thank you. [pwing] Yes! I knew you could do... it.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sorry, sweetie, but I told you-\nApple Bloom: Try again, try again!\nTwilight Sparkle: [sigh]\n[pwing] [pwang] [pwing] [pweng] [pwung] [pwing] [pwung] [pwong] [pwing] [pwing] [pwung] [pwing]\nApple Bloom: [gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: Told you that not even magic can make a cutie mark appear before its time.\nApple Bloom: It's hopeless, hopeless! I just won't go to the party, I can't go. Everyone will just laugh at me and make fun of me and call me names. It will be the worst night of my life.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sure it won't be as bad as all that.\nApple Bloom: Forget it, there's no way I'm going to that [gulp] party.\n\nCupcakes! So sweet and tasty\nCupcakes! Don't be too hasty\nCupcakes! Cupcakes, cupcakes, CUPCAKES!\n\n[ponies chatter]\nApple Bloom: How could I have forgotten the time? How could I have forgotten Pinkie Pie was hosting the party? How could I have forgotten it was at Sugarcube Corner?\nPinkie Pie: Don't forget your party hat, Forgetty Forgetterson!\nApple Bloom: I have to get out of here before anypony sees me.\nSnails: [chomp]\nDiamond Tiara: Hey! It's my cute-cea\u00f1era, I'm supposed to get the first bite at cake.\n[pop] [pop] [pop] [pop] [pop] [pop]\nApple Bloom: Okay, Apple Bloom, almost there.\nApplejack: Apple Bloom, you made it. After I heard about Twist, I was afraid you wouldn't show up. I sure am glad you came to your senses about this whole cutie mark thing. These things happen when these things are supposed to happen. Trying to rush 'em just drives you crazy. I'll let you be, looks like your friends want to talk to you.\nApple Bloom: [grunt]\nDiamond Tiara: Well well well, look who's here.\nSilver Spoon: Nice outfit.\nApple Bloom: Just sumt'n I, uh, pulled together last minute.\nDiamond Tiara: It really shows off your cutie mark. Oh wait, that's right, you don't have one.\nApple Bloom: Uh, I have a cutie mark.\nSilver Spoon: Eh, what? Since when?\nApple Bloom: Since... Um... Earlier today.\nDiamond Tiara: Oh really? Let's see it.\nApple Bloom: I shouldn't. I couldn't. My cutie mark is so unbelievably amazing, I'm afraid that if I show it off, everyone will start paying attention to me instead of you. Outshined at your own cute-cea\u00f1era. Can you imagine how embarrassing that would be?\nDiamond Tiara: Uh, forget it, I didn't really want to see it anyway.\nApple Bloom: Okay, well, I'm gonna go mingle. Enjoy your party. [sigh]\n[record scratch]\n[everyone gasps]\nApple Bloom: Oh no.\nSilver Spoon: Wow, that is an amazing cutie mark.\nDiamond Tiara: Nice try...\nDiamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: Blank flank!\nScootaloo: [offscreen] You got a problem with blank flanks?\n[fillies gasp]\nScootaloo: I said, you got a problem with blank flanks?\nSilver Spoon: The problem is, I mean, she's like, totally not special.\nSweetie Belle: No, it means she's full of potential.\nScootaloo: It means she could be great at anything. The possibilities are, [mocking] like, endless.\nSweetie Belle: She could be a great scientist, or an amazing artist, or a famous writer. She could even be mayor of Ponyville someday.\nScootaloo: And she's not stuck being stuck-up like you two.\n[ponies laugh]\nDiamond Tiara: Hey, this is my party, why are you two on her side?\nScootaloo: Because...\nApple Bloom: [gasp] You don't have your cutie marks either? I thought I was the only one.\nScootaloo: We thought we were the only two.\nTwilight Sparkle: I for one think you are three very lucky fillies.\nDiamond Tiara: Lucky? How can they be lucky?\nTwilight Sparkle: They still get to experience the thrill of discovering who they are, and what they're meant to be.\nApplejack: And they got all the time in the world to figure it out, not just an afternoon.\n[ponies chatter]\n\"Tornado Bolt\": Wow, Apple Bloom, I wish I could be a scientist.\n\"Pi\u00f1a Colada\": Do you really think you could be mayor?\n\"Coronet\": Maybe I got my cutie mark too soon.\nDiamond Tiara: Hey, what's everypony doing? This is my party, everypony is supposed to be paying attention to me.\nSilver Spoon: Whatever. We still think you're losers, right, Diamond Tiara? Bump, bump, sugar... lump...\nDiamond Tiara: Not now, Silver Spoon.\nScootaloo: Name's Scootaloo.\nSweetie Belle: And I'm Sweetie Belle.\nApple Bloom: Apple Bloom.\n\n[music]\nTwist: This song is so super!\nApple Bloom: So I was thinking, now that we're friends... I mean, we are friends, right?\nScootaloo: How could we not be? We're totally alike. We don't have cutie marks, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon drive us crazy--\nSweetie Belle: Totally crazy.\nApple Bloom: Well, now that we're friends, what if the three of us work together to find out who we are and what we're supposed to be?\nSweetie Belle: Ooh! Ooh! We could form our own secret society.\nScootaloo: I'm liking this idea.\nApple Bloom: A secret society. Yeah. We need a name for it though.\nScootaloo: The Cutie Mark Three?\nSweetie Belle: The Cutastically Fantastics?\nApple Bloom: How about... The Cutie Mark Crusaders?\nScootaloo: It's perfect!\nSweetie Belle: This is gonna be so great!\nApple Bloom: We're gonna be unstoppable!\nScootaloo: What do you say we celebrate with some of these delicious cupcakes?\nApple Bloom: Not the cupcakes. Trust me.\nSweetie Belle: Let's see if there are any cookies.\nApple Bloom: Yeah! Come on.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Dearest Princess Celestia,\nI am happy to report that one of your youngest subjects has learned a valuable lesson about friendship. Sometimes, the thing you think will cause you to lose friends and feel left out...\nPrincess Celestia: ...can actually be the thing that helps you make your closest friends and realize how special you are. Hmm...\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nRainbow Dash: [grunt] Whoo-hoo!\nApplejack: Hoo-wee! Not a bad pitch for a pony who works with her head in the clouds.\nRainbow Dash: Oh yeah? Think you can do better, cowgirl?\nApplejack: I know I can. [grunt] Oh, for Pete's sake!\nRainbow Dash: Heh! Looks like this Pegasus can pitch better than the workhorse. The object of the game is to get the closest to the stake.\nApplejack: All right, all right. You got another throw there, pony girl.\nRainbow Dash: [grunt]\nApplejack: [sarcastically] Wow, Rainbow, heh. You couldn't hit a barn door with that kind of a throw!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, yeah. I still have the closest throw, Applesmack. Just try and beat it.\nApplejack: [grunt] Yee-haw! It's a ringer. That's how you do it down here on the farm.\nRainbow Dash: I lost.\nApplejack: Ah, don't feel bad, Rainbow. It's all in good fun.\nRainbow Dash: I hate losing.\nApplejack: Besides, you're a mighty good athlete. I'm just better. Heh heh heh.\nRainbow Dash: All right, Applejack, you think you're the top athlete in all of Ponyville?\nApplejack: Well, I was gonna say in all of Equestria, but that might be gildin' the lily.\nRainbow Dash: ...and I think I'm the top athlete. So let's prove it.\nApplejack: Prove what?\nRainbow Dash: I challenge you to an Iron Pony competition. A series of athletic contests to decide who's the best, once and for all.\nApplejack: You know what, Rainbow? You're on.\n\n[theme song]\n\nRainbow Dash: [grunt]\nTwilight Sparkle: So you two are doing what, now?\nApplejack: An Iron\u2014\nRainbow Dash: Iron Pony competition.\nApplejack: See, we've set up a bunch of events to decide which one of us is\u2014\nRainbow Dash: The most athletic pony ever! [grunt]\nTwilight Sparkle: And I'm here to...?\nRainbow Dash: [grunt] I don't know. Why is she here?\nApplejack: To be our judge and keep score.\nRainbow Dash: Right, heh. Somepony's gotta record my awesomeness for the history books. [grunt]\n\nSpike: Hello everypony, and welcome to the first annual Iron Pony competition!\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, Spike, who are you talking to?\nSpike: Um... uh, them! Let the games begin!\nMain cast sans Twilight: [cheer]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Ready. Set. Go!\nApplejack: [gasp] Dagnabbit.\nTwilight Sparkle: Time, Spike?\nSpike: 17 seconds.\nApplejack: You're kiddin'! That breaks my record from last year's rodeo.\nSpike: But you got a five second penalty for nudging the barrel.\nApplejack: [sigh] Nuts and chews! Still, that's twenty-two seconds. Not too shabby. Hey, don't be nervous. Remember, it's all in good fun. Now git on up there.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ready. Set. Go!\nApplejack: Woo! That was some fancy hoofwork there, Rainbow!\nRainbow Dash: Thanks, but I [pant] couldn't have been as fast as you.\nApplejack: What was the time on that, Spike?\nSpike: 18 seconds!\nApplejack: 18 seconds. Rainbow, are you sure you're not secretly a rodeo pony?\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash wins the barrel lead!\nRainbow Dash: Oh, I can't believe I won.\nApplejack: Yeah, well, don't you go gettin' used to it.\n\n[bell rings]\n[ponies cheer]\nApplejack: Mighty respectable, [spit] but let me show ya how it's really done.

You can't use your wings to help you win.\nRainbow Dash: [muffled] Huh?\nApplejack: [muffled] You're cheatin'!\nRainbow Dash: [muffled] I can't understand you with that rope in your mouth.\nApplejack: [spits] I said... uh-oh.

[chuckles] I am the Iron Pony!\nApplejack: Only 'cause you cheated!\nRainbow Dash: What?\nApplejack: You used your wingpower to help you win over half those contests!\nRainbow Dash: Sounds like sour apples to me.\nApplejack: Are you sayin' you didn't use your wings?\nRainbow Dash: Well... no. But you never said I couldn't use my wings.\nApplejack: I didn't think I needed to tell you to play fair.\nRainbow Dash: I still would have won even without my wings.\nApplejack: Hah! Prove it.\nRainbow Dash: Gladly. How?\nApplejack: Tomorrow is the annual Runnin' of the Leaves. I challenge you to race me in it.\nRainbow Dash: Heh! Easy shmeasy.\nApplejack: Hold on! There is one condition: the point is to run, so no wings allowed.\nRainbow Dash: No wings? No problem.\nApplejack: [spits]\nRainbow Dash: [spits] [blows raspberry]\nApplejack: [chuckle]\n\nSpike: Twilight, hurry up, we're gonna be late for the race.\nTwilight Sparkle: Why are you so excited about the race? It's only for ponies.\nSpike: Yeah, but I'm hoping I can be the announcer again. Just listen: fillies and gentlecolts, welcome to the annual Running of the--\nPinkie Pie: Welcome to the annual Running of the Leaves! This is Pinkie Pie, your official p-eye-in-the-sky announcer.\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry, Spike. I guess that job's already taken.\nPinkie Pie: As everypony knows, the Running is a very important tradition, for without it, the autumn leaves of Equestria would never fall. So get ready, ponies. The Running of the Leaves will begin in five minutes.\nApplejack: [grunts]\nRainbow Dash: Pardon me, excuse me. Make way for the Iron Pony.\nApplejack: The Iron Phony, you mean.\nRainbow Dash: So, Applejack, you ready to win second place?\nApplejack: I'm ready to run a good, clean race.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, yeah...\nApplejack: You are not allowed to use your wings.\nRainbow Dash: I could win this race with both wings tied behind my back.\n\nApplejack: [grunts] Trussed up like a turkey. Well, a turkey who can't fly, that is.\nRainbow Dash: Very funny.\nApplejack: 'Least now we know we're racin' fair and square.\n[trumpets]\nPinkie Pie: Racers! Please take your positions!\nSpike: Um... Pinkie Pie?\nPinkie Pie: Hey, Spike! What's up? Oh wait, it's me! I'm up! [laughs]\nSpike: Uh, yeah. I know you're doing the announcing today and stuff and... I'm sure you're gonna do a great job and all, but... I was just wondering...\nPinkie Pie: What?\nSpike: Aw... forget it.\nPinkie Pie: Spike, would you like to be my co-reporter? We could comment on the action together.\nSpike: We could?\nPinkie Pie: Climb on up!\nApplejack: Twilight? What in tarnation are you doin' up here?\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm racing.\nRainbow Dash: [laughs] Good one, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm not joking.\nRainbow Dash: What? You're not an athlete, you're a... well... you're an egghead.\nTwilight Sparkle: I am not an egghead, I am well-read.\nRainbow Dash: [softly] Egghead.\nApplejack: [snickers] But have you ever run a race?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, no, but I do know a lot about running.\nRainbow Dash: And you know this from...\nTwilight Sparkle: Books. I've read several on the subject.\nRainbow Dash: What'd you read, \"The Egghead's Guide to Running\"?\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\nRainbow Dash: Did you stretch out your eye muscles to warm up? [laugh] Get it? Eye muscles.\nTwilight Sparkle: Scoff if you must, Rainbow. But the Running of the Leaves is a Ponyville tradition, and since I'm here to learn, I've decided I should experience it myself.\nApplejack: Well, I think that's just dandy, Twilight. Good luck. [snickers]\nRainbow Dash: Yeah. See you at the finish line... tomorrow.\nPinkie Pie: All right, ponies, are you ready?\nSpike: Get set.\n[bell rings]\nPinkie Pie: And they're off! Welcome to the official coverage of the Running of the Leaves! You know, Spike, despite its name, the leaves don't do any of the actual running. No, that's left to my little ponies.\nSpike: Why, yes, Pinkie, it's the running of the ponies that causes the leaves to fall.\nPinkie Pie: Ugh. Those lazy, lazy leaves. But this year, the run is about more than the weather. It's about the race to the finish and the two runners who want to win it: Applejack and Rainbow Dash.\nSpike: You know, Pinkie, these two ponies have a bit of a grudge match they're trying to settle. Trying to prove who's the most athletic.\nPinkie Pie: Yes, and \"grudge\" rhymes with \"fudge\".\nSpike: Yes, it... does. What?\nPinkie Pie: And I like fudge. But if I eat too much fudge I get a pudge and then I can't budge.\nSpike: So... no fudge?\nPinkie Pie: Oh, no thanks. I had a big breakfast. Let's check in with our two competitive ponies, Applejack and Rainbow Dash. Having come fast out of the gate, Applejack and Rainbow Dash are evenly matched running neck and neck. But what's this? Applejack is making a move, she's now ahead by a nose. But Rainbow Dash won't let Applejack have it and takes the lead. She's ahead by half a nose. Or maybe three quarters of a nose. No, about sixty-three point seven percent of a nose... roughly speaking. Applejack sees this move and pushes forth with her strong workhorse legs slinking ahead by three hundred and fifty noses!\nApplejack: Not so easy without wings, is it?\nRainbow Dash: Come on, Rainbow. Show 'em a little dash.\nSpike: Ho-hold your horses, Pinkie! Rainbow Dash is catching up the frontrunner Applejack!\nPinkie Pie: What an upset. I thought Applejack had this in the bag.\nRainbow Dash: You didn't think I was gonna let you off that easily, did you?\nApplejack: Whoa! I don't believe it.\nTwilight Sparkle: I know, it's beautiful, isn't it?\nApplejack: Not the scenery, Twilight. Rainbow Dash just tripped me.\nTwilight Sparkle: She did not.\nApplejack: She did too!\nTwilight Sparkle: She did not, and if you slowed down and looked where you're going, like me, you'd see that you tripped over a rock.\nApplejack: What? Oh, hayseed! Now I got a lot of ground to make up to catch Rainbow.\nTwilight Sparkle: Just be careful!\n\nApplejack: See you at the finish line!\nSpike: I don't believe it. After a huge setback, Applejack is back at the front of the pack.\nPinkie Pie: She's the head of the pack, all right. The pick of the litter! The cat's pajamas! Oh wait, why would Applejack take some poor kitty's PJs? That's not very sporting of her.\nSpike: Oookay... let's get back to the race.\nRainbow Dash: Not so fast, Applejack! This race isn't over yet!\nApplejack: It is for you. Heh.\nRainbow Dash: Whoa! Guh, I don't believe it, Applejack tripped me.\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't you ponies ever look where you're going? You tripped on a stump. See?\nRainbow Dash: Oh, I see. A big cheater is what I see.\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow, Applejack would never cheat. It was just an accident.\nRainbow Dash: Sure it was. I mean, yeah, I'm sure it was.\nTwilight Sparkle: Remember, Rainbow, this is just a game.\nRainbow Dash: Yes, but the rules have changed, and two can play at that game.\n\nPinkie Pie: Welcome back, Ponyvillians, it's me, Pinkie Pie.\nSpike: And Spike. Looks like Rainbow is doing her best to catch up.\nPinkie Pie: I'm not sure how ketchup is going to help her in this contest. Now, in a hot dog eating contest it can make them doggies nice and slippery, but personally, I prefer mustard. How about you, Spike?\nSpike: Uh... I... like... pickles?\nPinkie Pie: Aaand it looks like Applejack has found herself in quite a pickle as Rainbow overtakes her.\nRainbow Dash: Look, ma, no wings.\nSpike: As the racers enter Equestria's Whitetail Wood, Rainbow Dash is back in the lead.\nRainbow Dash: [chuckles]\nApplejack: Ugh. Hey, Rainbow!\nRainbow Dash: [blows raspberry]\nApplejack: [gasp] Why, that little cheater did that on purpose. It's on.\n\nRainbow Dash: Nice one, Rainbow.\nApplejack: Later!\nRainbow Dash: Grr! [gasp] Aaa! [laughs]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh my, Whitetail Wood is just lovely. Hey, Rainbow, shouldn't you be up ahead?\nRainbow Dash: [chuckling] I'm sure I'll win now.\nTwilight Sparkle: Except that the other racers just passed you.\nRainbow Dash: Oh horse apples... see ya!\n\nPinkie Pie: Applejack, what are you doing up here?\nSpike: There aren't even any trees.\nApplejack: Er, no, but the sign's pointed this way... [whinnies] Rainbow. Mind giving me a lift?\n\nRainbow Dash: What the hay?! You said no flying!\nApplejack: No, I said no wings.\nPinkie Pie: I must say, Spike, that this has been the most interesting Running of the Leaves in Equestria history!\nSpike: With the most interesting announcing...\nPinkie Pie: But it isn't the running that's been fascinating. It's the lack of running!\nRainbow Dash: [grunt] Aaa!\nApplejack: Whoa!\nRainbow Dash: Whoa!\nTwilight Sparkle: Forgive me, girls. I know I'm not an athlete, but shouldn't the Running of the Leaves actually involve running?\nRainbow Dash: You know, I think Twilight's right.\nApplejack: You do?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! If you wanna beat me, you better... RUUUN!\n\nPinkie Pie: Once again, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are neck and neck, jockeying for position. Applejack inches ahead, now it's Rainbow, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack...\n[horn blaring, crowd cheering]\nApplejack: [grunt]\nSpike: Oh no, she di'int!\nPinkie Pie: Oh yes, she di'id!\nApplejack: Cut it out!\nRainbow Dash: No, you cut it out!\nApplejack: You started it.\nRainbow Dash: And now I'm gonna finish it.\nApplejack: Oh no, you won't.\nRainbow Dash: Oh yes, I will. [grunt] That's it! All bets are off!\nApplejack: Oh no, you don't.\nPinkie Pie: It's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash--\nRainbow Dash: I won!\nApplejack: No, I won!\nRainbow Dash: I won!\nSpike: You tied!\nApplejack and Rainbow Dash: Tied?!\nApplejack: For first?\nPinkie Pie: For last!\nApplejack: Last?!\nRainbow Dash: Then who won?\nApplejack and Rainbow Dash: You?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh no, but I did get fifth place, which is rather good considering I've never run a race before.\nApplejack: What? How's that even possible?\nRainbow Dash: You ran so slow, and looked at the scenery.\nTwilight Sparkle: Exactly. I paced myself, just like my book said. Then at the end, when all the other ponies were worn out, I sprinted to the finish.\nRainbow Dash: I don't believe it. Twilight beat us.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, with all your horsing around, it was quite easy.\nApplejack: You're right, Twilight. Our behavior was just terrible.\nRainbow Dash: We weren't very good sports.\nPrincess Celestia: Sounds to me that an important lesson was learned.\nApplejack and Rainbow Dash: Princess Celestia?!\nApplejack: W-What are you doin' here?\nPrincess Celestia: Fall is one of my favorite seasons, so I came to celebrate the Running of the Leaves.\nApplejack: I'm sorry you had to see us being such poor sports, Princess.\nPrincess Celestia: That's all right, Applejack. Anypony can get swept up in the excitement of competition.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's important to remember that the friendship is always more important than the competition.\nPrincess Celestia: Exactly, Twilight. Now, unfortunately, because the two of you were busy tricking each other instead of shaking down leaves, many of the lovely trees of Equestria are still covered.\nApplejack: Why, Princess, I bet we can knock those leaves down for you lickety-split. Whaddya say, friend? Wanna go for another run?\nRainbow Dash: I'd love to stretch my legs.\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nRarity: Oh, Opalescence. Can't you just picture it?

Could you please fix the button for me? It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala.\nRarity: [gasps] Oh, no, no, no! You can't wear this... old thing. You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala and I'll make it for you. No problem at all. It will be my pleasure!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer, Rarity, but I can't let you do that. It would be so much work. This dress is fine.\nRarity: Twilight Sparkle. I insist on making you a new dress.\nTwilight Sparkle: But...\nRarity: Not another word! I won't take no for an answer.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, in that case... thank you for your generosity, Rarity. Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure it will be absolutely beautiful.\nRarity: Let me guess, Applejack. You don't want a new gown either.\nApplejack: Gown? Shoot. I was just gonna wear my old work duds.\nRarity: You can't possibly be serious, Applejack! You absolutely must wear formal attire.\nApplejack: Hm... nah.\nRarity: What if I just spruce up your... duds for you a little bit?\nApplejack: Um... okay, sure, why not?

[gasp] Idea! I'll make you an outfit for the Gala too, Rainbow Dash.\nRainbow Dash: Outfit for the what now?\nRarity: I'll make one for you and you and all of you. Oh! And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too. Oh, and when I'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show!\nTwilight Sparkle: What a great idea! If you're sure you can handle it.\nRarity: Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business.

You haven't come out for days.\nRarity: I'm never coming out! I can't show my face in Ponyville ever again! I used to be somepony. I used to be respected. I made dresses.

[sobs]\nTwilight Sparkle: You're not a laughing stock, Rarity...\nRainbow Dash: She kind of is.\nTwilight Sparkle: Shhh! Come on out and talk to us.\nRarity: [sobbing] Leave me alone!

I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile. Where would I go? And what would I pack? Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing.

And I learned this: when somepony offers to do you a favor, like making you a beautiful dress, you shouldn't be overly critical of something generously given to you. In other words, you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. [giggles]\nHoity Toity: Rarity, my congratulations to you on a most impressive fashion debut.

Why are you hanging out in a ditch?\nSpike: Because, Pinkie Pie predicted it!\nTwilight Sparkle: Honestly, Spike, she did not. Two coincidences in a row like this may be unlikely, but it's still easier to believe than twitchy tails that predict the future.\nApplejack: [gasp] Twitchy tail? Pinkie Sense? Whoa! Nyu-uh!\nSpike: Don't worry, it's safe. Prediction already came true.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, wait. Don't tell me you believe in this stuff, too?\nApplejack: I know it doesn't make much sense, but those of us who have been in Ponyville a while have learned over time that, if Pinkie's a-twichin', you better listen.\nPinkie Pie: My ears are flopping! My ears are flopping!\nSpike: Nyuh! What does that mean?!\nPinkie Pie: I'll start a bath for you.\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh? [chuckles] A bath? This thing keeps on getting more ridiculous by the minute!\n[splash]\nTwilight Sparkle: [grumble]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [blows]\nPinkie Pie: Sooo, basically, it works like this: I get different, little, niggly feelings and they mean different things. Like when my back is itchy, it means it's my lucky day. And, when my knee gets pinchy, that means something scary's about to happen.\nTwilight Sparkle: Is your knee pinchy now?\nPinkie Pie: No, but my shoulder's achy. That means there's an alligator in the tub.\n[splash]\nTwilight Sparkle: [scream] How come your knee didn't get pinchy?! That isn't just scary, it's downright dangerous!\nPinkie Pie: No, it's not, silly! This is my pet alligator, Gummy. He's got no teeth. See? Haha!\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, okay... I get it.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, I still don't believe all this... \"special power\" stuff. It's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.\nPinkie Pie: What's not to believe? You do magic, what's the difference?\nTwilight Sparkle: Huge! For one thing, [clears throat] magic is something you study and practice. It only happens when you decide to do it, and it's meant to make something specific that you choose to happen, happen. With you, uh, it makes no sense at all!\nPinkie Pie: That's so not true, Twilight! Sometimes it's a bunch of random things happening to my body at random times that supposedly predict the future. I call 'em \"combos\".\nTwilight Sparkle: Combos?\nPinkie Pie: Sure! You know, like, ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. That means the sky is about to be graced with a beautiful rainbow!\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah, sure.\nPinkie Pie: Uh-oh, I feel a combo coming on. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch!\n[crash]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh!\n[beeping]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ughhh... You said that combo meant \"beautiful rainbow\".\nPinkie Pie: Oh no-no-no-no-no. You're thinking of an ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. This was an ear flop, then eye flutter, then knee twitch. That usually means \"look out for opening doors\". You okay?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't believe this.\nPinkie Pie: You don't believe because you don't understand.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmm...\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay.

Anything?\nPinkie Pie: Wait! Hold on! Uhh, no.\nTwilight Sparkle: Are you kidding me?! After a whole day of nonstop twitching, now that I've got you all hooked up, you're not getting a single one?\nPinkie Pie: I don't control it, they just come and go.\nTwilight Sparkle: That makes no sense!\nPinkie Pie: Sometimes you just have to believe in things, even when you can't figure 'em out.\nTwilight Sparkle: I will not believe in anything I cannot explain.\nPinkie Pie: Wait, hold on, I'm feeling something...\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh my gosh, what? What is it?!\n[Pinkie Pie's stomach growls]\nPinkie Pie: It's my tummy! That usually means I'm hungry! Let's eat!\nTwilight Sparkle: Urgh... You know what? [bite] [snap] Just forget it!

I'm doing scientific research. I'm observing Pinkie Pie, scientific name: Pinkius Pieicus, in its natural habitat.\nSpike: Pinkius-whoicus? Hh!\nTwilight Sparkle: There's something fishy going on with the whole twitchy prediction thing, and I'm getting to the bottom of it. So, shh. Come on, Pinkius Pieicus is on the move.\n\nPinkie Pie: [humming]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hm... Itchy nose...\nPinkie Pie: [gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: Aha! That makes no sense. See? She's hiding like something's about to fall from the sky, but a twitchy tail means something's gonna fall from the sky, not an itchy nose.\n[swarm of bees buzzing]\nTwilight Sparkle: This proves...\nSpike: [gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: ...perhaps conclusively, that\u2014\nSpike: Gah!\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike!

[whimper]\n\nSpike: What's she doing now?\nTwilight Sparkle: Smelling a flower.\nSpike: Holy guacamole! I wonder what that means?\nTwilight Sparkle: Probably that the flower smells good. Wait. I'm getting something. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch.\nSpike: Hold on... You told me that's the combo that says \"watch out for opening doors\"!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh-ho. You really, really believe this stuff, don't you? Here, let me show you there's nothing to be afraid of. You see? I promise you there's nothing to fear from that\u2014 Wo-o-ah! Ow! Ugh! Ow! Ow!\nApplejack: Twilight! You came to visit my new apple cellar, how nice. Twi? You okay? Uh, Twi?\n\nSpike: Here, let me help you.\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, take this down: twitchy tail.\nSpike: Twitchy tail? [gasp] Twitchy tail!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hush, Spike! We can't let Pinkie know we're here, remember?\nSpike: Something's gonna fall, something's gonna fall! Run for your lives. Ah-ha-ha!\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh. Spike, honestly. You're overreact\u2014\n[crack]\n[clang]\n[smash]\n[crash]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh!\n\nPinkie Pie: [humming] Hey, Applejack. Whatcha doin'?\nApplejack: Takin' more apples to my new apple cellar. How 'bout you, Pinkie? Whatchu doin'?\nPinkie Pie: Oh, letting Twilight secretly follow me all day without me knowing.\nTwilight Sparkle: You mean you knew all along?! Why didn't you tell me?\nPinkie Pie: [giggles] Silly, that would've spoiled the secret!\nTwilight Sparkle: Urgh!\nSpike: Tail... still twitching?\nPinkie Pie: All done, clear skies from here on in, as far as I can tell\u2014 Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!\nSpike: Oh no! What does that one mean?\nPinkie Pie: Dunno, never gotten any like it before, but whatever that shudder's about, it's a doozy. Something you'd never expect to happen is gonna happen! Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu hu-bu-bu-bu! And it's gonna happen... at Froggy Bottom Bogg!\nApplejack: [gasp] That's where Fluttershy's headed!\nSpike: Oh no! Is it about her?\nPinkie Pie: Uh, I'm not sure.\nApplejack: We better go and make sure she's okay.\nTwilight Sparkle: Calm down, everypony. All we know right now is that Pinkie Pie just got a case of the shivers. That's all.\nSpike: Guh\u2014 Hey! I thought you didn't believe in this stuff?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't. I just want to be there to see the look on Pinkie's face when we find out nothing's wrong.\nPinkie Pie: Okie-dokie!\n\n[gate creaks]\n[frogs croak]\n\nPinkie Pie: [shivers] Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!\nTwilight Sparkle: Cold? Need a jacket or something?\nPinkie Pie: No thanks, I'm fine. [shivers] Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!\nSpike: So... Whadda'ya think happened to Fluttershy?\nApplejack: I hope nothin'.\nSpike: I know, but, whadda'ya think happened?\nApplejack: I'm tryin' not to think about it.\nSpike: Me too. But I'm thinkin' about it anyway. Like, what if she exploded?\nApplejack: Just exploded? For no reason?\nSpike: Yeah, like boom!\nPinkie Pie: Whoa!\nSpike: I know.\nPinkie Pie: What if... What if she exploded, and then... and then exploded again!?\nSpike: Can you do that? Can you explode twice?\nApplejack: Of course not.\nSpike: But what if she exploded, and exploded again, and then\u2014 ugh!\nTwilight Sparkle: Will you two stop? She's fine, I'm sure of it.\nApplejack: I hope you're right, for Fluttershy's sake. Look! There's Froggy Bottom Bogg!\n[dragonfly buzzing]\nApplejack: Fluttershy?\nPinkie Pie: Fluttershy? [gasp]\nSpike: Fluttershy! You're okay!\nFluttershy: Of course.\nApplejack: Phew, what a relief.\nPinkie Pie: I'm so glad everything's all right.\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry, I know it's not nice to gloat but... Aha! I told you there was nothing to worry about, and I was right. Pinkie Pie said whatever she was shuddering about was a [cough] doozy, and [cough] and the only [cough] doozy here is how right I am.\nApplejack: Um... Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie's made a lot of predictions today but [cough] ugh, what is that smell? But what we've shown here is that there's no point in believing [cough] in anything you can't see for yourself.\nSpike: W-Well t-then, s-see what's b-b-behind you, Twilight!\n[hydra growls]\nTwilight Sparkle: I see it... but I don't believe it!\n[hydra roars]\n\nPinkie Pie: Is that a hydra?!\nApplejack: Who cares?

Hang on!\n[hydra growls]\nTwilight Sparkle: I think we're gonna make it.\nSpike: But Pinkie's still shuddering!\nPinkie Pie: Oh, lookie there, it stopped. O-h-h-h, t-h-e-r-e i-t i-s a-g-a-i-n!\n[ponies gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh, he'll be up here in no time! Quick, one at a time, cross!\nSpike: Nyu-uh! Uh, do you know any spells for turning a hydra into a mouse?\nTwilight Sparkle: No.\nSpike: How about a squirrel?\nTwilight Sparkle: No!\nSpike: How 'bout\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: No small rodents of any kind!\nSpike: That's too bad.\nFluttershy: A hop, skip, and a... jump!\nSpike: Whoa-ho!\nPinkie Pie: Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!\nApplejack: [grunt]\nTwilight: He's too close. I'll distract him. You two go, now!\n[whoosh]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh... What would a brave pony like Rainbow Dash do?

Blegh!\n[ponies cheer]\nPinkie Pie: I knew you could do it, Twilight!\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know how it happened; coincidence, dumb luck, or what, but you said there'd be a doozy here at Froggy Bottom Bogg, and I'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy. I mean that hydra\u2014\nPinkie Pie: [shudders]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie?\nPinkie Pie: That wasn't it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh?\nSpike: What wasn't what?\nApplejack: What are you talking about, Pink?\nPinkie Pie: The hydra wasn't the doozy.\n[hydra blows raspberry]\nPinkie Pie: I'm still getting the shudders. Oo-o-oh, oo-o-oh! You see? There it is again. Whatever the doozy was at Froggy Bottom Bogg, my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened.\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh? But I\u2014 WHAT?! The hydra wasn't the doozy?! How could it not be the doozy?! What could be doozier than that?!\nPinkie Pie: Dunno, but it just wasn't it.\n[kettle whistles]\nTwilight Sparkle: Rrrgh... [flames and growls] Ooh... I give up...\nSpike: Give what up, Twi?\nTwilight Sparkle: The fight. I can't fight it anymore. I don't understand how, why, or what, but Pinkie Sense somehow... makes sense. I don't see how it does, but it just does. Just because I don't understand doesn't mean it's not true.\nPinkie Pie: Y-Y-Y-You m-m-mean you b-b-b-believe?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yup, I guess I do.\nPinkie Pie: Oo-woo-oo-oo-oo, woo-oo-oo-oo-oh, woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh! Ooh! [gasp] That was it! That's the doozy!\nSpike: Bbrrbbrrbbrr.\nTwilight Sparkle: What? What is?\nPinkie Pie: You believing! I never expected that to happen! That was the doozy, oh and, oh what a doozy of a doozy it was! La-la-la-la-la...\n\n[giggling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, good, Spike, you're here. Take a letter.\nSpike: With pleasure, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: Dear Princess Celestia, I'm happy to report that\u2014 Spike, what have I been saying about focus?\nSpike: I know, but I... Well...\nTwilight Sparkle: What's wrong, Spike? Never thought you'd see me with an umbrella hat on?\nSpike: Not really, no.\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie's tail's a-twitchin'. What else can I do?\n[laughter]\nTwilight Sparkle: I am happy to report that I now realize there are wonderful things in this world you just can't explain, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less true. It just means you have to choose to believe in them, and sometimes it takes a friend to show you the way.\nPinkie Pie: Honk!\nSpike: Honk.\nTwilight Sparkle: Always your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.\nPinkie Pie: There it goes again.\nTwilight Sparkle: I wonder what's gonna drop outta the sky this time?\nPinkie Pie: You never know.\nSpike: [inhales]\n[crash]\nSpike: Twitchy tail?

So now that you know the elements of a good cheer, let's hear one.\nFluttershy: [inhales] Yay.\nRainbow Dash: ...Ugh. You're gonna cheer for me like that? Louder.\nFluttershy: Yay.\nRainbow Dash: Louder!\nFluttershy: Yay.\nRainbow Dash: Louder!\nFluttershy: [deep breath] [quietly] Yaaay.\nRainbow Dash: Ugh...\n[thud]\nFluttershy: Too loud?\n\n[theme song]\n\nFluttershy: Yay.\nRainbow Dash: [deep breath] And now, phase one of my routine.\nFluttershy: Wooo.\nRainbow Dash: Phase two.\nFluttershy: Way to go.\nRainbow Dash: Here we go. Phase three. The sonic rainboom. C'mon! [grunt] Uh-oh. [scream]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [sigh] Last one. Thank you so much for helping me clean up all these books, guys. It was a crazy week of studying.\nRainbow Dash: [screams]\n[crash]\nTwilight Sparkle: [grunt]\nPinkie Pie: [grunt]\nApplejack: [grunt]\nFluttershy: Rainbow Dash, you rock! Woohoo. [gasp] Did my cheering do that?\nRainbow Dash: Hehe. Sorry about that ladies. That was a truly feeble performance.\nFluttershy: Actually, it wasn't all bad. I particularly liked it when you made the clouds spin.\nRainbow Dash: Ugh. I'm not talking about my performance, I'm talking about yours. That feeble cheering!\nTwilight Sparkle: What are you two arguing about?\nFluttershy: Were we arguing? I'm sorry.\nRainbow Dash: [grunt] I wish you guys could come to Cloudsdale to see me compete in the Best Young Flyer Competition.\nTwilight Sparkle: What's that?\nPinkie Pie: It's where all the greatest Pegasus flyers get together and show off their different flying styles! Some are fast! [makes car sounds] And some are graceful. Whoa, whoa, whoa!\nApplejack: Golly. I'd love to see you strut yer stuff in that competition.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah. I wish you guys could be there. Fluttershy's a great support, but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational.\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! I'd love to see you make a sonic rainboom! It's like, the most coolest thing ever! Even though I've never actually seen it, but I mean come on! It's a sonic rainboom! How not cool could it possibly not be?!\nTwilight Sparkle: What's a sonic rainboom?\nPinkie Pie: You really need to get out more. The sonic rainboom is legendary! When a Pegasus like Rainbow Dash gets going sooo fast... Boom! A sonic boom and a rainbow can happen all at once!\nApplejack: And Rainbow Dash here's the only pony to ever pull it off!\nRainbow Dash: It was a long time ago... I was just a filly.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah, but you're gonna do it again, right?\nRainbow Dash: Are... you kidding? I'm the greatest flyer to ever come out of Cloudsdale! I could do sonic rainbooms in my sleep.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow. If you pull that off, you'll win the crown for sure!\nRainbow Dash: The grand prize is an entire day with the Wonderbolts. A whole day of flying with my lifelong heroes... It'll be a dream come true!\nFluttershy: Yay.\nRainbow Dash: I'm gonna go rest up. Don't wanna over prepare myself, y'know. Hehe. You, on the other hand, better keep practicing. I need a cheering section to match my spectacular performance.\nFluttershy: She's practiced that move a hundred times, and she's never even come close to doing it. I don't know if I can cheer loud enough to help her.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, guess we better get this cleaned up... again.\nRarity: Go on, go on.\nTwilight Sparkle: Go on what?\nRarity: Find a spell that will get us wingless ponies into Cloudsdale. Didn't you see how nervous she was?\nApplejack: Nervous? Have you spit yer bit or somethin'? She was tootin' her own horn louder than the brass section of a marching band!\nRarity: Oh, puh-lease. I have put on enough fashion shows to recognize stage fright when I see it. We've got to find a way to be there for her. Now go on!\nTwilight Sparkle: Owaa! Ugh. How am I supposed to find a flight spell in this mess?\nPinkie Pie: A flight spell? One sec. Page twenty-seven.\nApplejack: How'd you do that?\nPinkie Pie: It landed on my face when Rainbow Dash knocked me into the bookcase.\nTwilight Sparkle: Here it is! A spell that will allow Earth ponies to fly for three days. Ooh, it looks really difficult... I'm not sure I can do it.\nRarity: You've got to try!\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay... But who's gonna volunteer to be the test subject?\nRarity: I will! For Rainbow Dash, I will go first.\nTwilight Sparkle: Here goes. [grunts] [screams]\nApplejack: [gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: I think it worked!\n\nRainbow Dash: You've got to learn to be assertive, Fluttershy. Don't be afraid to speak up.\nDumb-Bell: Well, well, well. What do we have here?\nHoops: It's our old friend Rainbow Crash!\nDumb-Bell: Get kicked outta any flight schools lately?\nDumb-Bell, Hoops, and Score: [laughs]\nRainbow Dash: I didn't get kicked out.\nDumb-Bell: Face it, Rainbow Crash. Flight school had too many rules and not enough naptimes for you.\nHoops: Huh, ask her about the sonic rainboom.\nDumb-Bell: That's nothing but an old mare's tale. You don't have the skills to try something like that.\nFluttershy: Now wait just a minute! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm trying to be more assertive. Anyhow, she is going to do a sonic rainboom!\nDumb-Bell: No she's not, 'cause there's no such thing!\nFluttershy: Then show up at the Cloudeseum and see for yourself! ...If you're free.\nDumb-Bell, Hoops, and Score: [laughs]\nHoops: [within laughter] Yeah, I'll be free.\nDumb-Bell: Oh, don't worry. We'll be there!\nHoops: See you then, Rainbow Crash!\nFluttershy: Did you see that? I was so assertive!\nRainbow Dash: [sigh] Those guys are right. I'll never be able to do it.\nFluttershy: But Rainbow Dash, just because you've failed the sonic rainboom a hundred thousand times in practice doesn't mean you won't be able to do it in front of an entire stadium, full of impatient, super-critical sportsfan ponies.\nRainbow Dash: Aaaaaah! What do I do?! Everypony's gonna see me fail! The Wonderbolts will never let a loser like me join! Princess Celestia will probably banish me to the Everfree Forest! My life is ruined!\nFluttershy: Rare...\nRainbow Dash: Rare?! The sonic rainboom is way more than rare!\nFluttershy: Rarity?\nRainbow Dash: Rarity! Are you... flying?!\nRarity: I most certainly am! Aren't my wings smashing?! Twilight made them for me. I just adore them! Why so shocked? We couldn't leave our favorite flyer without a big cheering section!\nRainbow Dash: \"We\"? I... I can't believe it!\nFluttershy: It's incredible!\nRainbow Dash: This is so cool! You guys made it!\nPinkie Pie: Sure did!\nRainbow Dash: Wait! How'd you do that? Only Pegasus ponies can walk on clouds.\nPinkie Pie: Haha. Pretty cool, huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: I found a spell that makes temporary wings, but it was too difficult to do more than once. So I found an easier spell that lets the rest of us walk on clouds.\nApplejack: And we came to cheer you to victory!\nRainbow Dash: To be honest, I was starting to get just the teeniest, tiniest bit nervous. But I feel a lot better now that you guys are here. Hey, we've got some time before the competition. Why don't Fluttershy and I show you around Cloudsdale?\nRarity, Applejack, Twilight Sparkle and Pinkie Pie: Yes!\n\nRainbow Dash: Here it is: the greatest city in the sky!\nGroup: Oooh! Aaah!\nRarity: [in mirror] Oooh! Aaah!\nRainbow Dash: Uhh... Some of the greatest Pegasi in history came from Cloudsdale!\nRarity: Oh, wait for me!\n[jackhammer sounds]\nSteam Roller: Those wings are gorgeous!\nRarity: Why, thank you!\nTwilight Sparkle: Be careful with those wings, Rarity. They're made from gossamer and morning dew, and they're incredibly delicate.\nRarity: Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure they can't get worn out from too much attention.\nApplejack: Since we're up here, I'd sure like to get a look at where the weather's made.\nRainbow Dash: Great idea! C'mon, girls. To the weather factory!\n\n[thunder]\nRainbow Dash: This is where they make the snowflakes. Each one is hoofmade. As you can see, it's a delicate operation.\nRarity: [gasp] Ooh, the snowflakes look even better from up here.\n[snowflake workers grumbling and yelling]\nRainbow Dash: We better move on before Rarity ruins winter and causes a drought.\n\nRainbow Dash: And here's where they make the rainbows!\nPinkie Pie: [slurp] [pants] Spicyyyyyy!...\nApplejack: [laughs]\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, rainbows aren't really known for their flavor.\nDumb-Bell: Whoa! Oh, where'd you get those amazing wings? I want a pair!\nRarity: Hmm... Yeah, I guess I could see that.\nDumb-Bell: Oh, hey look, it's Rainbow Crash again!\nHoops: Heheheyeah! Rainbow... umm... eyah... Crash!\nRainbow Dash: Rarity! What're you doing talking to these guys?\nRarity: Oh, they were just admiring my wings, Rainbow Dash.\nDumb-Bell: Yeah, you should forget the sonic rainboom and just get yourself some wings like these!\nDumb-Bell, Hoops, and Score: [laughs]\nRainbow Dash: Oohh...\nFluttershy: Uhh... C'mon, girls. Why don't we go see how clouds are made? Don't listen to them. You're gonna win that competition for sure!\nRainbow Dash: Are you kidding? I can't do the sonic rainboom, and just look at these boring, plain old feathered wings. I'm doomed!\n\n[group of workers awing at Rarity]\nRarity: What, these old things? Go ahead, everypony. Photos are encouraged.\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity, we're supposed to be helping Rainbow Dash relax, remember? Put your wings away and stop showing off!\nRarity: Oh, pfft. How can you ask me to put away perfection?\n[workers awing]\nRarity: Waa-haa-haa!\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash, are you okay? You don't look so good.\nRainbow Dash: [panting] Of course! Why wouldn't I be okay? Everyone's so in love with Rarity's wings that they won't even notice when I totally blow it in the Best Young Flyer's Competition.\nRainbowshine: Hey! There's an idea! YOU should enter the competition!\nFoggy Fleece: Yeah! I could watch you fly all day long!\nRarity: There really isn't anypony who uses their wings quite like me. Perhaps I should compete.\nRainbow Dash: WHAT?!\n[workers continue awing at Rarity]\nRainbow Dash: What am I gonna do?! I'll never win the competition now...\n\n[trumpet fanfare]\n[crowd cheering]\n[knock, knock, knock]\nRarity: I'm going to be a while!\nPinkie Pie: [giggles]\nDumb-Bell, Hoops, and Score: [laughs]\nRainbow Dash: [gulp]\nMadden: Fillies and gentlecolts!

Umm... Oh, I guess that's me!\n\nLucy Packard: Okay, number four, time to go.\nRarity: I'm number four, and I need just one more itsy-bitsy minute. Be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hmm?\nLucy Packard: Look, I don't care who it is, but somepony's gotta go on!\nMeadow Song: Let's do this!\nRainbow Dash: Uhh... What am I gonna do?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I loved number seven. Doing fifteen barrel rolls in a row can't be easy.\nFluttershy: My favorite is number ten. She just looked like such a nice pony.\nApplejack: Hmm... Wonder how come we haven't seen Rainbow Dash or Rarity yet. The competition's almost over.\nLucy Packard: Number fifteen, let's go!\nRarity: Rarity... is ready!\nLucy Packard: Look, ladies. I don't know what to tell you. There's only time for one more performance. If you both want to compete, you'll just have to go out there together!\nRarity: Well, Rainbow Dash? Shall we?\nRainbow Dash: [scared babbling]\nMadden: And now, for our final competitor of the day, contestant number fifteen! Uhh... And apparently contestant number four...\n[crowd cheering]\nRarity: Good luck, Rainbow Dash. Just do your best. I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of changing our music. That \"rock and roll\" doesn't really match my wings.\n[classical music]\nRainbow Dash: [gulp] C'mon, Rainbow Dash. You can do this. Just remember the routine. Phase one.\n[crowd cheering]\nRainbow Dash: Oof. Waaah!\nHoops: Nice work, Rainbow Crash!\nDumb-Bell, Hoops and Score: [laugh]\nRainbow Dash: Time for phase two.\nFluttershy: Look! Phase two is working.\n[ponies cheering]\nPrincess Celestia: [gasp]\nRarity: And now for my grand finale. I will fly right up to the sun and beam my beautiful wings over the whole city of Cloudsdale! [gasp and squeal] They'll be talking about it for years!\nRainbow Dash: Looks like this is my last chance to turn things around. Phase three. The sonic [gulp] rainboom.

She did it! She did it! Wooo!\nRainbow Dash: Whoa.\n[crowd cheering]\nFluttershy: A sonic rainboom! Wooo! Yeah!\nRainbow Dash: I did it. I did it!\nRarity: [sigh] You sure did. Oh thank you, Rainbow Dash. You saved my life!\nRainbow Dash: Oh yeah. I did that too. Ha, best day ever!\n\nRarity: I want to apologize to all of you for getting so carried away with my... beautiful wings. I guess I just lost my head.\nFluttershy: It's okay.\nApplejack: Oh, don't worry about it, kiddo.\nPinkie Pie: We still love you.\nRarity: And I'm especially sorry that I was so thoughtless as to jump into the contest at the last minute after you had worked so hard to win it. Can you ever ever forgive me?\nRainbow Dash: Aw, it's okay. Everything turned out all right, right? I just wish I could have met the Wonderbolts when they were awake.

I learned how important it is to keep your hooves on the ground, and be there for your friends.\nPrincess Celestia: Excellent. Well done, Rarity.\nRainbow Dash: This really is the best day ever!\nDumb-Bell: Uhh, hey, Rainbow Crash.\nHoops: Dash!\nDumb-Bell: Oh! Uhh... Sorry. Rainbow Dash. Uhh, we just wanted to congratulate you on winning the competition.\nHoops: That sonic rainboom was awesome!\nRainbow Dash: Heh, thanks, guys.\nDumb-Bell: Uhh, we're really sorry we gave you such a hard time before.\nRainbow Dash: Aww, that's okay.

I can't get near her without getting a swipe from her claws.\nOpalescence: [hisses]\nRarity: Ahh! Did you use... the Stare on her?\nFluttershy: Oh, no! I wouldn't! I couldn't! I-I don't really have any control over when that happens. I-It just happens. No, I'm just good with animals. It's my special gift, you know?\nRarity: Well, you should have a picture of Opal as a cutie mark instead of those butterflies.\nSweetie Belle: Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Maybe I can be good with animals, too!\n[shing!]\nSweetie Belle: Or not.\nFluttershy and Rarity: [laughs]\nRarity: I'm sorry I can't invite you to stay and chat, Fluttershy. I've bitten off a bit more than I can chew with this order.\nSweetie Belle: But you're not eating anything.\nRarity: No, Sweetie, it's an expression. It means that I've taken on more work than I can handle. I've got twenty of these special robes to make tonight! They're due in Trottingham tomorrow morning.\n[twinkling]\nFluttershy: [gasp]\nRarity: See? I've lined them in a special gold silk. It took so long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?\nFluttershy: These are lovely, but twenty by tonight? How will you get it all done?\nRarity: Well, I, uh...\nSweetie Belle: Oh, oh, oh! Maybe I could... just... just stand over here and watch.\nRarity: I'll manage.\nFluttershy: Well, maybe I should get out of your mane so you can work.\nApple Bloom and Scootaloo: Hi, Fluttershy! Hi, Rarity!\nRarity: Hello, uh, girls...\nApple Bloom and Scootaloo: Hey, Sweetie Belle!\nSweetie Belle: Scootaloo! Apple Bloom!\nScootaloo: You ready for tonight?\nSweetie Belle: Yup! Cutie mark planning session is a go!\nApple Bloom: Tonight is the night we each try to find our own special talent.\nScootaloo: Even if it takes us all night!\nApple Bloom: I'm ready! You ready?\nScootaloo: Very ready!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover at Rarity's! Yay!\nSweetie Belle: And... look what I made us!\n[trumpet flourish]\nApple Bloom and Scootaloo: Oh, wow! [laughter, gasps] That's so cool! Oooh!\nFluttershy: What does that patch on your cape mean?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: The Cutie Mark Crusaders! Yay!\nScootaloo: We're on a crusade, a mission!\nApple Bloom: To find our cutie marks!\nSweetie Belle: Yup. And look. I lined them with this special gold silk. It took sooo long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?\nApple Bloom and Scootaloo: Oooooh!\nRarity: Sweetie Belle! What have you done? That was the last of the gold silk! Oh, now I'll have to make more! Oh, I hope I can make more. I'm gonna have to work all night! Which means... Sorry, girls, I'm afraid the Crusaders sleepover is cancelled.\nSweetie Belle: What?!\nRarity: I just won't have any time to watch you if I want to get these robes delivered on time.\nSweetie Belle: But\u2014\nRarity: No buts this time. I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle. It's just the way it has to be.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Awwww...\nFluttershy: I, uh, I suppose I could take them for the night.\nRarity: I couldn't ask you to do that.\nFluttershy: Oh, it's no problem at all.\nRarity: Have you met my sister and her friends? A problem is all it would be.\nFluttershy: Did I have a problem with Opal? You've seen how well I handle small creatures!\nRarity: I suppose that's true... and I do have a lot of work to do...\nFluttershy: Come on, it'll be fun.\nRarity: I assure you, they're quite a handful.\nFluttershy: These sweet little angels?\nRarity: Well... all right.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover at Fluttershy's cottage! Yay!\nFluttershy: So cute. W-wait for me!\nRarity: Hmmm...\n\nFluttershy: Oh, won't this be ever so fun? We can have a nice little tea party, and braid each others' tails, and sit quietly and color, and tell each other fairy tales, and\u2014\n[rush of air, clattering hooves]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [giggling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hello, Fluttershy.\nFluttershy: Oh! Hello, Twilight. Where are you off to?\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm heading to the Everfree Forest to Zecora's to get some of my favorite tea.\nFluttershy: Th-The Everfree Forest? Ah, you'll be careful, won't you?\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course! How about you? What are you doing with the girls?\nFluttershy: Rarity has a big order to fill tonight, so I volunteered to take the girls over to my cottage for a sleepover.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow. Sounds like everypony has their hooves full today. Taking care of those three fillies all by yourself? You sure you can handle it?\nFluttershy: What? These sweet little angels? They'll be no problem at all.\n\n[crickets chirping, owl hooting]\n[door closes]\nSweetie Belle: Wow! Look at this place! What's that? Are those chickens?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [unintelligible chatter]\nFluttershy: [to herself] No... problem at all. [normal] Okay, girls, uh, what should we do?\nScootaloo: I'm gonna get my mark first!\nFluttershy: Girls?\nSweetie Belle: Nuh-uh!\nFluttershy: Should we\u2014\nApple Bloom: I am!\nFluttershy: Girls, okay, now settle\u2014\nScootaloo: I'm staying up all night!\nApple Bloom: Me, too!\nSweetie Belle: Me, three!\nFluttershy: I-I know you're excited, but\u2014 girls, oh, oh, careful with the\u2014 oh, ah, girls\u2014 [huffs] So! What do you wanna do? Play a game?\nScootaloo: We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders!\nApple Bloom: And we want to crusade for our cutie marks!\nSweetie Belle: And, and, and, we, um\u2014 yeah! What they said!\nFluttershy: Mmm, I don't know... how about a nice quiet little tea party?\nScootaloo: Or... we could go adventuring in the Everfree Forest!\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: Yeah!\nFluttershy: Oh, no! The Everfree Forest is much too dangerous. It's filled with far too many strange creatures.\nSweetie Belle: But you could go with us and we could catch those creatures. We could be, umm... creature catchers!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Yay! Cutie Mark Crusader creature catchers!\nScootaloo: Arrrr! I am a dangerous creature from the Everfree Forest! Rrrarr!\nSweetie Belle: Halt, dangerous creature of the Everfree Forest. I am Sweetie Belle, the creature catcher, and I'm here to catch you!\nScootaloo: You can never catch me! I am far too powerful and dangerous!\nSweetie Belle: You cannot run from me!\nScootaloo: Raaaar!\nSweetie Belle: [giggling]\nScootaloo: Raaaar! [giggling]\nFluttershy: Um, oh, maybe that's not such a\u2014 now, girls, how about we do some nice coloring? Doh\u2014\nSweetie Belle: Come back, dangerous creature, so I can catch you!\nScootaloo: Never!\nFluttershy: Careful... you don't...\n[crash]\nFluttershy: ...break anything.\nSweetie Belle: Sorry, Fluttershy.\nScootaloo: Yeah, sorry.\nApple Bloom: I guess we aren't creature catchers.\nFluttershy: Oh, girls, it's okay. I\u2014\nApple Bloom: I know! We could be Cutie Mark Crusader carpenters!\nFluttershy: C-carpenters?\nApple Bloom: Hammer!\nScootaloo: Hammer.\nSweetie Belle: Hammer!\nScootaloo: Hammer. Hammer! ...Hammer.\n[various construction sounds]\nSweetie Belle: Um ... that doesn't look like a table.\nScootaloo: We were making a table?\nApple Bloom: Somepony needs to put this thing out of its misery.\nScootaloo: We are definitely not Cutie Mark Carpenters.\nSweetie Belle: Who wants a picture of a hammer on their flank anyway?\nFluttershy: Well, now that we've gotten that out of the way, how about a game?\nApple Bloom: A game?\nFluttershy: It's called \"Shhh!\"\nScootaloo: What's that?\nFluttershy: Well, it's a game about who can be quiet the longest. Sound fun? I'm the world champ, you know. I bet you can't beat me! [squee] [deep breath]\nScootaloo: I lose!\nSweetie Belle: Me too!\nApple Bloom: Me three!\nFluttershy: [sigh]\nScootaloo: Okay, now what can we do?\nApple Bloom: Oh! How about Cutie Mark Crusader coal miners?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Yeah!\nFluttershy: No!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Awwww!\nFluttershy: I mean, it's time for bed, don't you think? Aren't you excited to get all toasty and warm in your snuggly-wuggly widdle beds?\nApple Bloom: Snuggly-wuggly? But we have more crusadin' to do!\nScootaloo: We've got plans!\nSweetie Belle: And capes!\nFluttershy: Um, okay, um. Maybe the crusading can wait until morning? When it's light? And not so... dark?\n\nApple Bloom: How are we gonna find our special talent in our sleep?\nFluttershy: [puffs] Maybe you'll have a lovely little dream about your special talent.\nScootaloo: But we're not even tired!\nFluttershy: How about I sing you a lullaby?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Mm-hmm, yeah!\nFluttershy: [clears throat]\n\n[Fluttershy]\nHush now, quiet now\nIt's time to lay your sleepy head\nHush now, quiet now\nIt's time to go to bed\nSweetie Belle: I know this one!\nFluttershy: Oh, how wonderful!

Yay!\n[rush of air, more chicken clucking]\nFluttershy: No, I don't think that's a\u2014 ah, come back! Please!\n[Cutie Mark Crusaders giggling, more chicken flapping and squawking]\nFluttershy: Come on, girls, the chickens are fine\u2014 oh, girls, um... girls!\n[chickens flapping and clucking]\nFluttershy: Come on, in you go.\n[eerie music]\nFluttershy: There's some good chickens. Okay, you three. Isn't it about time you got into bed?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: But\u2014\nFluttershy: Please?\n\nOw!\n\nFluttershy: So, no more crusading for tonight, all right?\nScootaloo: Yes, Fluttershy!\nSweetie Belle: We promise, Fluttershy!\nApple Bloom: Good night, Fluttershy!\nFluttershy: Okay, good night.\nSweetie Belle: Okay, so what kind of crusading do we do next?\nApple Bloom: There's not much we can do from this room... unless we become Cutie Mark Crusader cottage cleaners.\nSweetie Belle: N-no, thanks.\nApple Bloom: Well, we have to think of somethin'. We can't just waste this opportunity to find out what our special talents are. Hey, girls! Look! Some of the chickens may have escaped!\nSweetie Belle: Into the forest!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [whispering] Cutie Mark Crusaders chicken rescuers are go!\n\nFluttershy: [sigh] It really wasn't that hard ... I mean, all I needed to do was just show them who's in charge. Nothing's gonna get past Fluttershy! Good with animals, good with kids.\n\n[tearing fabric]\nScootaloo: [whispering] Wait up!\n\nFluttershy: Mmm, peace and quiet. [gasps] Too quiet. [gasps] Girls? Girls? Elizabeak! She's missing! Girls?! [gasps] Oh, no! They must have gone looking for my missing chicken! Which means... they must have gone into... [gasp] [gulp] The Everfree Forest!\n\nFluttershy: Those girls have really done it this time! They've really bitten off more than they can chew! Oh, just like me! I never should have offered to watch them. [deep breath]\n\nApple Bloom: Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick! Brawck, bawk-bawk-bawk, brawck!\nScootaloo: What are you doing?\nApple Bloom: Callin' for the chicken!\nScootaloo: That is not how you call a chicken.\nApple Bloom: Oh, and you know how to call a chicken?\nScootaloo: I know that's not the way.\nApple Bloom: Then show me.\nScootaloo: I don't have to show you!\nApple Bloom: You're just chicken!\nScootaloo: Am not!\nApple Bloom: Oh, wait, now I know how to call a chicken! Scootaloo! Scoot-scootalooooo!\nScootaloo: That's so funny I forgot to laugh.\nApple Bloom: You also forgot how to call a chicken!\nScootaloo: Why, you...\nApple Bloom: [blows raspberry]\nSweetie Belle: Come on, guys, we're not gonna find the chicken or our cutie marks by arguing.\nApple Bloom: Maybe that's our special talent. Arguin'!\nScootaloo: Is not!\nApple Bloom: Is too!\nScootaloo: Is not!\nApple Bloom: Is too! Anything yet?\nScootaloo: Nope.\nApple Bloom: Darn.\nScootaloo and Apple Bloom: [giggle]\n[wind blows]\nApple Bloom: Heeeere, chick-chick-chick-chick, baaawk, bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk, b-baaaaawk!\n\nFluttershy: [whispering] Girls?

I-Is that you? Oh, Twilight, it is you. Thank goodness you're here. I need your help. The girls are out here somewhere, and I'm afraid that they're\u2014 [gasps] Oh! What's happened to you? [scream]\n[thud]\nFluttershy: Oh, no! If you've been turned to stone, it must mean\u2014 oh! Oh no, the girls! Don't move. I'll be back for you. Girls!\n\nScootaloo: Is not!\nApple Bloom: Is too!\nScootaloo: Is not!\nApple Bloom: Is too!\nSweetie Belle: Girls! Our special talent is not arguing. Besides, what would the cutie mark of somepony whose talent is arguing even look like?\nFluttershy: Girls? Girls?\nSweetie Belle: Fluttershy?\nFluttershy: Girls! Thank goodness I found you!\nApple Bloom: Fluttershy, what\u2014\nFluttershy: Girls, we have to leave the forest at once!\nSweetie Belle: But... we haven't found the chicken yet!\nFluttershy: There's no time for that. There's a cockatrice on the loose!\nApple Bloom: A cocka-what now?\nFluttershy: A cockatrice! It's a frightening creature with the head of a chicken and the body of a snake. Now, come on!\nScootaloo: The head of a chicken and the body of a snake? That doesn't sound scary, that sounds silly!\nApple Bloom: Why, if I ever saw one of them cockathingies face-to-face, I'd laugh at how silly it was.\nFluttershy: No! Never look one in the eye!\n[chicken clucking]\nFluttershy: If you look a cockatrice in the eye\u2014\nApple Bloom: The chicken!\nFluttershy: Girls! Wait!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!\n[chicken clucking]\n[growling]\nSweetie Belle: There he is!\nScootaloo: Two chickens?\nApple Bloom: I thought only one escaped!\nSweetie Belle: Grab them both!\n[chicken clucking]\nCockatrice:[roar]\n[chicken clucking]\n[thud]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [scream]\n[thump]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [gasp]\nFluttershy: See?

Behind me, now!\nCockatrice: [squawking and roaring]\nFluttershy: You! Just who do you think you are, going around turning others into stone?\nCockatrice: [dismayed squawk]\nFluttershy: You should be ashamed of yourself. I have a mind to find your mother and tell her what you've been up to, young man. Now you go over there, and turn Elizabeak and my friend Twilight back to normal, and don't ever let me catch you doing this again. Do you understand me?\nCockatrice: [dismayed squawking]\nFluttershy: Are you girls all right? I was so worried!\nScootaloo: Yeah, fine!\nSweetie Belle: Thanks to that stare of yours.\nScootaloo: You're like the queen of stares. You're the\u2014\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Stare Master!\nSweetie Belle: We're sorry we snuck out of the house and into the forest.\nApple Bloom: Yeah. We'll listen to you from now on.\nScootaloo: We promise.\nFluttershy: Oh, you do, do you? Well, you better, or I'll give you... the Stare!\nFluttershy and Cutie Mark Crusaders: [giggling]\nTwilight Sparkle: What... what happened?\n[chicken squawking]\n\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [giggling]\nFluttershy: And that's when it brought you back from stone.\nTwilight Sparkle: This is gonna make quite a letter to the princess. I was wrong about you. You certainly do know how to handle those girls.\nFluttershy: Oh, I wouldn't go that far.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmm? How so?\nFluttershy: I assumed that I'd be just as good with kids as I am with animals. Boy, was I wrong. I really learned the hard way not to bite off more than I could chew.\nTwilight Sparkle: You and Rarity both. Good morning, Rarity.\nFluttershy: Did you finish all those capes?\nRarity: [sigh] Just delivered them. I have to admit, if you hadn't come along, I might not have. Thanks again.\nFluttershy: Won't you stay for some tea?\nRarity: I really must get back to the shop and clean up. Girls! Get your things. Time to go. Girls!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [giggling, talking]\nRarity: Girls! Time to\u2014 Girls! Your things! Girls! It's time to\u2014 Girls!\nFluttershy: Allow me. [clears throat] Girls?\nApple Bloom: Yes, Fluttershy.\nScootaloo: You called?\nFluttershy: Go and get your things. Rarity is here to see you home.\nSweetie Belle: Of course, Fluttershy, right away!\nRarity: Ah, huh, ah, how did you... how did you do that?\nFluttershy: I guess I'm just as good with kids as I am with animals.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Thank you, Fluttershy! Bye! Thank you, Stare Master!\nRarity: Ah, uh, speaking of which, I could use your help with Opal.\nFluttershy: Of course. How about later today?\nOpalescence: [yowls]\nRarity: How about now?

[silence] Well, don't thank me all at once. This was my clubhouse when I was your age. Sure it hasn't been used in a while, but it's empty and on a secluded, private part of the farm. And it's all yours. It just needs a little, uh... TLC.\nScootaloo: TLC as in Tender Loving Care or Totally Lost Cause?\nApple Bloom: Applejack!

No way I'm singing in front of a crowd. Twilight said to do something we like to do, and I'd like to be like my big sister, and she's a designer.\nScootaloo: Fine then. You can do the costumes and the scenery.\nApple Bloom: And Scootaloo, you're great in maneuvers on your scooter. So you should do the choreography. Y'know, all those dance moves.\nScootaloo: Nah.

What are you doing?\nApple Bloom: Oh, I feel like I have four left feet. I can't even spin right.\nScootaloo: Don't be silly. You just gotta keep your head forward until the very last minute, like this. See? Easy-peasy. You just gotta practice a bunch, that's all.\nApple Bloom: Wow! That does look easy. Thanks. Okay. Let's try this again. Oh! Ouch! Ow. I'm okay!\nScootaloo: Keep practicing!\nApple Bloom: Will do.\n\n[discordant piano notes]\nScootaloo: We fight the fight, walk the walk.

Did you just come up with that now?\nSweetie Belle: Yeah... kind of.\nScootaloo: Thanks, I'm totally using that.\nSweetie Belle: Oh no!\n\nThere is nothing that we fear\nWe'll have to figure out what we'll do next\n'Til our cutie marks are here\n\n[sewing machine whirring]\nSweetie Belle: One, two, three, four, five?

You know, ponies only have four legs.\nSweetie Belle: [moan] I'll never be a designer like my sister Rarity.\nApple Bloom: Hey, it's no big deal. Why don't you use the dress form? It'll help you with your patterns and help you put all the pieces in the right places.\nSweetie Belle: Oh, is that what that's for?\nApple Bloom: Uh... maybe you should also clean your paintbrush between each color.\nSweetie Belle: Oh, I was wondering why all the colors looked like mud.\nApple Bloom: You're not using power tools, are you?\n\nApplejack: The talent show is just around the corner. I wonder how the fillies are doin'.\nApple Bloom: Oh! Sorry, Scootaloo.\nScootaloo: That's okay. Ugh!\nSweetie Belle: Oops! Sorry, Scootaloo. Ouch!\nScootaloo: Oh, my bad, Sweetie Belle. Let's sing the chorus again!\nApplejack: Well, gosh. Sure wasn't expectin' that.\nApple Bloom: I think that sounded pretty good.\nSweetie Belle: Me too. You think we're ready?\nScootaloo: Ready as we'll ever be. Hey! Did you see us practicing?\nApplejack: Uh... yeah.\nApple Bloom: Well? How'd we do? How'd we do?\nApplejack: Uh...\nScootaloo: Speechless! See, girls? I told you that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna leave them speechless.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Yay!\nApplejack: \"Speechless\" is right.\n\n[crowd chattering]\nSnips: ...And, on the count of three, this rabbit will disappear, and something tasty will reappear in its place.

Now for our next act, we have Sunny Daze and Peachy Pie reciting their favorite poem... on roller skates!\nSweetie Belle: Break a leg!\nApple Bloom: Sweetie Belle! What a thing to say!\nSweetie Belle: No, no, no. You see, in the theater it's considered bad luck to say \"good luck\". So you say \"break a leg\" instead.\nTwilight Sparkle: My little ponies! How are you doing?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Nervous...\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't worry. You're gonna be amazing. Remember, just stick to what you know best. I can't wait to hear you sing, Sweetie Belle.\nSweetie Belle: Why does everypony always think I'm gonna sing?\nScootaloo: Actually, Twilight Sparkle, I'm the main singer tonight.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh?\nApple Bloom: And I'm the main dancer.

We know why.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh? Tell me. I'd love to make a special report to the Princess.\nSweetie Belle: Well, maybe we were trying too hard.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes?

I make it a point to know all of the up-and-coming designers and Clothes Horse magazine simply raved about you.\nRarity: Oh my stars. If I'm dreaming, do not wake me up. How may I help you, Miss Shores?\nSapphire Shores: Oh please, call me Sapphire.\nRarity: [giggle] How may I help you, Sapphire?\nSapphire Shores: Well, as I'm sure you know, I'll be touring all of Equestria with my latest concert, Sapphire Shores' Ziegfilly Follies, so I need to look seeensational! Ow!\nRarity: I have just what you need. Sapphire Shores, prepare yourself for the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance de la haute couture. I used every last diamond I found on this one garment.\nSapphire Shores: [gasp] And it is spectacular! I'll take it.\nRarity: Really?\nSapphire Shores: Oh yes, and five more, each done up in a different jewel.\nRarity: Beg pardon?\nSapphire Shores: Costume changes.\nRarity: [faints]\nSapphire Shores: [chuckle] Yes, I do have that effect on ponies.\n\n[theme song]\n\nSpike: Oh my gosh! Sapphire Shores! The pony of pop! She is awesome! I mean, she's gorgeous and talented and \u2014 heh... and not even half the pony you are. I mean, you're ten times more gorgeous and talented and\u2014\nRarity: Spike, a lady is never jealous.\nSpike: Eh, of course not. But were you totally flipping out or what?!\nRarity: Ladies do not \"flip out\", Spike. However, I was quite in awe. Oh, I need to find more jewels than ever before to decorate her costumes. Oh, aha!\nSpike: Did you find some?\nRarity: Yes, Spike! Right there!\nSpike: Ooooo! You look so delicious...\nRarity: Spike! I promised I'd give you gems to snack on, but we need to collect more first or I'll never be able to make these outfits for Sapphire.\nSpike: Hm... I will miss you, my sweets.\nRarity: Come along, Spike. We have many jewels to find.\nSpike: At your service, milady.\n\nRarity: Spike!\n\n[jackhammer sounds]\n\nSpike: [licks lips]\nRarity: You've been very patient today, Spike, and for that you get the finest reward.

Oh well, that explains your fine taste in jewelry. I mean I-I-I know that diamonds are a girl's best friend and now I know that they're a dog's best friend too, ha ha ha. So, um, [cough] you're out hunting for gems as well?\nRover: Yes. We hunt.\nRarity: Uh... we?\nRover: We hunt for gems. But you are a better hunter.

Rarity?\nRarity: Unhand me this instant, you ruffians. Stop! Put me down, you thugs! You brutes!\nSpike: [gasp] Rarity!\nRarity: Spike! Ah, dirt! [shrieks] Spike!\nSpike: Which, what, where?\nRarity: Save me...!\nSpike: Nooooooooooo!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, can you breathe now?\nSpike: Yes... [pant] I think so.\nTwilight Sparkle: Good. Now tell us what you know.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah. 'Cause all you said earlier was...\n\nSpike: [pant] Aaaah! Rarity... woods... jewels... dogs... hole... taken... Save her!\n\nApplejack: Not a whole lot to go on there, sport.\nSpike: Sorry. Rarity and I were in the woods looking for jewels when these creepy guys showed up.\nTwilight Sparkle: Creepy guys?\nSpike: They called themselves the Diamond Dogs. They grabbed Rarity and disappeared down a hole in the ground.\nApplejack: Well, this sounds mighty easy. Just take us to that there hole and we'll save Rarity.\nMain cast sans Rarity: [gasp]\nPinkie Pie: Holy moly, that's a lotta holeys.\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on, girls! Let's get started. Hello?\nFido: [growl]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp] Puh!\nRainbow Dash: Yuck! Ugh!\nPinkie Pie: [squeal]\nSpike: Puh!\nTwilight Sparkle: Quick! We gotta get down one before they're all filled up.\nFluttershy: Oh! Oh my. Oh, oh!\nApplejack: We can't muscle through it!\nRainbow Dash: We'll see about that. [gasp]\nApplejack: Whew.

Whatever shall I do? Ah! Dirt, dirt! Get away, dirt! Oh! Make it stop, make it stop! Ah! Filthy, disgusting dirt. It stings, it burns. Help! Oh, somepony save me, save me!\n\nApplejack: We gotta save her.\nFluttershy: But they blocked up all the holes.\nApplejack: Don't mean we can't dig 'em out.

Oof!\nRainbow Dash: Get 'em!\nApplejack: [grunting] [gasp]\nPinkie Pie: Whoooaaa!\nRainbow Dash: Come on!\nMain cast sans Rarity: [grunting and panting]\nFluttershy: All those scary monsters popping up everywhere.

I knew you would save me!\nSir Spike: Nothing could stop me, milady.\nLady Rarity: Ohohohoh, Spike. You are my... hero. [smooch]\nSir Spike: Mmmmmm...\n\nApplejack: Hoho there, lover boy.\nSpike: Whoa! Whoa whoa whoawhoawhoa... I got a bite! I got a bite!\nApplejack: Hold on there, little fella.\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack!\nRainbow Dash: Twilight!\nFluttershy: Oh my goodness, oh my goodness...\nPinkie Pie: Wait for me!\nFluttershy: Oh!\nPinkie Pie: Whee!\nSpike: [yelps]\nMain cast sans Rarity: [yelping]\nSpike: [yelps]\nMain cast sans Rarity: [yelping]\nPinkie Pie: Whee!

Now we can finally save Rarity!\nTwilight Sparkle: Um... which way do we go?\nSpike: Nooooooooooo!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: All these tunnels... how are we ever gonna find Rarity?\nApplejack: Guess we're just gonna have to start going down them one by one.\nRainbow Dash: That could take forever! There's gotta be way to narrow it down.\nSpike: I know! I bet they've taken Rarity down the tunnel with the most gems.\nTwilight Sparkle: But Spike, Rarity is the only one who knows how to find gems.\nSpike: No, Twilight. You can! You can copy Rarity's gem-finding spell.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh my gosh! You're right! Rarity showed me how she did it a while back. If I can just remember...\nSpike: That's it. You did it, Twilight! Come on! We're coming, Rarity. We'll save you. Just hold on.\n\nRarity: Oh please, Diamond Dogs. Please let me go.\nSpot: No!\nFido: You're our precious little pony.\nRover: Forever! Muhahahaha!\nRarity: But whatever do you want from me?\nRover: Gemsss!\nSpot: Yes! The gems. The jewels.\nFido: Find them! Find them all!\nRarity: Oh! Is that all? There. A lovely pocket of jewels are right there. Now, if you'd be so kind as to show me the exit?\nRover: Good! [laugh] Now, dig them up, pony.\nRarity: What? But you said you wanted me to find the gems.\nSpot: Yes! Find and then dig.\nRarity: Dig?\nFido: Yes. Dig.\nRarity: Ohh... [grunting]\nFido: What are you doing? We said dig!\nRarity: Forgive me, but prior to you so rudely dragging me into your dirt pit, I had a pony-pedi and I am not about to chip a hoof because you dislike my style of digging. [grunting]\nRover: Oh, for goodness\u2014 Fine! Just stop. Stop! Dig, dogs! Dig! And fast.\nMook dogs: [barking]\nFido: She won't dig, she pulls.\nRarity: I beg your pardon, but what, pray tell, are you doing?\nFido: Others will dig. You will haul the wagon.\nSpot: Prrrecious pony-pedi will be preserved.\nRarity: Well, somebody certainly needs proper nail care. When was the last time you two had a manicure? You're scratching up my coat with those jagged things!\nRover: Please be quiet!\nRarity: Good heavens, what is that smell?\nRover: Smeeeeeell?\nRarity: Ah, mystery solved. It's your breath.\nRover: Enough! Search, pony!\nRarity: Well, since you insist... but I must say the working conditions in here are simply dreadful. Musty and damp, it's going to wreak havoc on my mane. And this air is stifling, suffocating. And when I try to take a deep breath, the stench of all you dogs makes me nauseated.\n[crash]\nRarity: You look and smell like you haven't bathed in weeks. Have you never heard of soap? You could all do with a good round of soap and water. Oh water, oh water, I'm terribly thirsty. Could I please have some water?\nSpot: Good gracious, I can't take this anymore. Be quiet, pony!\nRarity: And that's another thing. I would appreciate if you stopped calling me \"pony\". I am a lady and I wish to be addressed as such. So you may call me \"Miss\" or \"Rarity\" or \"Miss Rarity\".\nRover: Enough! Your whining! It-it-it hurts!\nRarity: Whining? I am not whining. I am complaining. Do you want to hear whining? Thiiis iiis whiiining! Oooh, this harness is too tiiight! It's going to chafe. Can't you loosen it? Oooh, it hurts and it's sooo ruuusty! Why didn't you clean it first? It's gonna leave a staaain! And the wagon's getting heeeavy, why do I have to pull it?!\nSpot: Aaah! Make it stop!\nRover: Stop whining!\nRarity: But I thought you wanted whiiining!\nRover: Geh! We'll do anything, pony! Oh, uh, uh, we'll do anything, \"Miss Rarity\". [nervous laughter]\nRarity: [dreamily] Anything?\n\nRarity: [sigh] This water is hardly sparkling. But I suppose it will have to do.\nRover: [panting] Wait! Why are we doing this?\nSpot: To stop the awful noises from the pony's mouth, remember? [whines]\nRover: Yes, yes, I know. This is ridiculous! Letting a pony order us around. What are we? Mice or dogs?\nFido and Spot: Mi... dogs?\nRover: Dogs do not pull. Ponies pull. Let her make the awful noises.\nRarity: What are you doing? Hey, you spilled my drink. Oh! [whining] Not sooo tiiight!\nRover: Ha! Make the noises all you want. But move while you make them. Hyah, mule!\nRarity: Did you just call me a... mule?\nRover: Ehh...\nRarity: Mules are ugly. Are you saying that I too am ugly? [cries]\nSpot: What are these noises?\nRarity: He called me ugly!\nRover: No! Mule! I said mule!\nRarity: An old ugly mule! And it's true! Just look at me. I used to be beautiful, but, but nooow...\nFido: No, no! You're still beautiful, po... uh, Miss Rarity.\nRarity: You're just saying that!\nSpot: No, you're still pretty and... and...\nRover: Oh, uh, uh, nice. Yeah.\nRarity: I don't believe you! You never liked me! [wails]\nRover: Oh, I've had just about enough of this!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: We're getting close. I can feel it.\nRarity: [distant crying]\nSpike: It's coming from down here. Come on!\nRainbow Dash: She must be in there. Let's go!\nMook dog: More workhorses.\nApplejack: Hoh, doggies. If you can take this bull by the horns, you better be ready for a ride. Come on, ponies! Kick 'em up, kick 'em out. Buck 'em up, buck 'em down.\nMook dogs: [yowling]\nApplejack: Yeehaw! Get along, little doggies!\n[crashing and clattering]\nSpike: I'm coming for you, milady. Hi-ho, Twilight! Away!\nTwilight Sparkle: And just what do you think you're doing?\nSpike: Please, Twilight. Just give me this.\nTwilight Sparkle: Eh... fine. [neighs]\n[crash]\nSpike: Lady Rarity, I'm here to save you!\nDiamond Dogs: [Save us! Please, save us! Make it stop! Please!]\nTwilight Sparkle: Excuse me?\nSpot: So picky.\nFido: And critical.\nSpot: She won't stop talking.\nFido: And crying.\nRover: We, uh, give her back. Yes.\nSpike: Rarity! You're safe!\nRarity: Why, yes. Hello, girls. You arrived just in time to assist me.\nApplejack: Assist you with what?\nRarity: With those.\nSpike: You're letting her leave with all these... jewels?\nRover: Yes. Take them. And her with them.\nSpot: Please!\n\nPinkie Pie: I can't believe you found all these gems!\nRainbow Dash: Heh. I can't believe you tricked all those dogs.\nRarity: Just because I'm a lady doesn't mean I cannot handle myself in a sticky situation. I had them wrapped around my hoof the entire time.\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't wait to write to Princess Celestia to tell her what you taught me today.\nRarity: Me? What did I teach you?\nTwilight Sparkle: Just because somepony is ladylike doesn't make her weak. In fact, by using her wits, a seemingly defenseless pony can be the one who outsmarts and outshines them all.\nSpike: Hm... \"outshines\" is right. Now you have enough gems to cover Sapphire Shores' costumes.\nRarity: Not if you eat them all, Spike.\n[laughter]\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nRarity: So sorry, Fluttershy.

You are the best friend a pony could ever have!\n\nFluttershy: [sigh] What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.\nRarity: Isn't it?

She's going to want to see attitude and pizzazz.\nFluttershy: A-a-attitude and, um... pizzazz.\nRarity: More light! It has to catch the sequins just so or the whole outfit is just a disaster.

Just don't forget us little ponies when you become the most famous designer in all of Equestria.\nRarity: Never.\nPhoto Finish: Put me down here. Oh, nonononononono. The model should be in something simple! Something inspired by... the nature!\nRarity: That's just what I was thinking. Um... give me a moment and I'll, uh, put a little something together.\nPhoto Finish: Yes... that will not be necessary.\nRarity: But... but... how are you going to help me \"shine across Equestria\" if I don't design something new for these pictures?\nPhoto Finish: I am not going to help you shine across Equestria. I am going to help her shine. She is my star. You! Go!\nRarity: [gasp]\n\nFluttershy: I can't, Rarity.\nRarity: Oh, but you must, Fluttershy. Photo Finish wants to make you a star. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. I know we were both hoping it would be my lifetime, but nonetheless you can't throw away this chance. You must do this for me. You must. You must! You must!\nPhoto Finish: Floottershy! It is time to make... the magics! Oh, wunderbar! You are like a delicate flower. So much more alluring without all those sparkles und feathers.\n\nPinkie Pie: How'd it go? How'd it go?\nRarity: It didn't. Photo Finish wanted to work with Fluttershy, not me.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Rarity. I'm so sorry. Is there anything we can do?\nRarity: I just vant to be alone right now.\nSpike: You heard her. She vants to be... alone. What? I didn't think she meant alone alone.\n\nPhoto Finish: Too much blush. Not enough. Too much. Not enough. Perfect.\nFluttershy: Ah... Aaah... [tiny sneeze]\nPhoto Finish: Oh, yes! Even her schneezes are graceful. Now go! How do you feel? Excited? Overjoyed? Thrilled beyond your wildest dreams?\nFluttershy: N... nervous.\nPhoto Finish: Nervous? Dun be ridiculous. You're only facing a large crowd of ponies who will be watching your every move and silently judging you.\n[music]\nPhoto Finish: Your cue! Now go!\nBackground voice: No seriously...\n[ponies chattering]\n[cameras clicking]\nFluttershy: You can't let Rarity down. You must do this. You must. You must. You must.\n[ponies cheering]\nLyrica Lilac: So graceful.\nRoyal Ribbon: So lovely.\nHoity Toity: So perfect for my new advertisement.\n\nRarity: [gasp] [growl]\n\nShoeshine: It's Fluttershy!\n[ponies shouting excitedly]\n\n[bell rings]\nRarity: Wow. Look how popular you are. I'm so excited for you. You must be having the best time ever.\nFluttershy: Oh, yes. Best time ever...\nPhoto Finish: Floottershy! I have been looking for you everywhere. We have the thing at the place.\nFluttershy: I'll see you at the spa? Our usual time?\nRarity: Of course! I can't wait to hear all about the... \"thing at the place\".\nFluttershy: [yelp]\nRarity: I'm the one who should be mobbed by strangers wherever I go.\n[bell rings]\nRarity: Welcome to Carousel Boutique!\nSweetie Drops: Is she still here? We heard Fluttershy was here.\nRarity: Sorry. You just missed her. But you're still in luck. I'm having a huge sale on some of my best designs.\nSweetie Drops: And you are...?\nRarity: Rarity, of course.\nSweetie Drops: Never heard of you.\n\nPhoto Finish: Obviously I, Photo Finish, am thwilled to have found her.\nFluttershy: Photo Finish?\nPhoto Finish: She's a natural in front of the camera.\nFluttershy: Um... Photo Finish?\nPhoto Finish: I only need to point and shoot, and I capture... the magics!\n[ponies: Over here! Fluttershy, over here!]\nFluttershy: Photo Finish, I'm so sorry to interrupt. It's just that I'm running late.\nPhoto Finish: [gasp] How could I have forgotten?! Your appearance at the ballet opening! Everypony who is anypony will be there.\nFluttershy: Oh, actually I'm supposed to be meeting my friend...\nPhoto Finish: We go!\n\nRarity: My hooves are getting positively pruney, I've been waiting here so long. Obviously Fluttershy's just too busy with her new career to spend time with her best friend.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sure she just got tied up.\nRarity: Of course she did. She's a big bright shining star! I wish that star would burn out.\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity! Fluttershy is your friend.\nRarity: I know, I know. And I should be happy for her, but instead I'm just... jealous! Oh, please promise you won't tell her I feel this way. Please, please, pleasepleaseplease!\nTwilight Sparkle: You have my word. Losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend.\nPinkie Pie: Forever!\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow! You look great!\nRarity: Fluttershy may be the one who's famous, but that doesn't mean I have to stop looking fabulous.\nFluttershy: Rarity! I'm so sorry I'm... Oh no. She's already gone, isn't she?\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry.\nFluttershy: Oh, I can't believe this. I am so frustrated, I could just scream. [inhales] [squeak]\nTwilight Sparkle: Feel better?\nFluttershy: [sighs] No. Can I tell you something?\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course.\nFluttershy: You promise not to tell Rarity?\nTwilight Sparkle: I swear.\nFluttershy: Pinkie Pie Swear?\nTwilight Sparkle: Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my [poke] Ooowwwww!\nFluttershy: I don't like being a model. No, I hate being a model. All this attention is awful, just awful. And I'm only doing it because Rarity told me I must. I must! I must! [sigh] I must...\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, really? Well... If you wanna know the truth, Rarity...\nFluttershy: Oh, what were you about to say?\nPinkie Pie: [quietly] Forever!\nTwilight Sparkle: Nothing!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I was just thinking. If you really don't like being a model, you could always quit.\nFluttershy: Oh, no. I could never do such a thing. Rarity would be devastated.\nTwilight Sparkle: But Rarity told me... [gasp]\n[eerie music]\nPinkie Pie: [chomp] Mmm... Juicy!\nTwilight Sparkle: Uhhhhhh!\nFluttershy: Oh, if only all these ponies didn't like me so much. Photo Finish wouldn't want me to model anymore. She'd find somepony else with... the magic!\nTwilight Sparkle: I guess you're right. [pause] You're right. You're right, you're right, you're right!\nGala Appleby: It's Fluttershy!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't you see? On her own, Fluttershy could never do something unattractive. But if I used my magic to help her do something unattractive at her next fashion show, no one will ever want her to model again. And if Fluttershy no longer has to be a model, Rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her. And I'll no longer have to keep their secrets! It's the perfect plan! You can't tell anyone about it. Promise me you won't tell anyone?\nPinkie Pie: [miming]\nTwilight Sparkle: So you do promise or you don't?\nPinkie Pie: Uh, yes! Obviously, that's why I zipped my mouth closed, then locked it with a key, then dug a hole, then buried the key, then built a house on top of the hole where I buried the key, then moved into the house on top of the hole. [squee]\nTwilight Sparkle: Obviously.\n\n[ponies chattering]\nFluttershy: You really think it'll work?\nTwilight Sparkle: They love you for being you. So all I have to do is make you not be you. Just leave it to me.\n[music]\nRarity: Guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about.\nFluttershy: Oof!\n[music stops]\n[ponies gasp]\nFluttershy: [gasp] Ooh... Aah!\n[ponies gasping]\nFluttershy: [barks]\nRarity: Oh no.\nFluttershy: [brays]\n[ponies gasp]\nGolden Harvest: Get her off the stage!\nLemon Hearts: She's an embarrassment to all things fashion!\nPhoto Finish: I, Photo Finish, have made a terrible mistake!\n[ponies booing]\nRarity: Bravo! I say bravo!\nLyrica Lilac: Bravo? Who could possibly say bravo to that horrid display?\nRarity: Such attitude! Such pizzazz! She's invented an entirely new kind of modeling! Bravo!\nLyrica Lilac: Who is saying these things?\nRoyal Ribbon: It's her. The unicorn in the gorgeous cape and headdress.\nLyrica Lilac: Now that is a pony who clearly knows a thing or two about fashion. Well, if that fabulous pony likes it, then I do too! Bravo!\n[ponies cheering]\nFluttershy: [moans]\n\nFluttershy: This is awful. Just awful! Somehow I've become more popular than ever. Oh, I'm so frustrated I could just kick something!\n[vase wobbles]\nFluttershy: If only Rarity didn't want me to be a model so badly.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh! But Rarity...!\nRarity: Fluttershy! Are you all right?\nFluttershy: I'm great! I'm a super famous fashion model. Why wouldn't I be great?\nTwilight Sparkle: Because you ha...!\nRarity: Out there on the runway, everyone was turning on you and... Oh... Oh, Fluttershy. It's so awful. I wanted them to.\nFluttershy: You did?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course she did! Because...!\nRarity: I'm jealous! I wanted all the attention. And instead it was going to you. I even started hoping that you would do something silly so your modeling career would be over. But then, when it started happening, all I could think was how could I want you to fail at something you love so much?\nTwilight Sparkle: But... Fluttershy doesn't... Ugh!\nFluttershy: Love? Oh, Rarity. I hate being a model.\nRarity: You do?\nFluttershy: More than anything.\nRarity: Then why did you keep doing it?\nFluttershy: I was afraid if I quit, you'd be mad at me for not wanting to... \"shine all over Equestria\".\nRarity: And I thought if I told you how jealous I was of your success, you'd think I was a terrible friend.\nFluttershy: Never!\nRarity: All this time!\nFluttershy: If we'd just told each other the truth.\nRarity: I promise never to keep my feelings in secret again.\nFluttershy: Me too.\nFluttershy and Rarity: Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye. [laughs]\nPhoto Finish: You were brilliant. Brilliant! I've already got six photo shoots lined up for tomorrow alone.\nFluttershy: I'm sorry, Photo Finish, but I don't think I'll be able to make any of them.\nPhoto Finish: Whaaat?\nFluttershy and Rarity: We go!\nPhoto Finish: Vat has just happened?\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike has a crush on Rarity!\nPinkie Pie: [sigh] And you were doing so well.\n\nFluttershy: Now this is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.\nRarity: Isn't it, though?\nTwilight Sparkle: Dear Princess Celestia,\nBeing a good friend means being able to keep a secret. But you should never be afraid to share your true feelings with a good friend. Did you get all that, Spike?\nSpike: No. I did not. I still can't believe you told someone about my secret feelings for Rarity.\nTwilight Sparkle: You're right. That was wrong of me, and I'm very sorry.\nSpike: Apology accepted.\nTwilight Sparkle: Now will you take down my letter to Princess Celestia?\nSpike: I would love to. But... I'm a little busy at the moment.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sigh]\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nApplejack: And that's when the yellow birdie thought to himself, \"Hmm.

We are outta here!\nLittle Strongheart: Wait! Please accept my apologies for what happened on the train. We didn't mean for anyone to be hurt.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, right.\nLittle Strongheart: We only wanted the tree. The settler ponies have overtaken the land and have planted an orchard all over it! Because of their thoughtlessness, we can no longer run over our traditional stampeding grounds.\nRainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie: Huh?\nSpike: I think it's time they met Chief Thunderhooves.\n\nChief Thunderhooves: Hmmh. We have a long and winding stampeding trail that we have run upon for many generations.

It is a sacred tradition to run the path every year. But this year, these... settler ponies, these... [snort] Appleloosans!

Right, Rainbow Dash?\nRainbow Dash: Hmph...\nLittle Strongheart: The ponies refused to move their trees, so we are stuck here, and it is not fair!\nSpike: See, Rainbow Dash? They had a good reason to\u2013\nRainbow Dash: Huh... Ah!\n[buffalo gasp]\nRainbow Dash: I'll say they had a good reason! C'mon. We have some apple-pickin' Appleloosans to talk to!\n\nRarity: Ow! [groaning] Gently, please!\nApplejack: Sorry, Rarity, but our friends are out there and we have ta' be ready for a long hike into buffalo territory if we're gonna save 'em!

We're so glad you're safe.\n[indistinct \"Oh, there you are!\" \"Thank goodness!\"]\nTwilight Sparkle: How did you escape from the buffalo?\nPinkie Pie: We didn't!\n[ponies gasp]\nRainbow Dash: We promised the buffalo a chance to talk.\nApplejack: Oh, yeah? 'Bout what?\nRainbow Dash: We brought our new pal Little Strongheart here to explain to the Appleloosans why they should move the apple trees off buffalo land.\nBraeburn: That information would be quite help\u2013\nApplejack: That's weird. 'Cause my cousin Braeburn here wants to explain to the buffalo why they should let the apple trees stay.\nLittle Strongheart: That would be a useful thing to\u2013\nRainbow Dash: The land is theirs! You planted the trees not knowing that. Honest mistake. Now, you just gotta move 'em, that's all.\nBraeburn: Well... heh...\nApplejack: They busted their rumps here! An' now they're supposed ta bust their rumps again, just 'cause some buffalo won't stampede someplace else?\nRainbow Dash: Plant the trees somewhere else!\nApplejack: Where?! It's the only flatland around these parts!\nRainbow Dash: The buffalo had it first!\nApplejack: The settler ponies need it to live!\nRainbow Dash: Come on, Applejack!\nApplejack: [over Rainbow Dash] You're bein' unreasonable!\nRainbow Dash: [over Applejack] I put my hoof down!\nTwilight Sparkle: Look!

Maybe I shouldn't go.\n[trumpet fanfare]\nFluttershy: Aah! It's starting! I'm missing it!\nAngel: [sigh]\nFluttershy: Oh, thanks, Angel. I mean, if you hadn't reminded me, I might have not remembered, and then I wouldn't be there, and everypony would be wondering where I was and... Oh, right. I'm late.\n[door rattles]\nFluttershy: Oh, okay then. See you later.\n\n[theme song]\n\nRainbow Dash: So... what do I have to do to get to be one of the Princess's royal guards, anyway? Is the pay good? Hellooo? Anybody home? [babbles] Wah-wah! [babbles] Ooh, you're good. [pause] Too good. I'm bored.\nFluttershy: Phew. Made it. [gasp]\nGuard 1: Halt!\nGuard 2: Who goes there?\nFluttershy: [gulp] No one. Never mind. I'll go home.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's all right, sirs. She's on the list.\nFluttershy: Thanks, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm so glad you could make it, Fluttershy. It wouldn't be the same without you.\n[ding!]\nMr. Cake: How's everypony doing? Good? Good.\nMrs. Cake: Anything else we can get for you, dearies...? Ooh, I-I mean, esteemed guests.\nPrincess Celestia: Everything is fine, Mr. and Mrs. Cake.\nFluttershy: Sorry I'm late. I had to finish taking care of a patient first.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, you and your tender loving care of little animals. I just know Princess Celestia is gonna love that about you. I mean, I hope she will... I mean, of course she will!\nFluttershy: Wow, Twilight. I thought I was the only one who got nervous at social gatherings.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, it's not that. I just want the princess to approve of my friends.\nFluttershy: But she's met us all before.\nTwilight Sparkle: And read about you in my letters. But this is the first time she's spent any real time with you. I want everypony to make a good impression.\nFluttershy: Well, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. Besides, it's just a casual get-together, right?\nRarity: Don't touch me! Watch the dress! Careful, you're gonna spill that on me! Oh, oh, that looks delicious. What is it? Oh, does it stain?! Keep it away from me!\nFluttershy: Or... perhaps not that casual.\nApplejack: Uh... which is the salad and which is the appetizer again? And which am I supposed to eat first? Oh, never mind. I'm not hungry.\nFluttershy: It's okay, Twilight. So our friends' manners aren't perfect. I doubt the princess will even notice.\nPinkie Pie: [giggles] Whoo-hoo! Cupcakes, candies and pies, oh my! Oooh! Chocolate fountainy goodness! [munching] You gonna eat that?! [munching]\nMrs. Cake: [gasp]\nPinkie Pie: Hey!\nMr. Cake: A thousand pardons, Your Majesty.\nPrincess Celestia: That's quite all right, thank you. [sips]\nMrs. Cake: Empty teacup at 4 o'clock!\nMr. Cake: Uh, I see it, honey bun!\nPrincess Celestia: Oh, um... thank you.\nMr. Cake: Not at all, Your Highness.\nPrincess Celestia: [sips] Thank you again.\nMrs. Cake: Oh, but of course, Your Majesty.\nPrincess Celestia: [sips] [sips] [sips] Gotcha!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh...\nPrincess Celestia: And what about you, dear? Fluttershy, is it?\nFluttershy: Me? Oh yes, Your Highness.\nPrincess Celestia: I understand from Twilight Sparkle's letters that you enjoy tending to the needs of woodland creatures.\nFluttershy: Yes, I love to take care of animals.\nPrincess Celestia: As do I. As Princess, I care deeply about all creatures, great and small.\n[cough]\nPrincess Celestia: Nothing means more to me than the well-being of all my subjects.\nPhilomena: [coughs and hacks]\nPrincess Celestia: Ah, Philomena, my pet. You're awake. Do say hello to our gracious hosts.\nPhilomena: [coughs and hacks]\nFluttershy: Oh... my.\nPrincess Celestia: She is quite a sight, isn't she?\nFluttershy: I... I... I've never seen anything like it.\nPhilomena: [cough]\nGuard: [clears throat] [whisper]\nPrincess Celestia: Really? Well, if I must... I'm sorry, everypony. I'm afraid I have to cut the party short. The mayor has requested an audience with me. Royal duty calls. Thank you for a wonderful time. It's been a joy getting to know you all better.\nApplejack: Phew! Now I can eat someth'n! I'm starved! Oh...\nPinkie Pie: [whooping and giggling]\nRarity: Stay right where you are. All I want is a clear path to the exit. Nobody move and my dress won't get hurt! Stay back! Back, I say!\nTwilight Sparkle: [sigh] Well, Spike, I don't know for sure how things went with the princess, but at least no big disasters happened.\n\nFluttershy: Oh, you poor little thing. How did you ever get in such bad condition? Don't you worry, Philomena. I'll nurse you back to health. As a favor to the princess, who's obviously just far too busy to care for you properly.\nPhilomena: [cough]\nFluttershy: I'm sure the princess will appreciate the help. Oh my. We'd better get you to bed right away. There.\n[steam whistle]\nFluttershy: [gasp]\nPhilomena: [shivering]\nFluttershy: [gasp]\n[steam whistles and shivering]\n[thermometer glass shatters]\nFluttershy: This is far worse than I thought. What you need is some medicine. Stat!\nPhilomena: [cough]\n\nFluttershy: Here you go, Philomena. This will fix you right up.\nPhilomena: [sniff]\nFluttershy: Doctor Fluttershy expected that.\n[jackhammer sounds]\nFluttershy: Always works. [gasp] Uh... almost always.\nPhilomena: [cough]\n\nFluttershy: There's nothing like homemade soup to cure what ails you. Come on now. You're not gonna get better if you don't cooperate. Mmm... see? It's delicious. Good and good for you. Here comes the choo-choo train. Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo-whoo!\n[splash]\nFluttershy: Oh dear. Don't worry, Philomena. I know what'll make you feel better. Wait right here. I have just the thing.\nPhilomena: [cough]\n\nFluttershy: Look, Philomena. I brought a fellow feathered friend by to cheer you up. Hummingway here was sick once too, but he let me help him and got better in no time. Didn't you, boy?\nHummingway: [humming \"Mm-hmm!\"]\nFluttershy: Say hello to your new friend Philomena.\nHummingway: [humming happily]\nFluttershy: Aw, look. I think he likes you. [vocalizes My Little Pony theme]\nHummingway: [hums My Little Pony theme]\nFluttershy: Your turn now, Philomena. Go ahead. You can do it. [vocalizes My Little Pony theme]\nPhilomena: [heaves]\nFluttershy: Oh! Um... good try?\n\nFluttershy: I know what'll clear up that tickle in your throat. A humidifier. [deep breath] Refreshing. How's that feeling now for you, Philomena? Better?\nPhilomena: [deep breath] [cough]\nFluttershy: Oh... that's okay. I know lots of other ways to take care of you. Don't worry. You're gonna get better. How about...\n\nFluttershy: Aromatherapy?\nPhilomena: [sneeze]\n\nFluttershy: Warm bath?\n\nFluttershy: Ointment?\n\nFluttershy: Scalpel. Surgical tape. Feathers.\nPhilomena: [cough]\nFluttershy: Oh, Philomena. I thought it would be easy to nurse you back to health. I've tried everything I know. And look at you. You're worse than ever.\n[knocking]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hi, Fluttershy! I just wanted to drop by and say thank you so very much for making such a good impression on the princess today... [gasp] What is Celestia's pet doing here?!\nFluttershy: I couldn't leave the poor thing there. She needed my help.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh no. Nonononononono! This is bad.\nFluttershy: How could I just walk away and not do anything?\nTwilight Sparkle: But... but... she doesn't belong to you!\nFluttershy: I had to do something.\nTwilight Sparkle: Without telling anypony?! Without asking permission?!\nFluttershy: But...\nPhilomena: [cough]\nTwilight Sparkle: I know you had good intentions, but you have got to return the princess's pet!\nFluttershy: But...\nPhilomena: [deep breath]\nFluttershy: [sigh] You're right. Okay, let's...\nPhilomena: [cough]\nFluttershy: ...go.\nTwilight Sparkle: If we hurry, we can put her back before anypony even realizes she's missing. [gasp]\n\nGuard 1: We were told we could find Twilight Sparkle here.\nGuard 2: We regret to inform you, miss, that the royal pet has gone missing.\nTwilight Sparkle: Really? You don't say! [nervous laughter]\nPhilomena: [cough]\nTwilight Sparkle: [cough]\nPhilomena: [cough]\nTwilight Sparkle: [cough]\nTwilight Sparkle and Fluttershy: [excessive coughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: It's that dry night air?\nFluttershy: But it's daytime.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well... day air's even drier. You guards better be on your way if you're gonna find the princess's missing pet. Philomena, was it? Thank you ever so much for keeping me in the loop. Bye! [pants] Phew... What are you doing?!\nFluttershy: Going to return Philomena, remember?\nTwilight Sparkle: We can't now!\nFluttershy: Why not?\nTwilight Sparkle: You have no idea what the princess is gonna do if she finds you're the one who took her pet, do you?!\nFluttershy: Do you?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well... no. But it can't be anything good. She might banish you from Equestria. Or throw you in a dungeon. Or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon in the place that she banishes you to!\nFluttershy: You really think the princess would do that?\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay. Granted that probably won't happen, but do you wanna take any chances?\nFluttershy: All that really matters to me is that poor little Philomena here gets well.\nPhilomena: [cough]\nTwilight Sparkle: That's very noble of you. I'll write to you when you're banished. Unless I'm banished to somewhere there's no post office. Then you'll have to write to me. Deal?\nFluttershy: Please, Twilight. You just have to help me get Philomena healthy and then we can return her to the princess. And everything will be fine.\nTwilight Sparkle: Did you give her any kind of medicine?\nFluttershy: I tried to, but she wouldn't take it.\nTwilight Sparkle: [groan] Then you have to make her take it. You can't be such a pushover, Fluttershy! You need to show this patient who's the boss. Make her straighten up and fly right!\nFluttershy: She can't fly.\nTwilight Sparkle: No excuses! Done. Okay, what else?\nFluttershy: Uh... well, she keeps pulling her feathers off. The ones that haven't fallen out yet from all her coughing, I mean.\nTwilight Sparkle: There you go.\nPhilomena: [groaning]\nFluttershy: I don't think she likes it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Tough love, baby. You want her to get well, don't you?\nFluttershy: Of course, but...\nTwilight Sparkle: Next!\nFluttershy: Well, she desperately needs some bed rest, but I can't get her to stay put.\nTwilight Sparkle: One step ahead of you.\n\nPhilomena: [growling]\nFluttershy: It's for your own good, Philomena, I promise. Please, just relax and try to get some sleep.\nTwilight Sparkle: What's this soup over here? Smells delicious.\nFluttershy: I made it for Philomena. But she wouldn't eat it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, she'll eat it, all right.\nPhilomena: [screams]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey! Where are you going?\nFluttershy: No! Philomena! Come back!\n[Benny Hill-esque music]\n\nRainbow Dash: What are you two doing? Are you having a race? Oh, can I play? One, two, three, go!\nPinkie Pie: [munching]\nFluttershy: Excuse me!\nPinkie Pie: Hi!\nTwilight Sparkle: Beg your pardon!\nRarity: Put me down!\nApplejack: What in tarnation?!\nFluttershy: Sorry, but we've gotta find...\nGuard: The princess's pet bird!\nPhilomena: [cough]\nFluttershy: Philomena, come down from there! You'll hurt yourself!\nPhilomena: [cough, exaggerated death rattle] [repeats]\nFluttershy: I'll catch you!\nPinkie Pie: [gasp]\n[Philomena bursts into flames]\nFluttershy: [gasp]\nMain cast sans Fluttershy: [gasp]\nFluttershy: [whimpers]\nPrincess Celestia: What is going on here? Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, your Majesty, there's been a terrible accident.\nFluttershy: It's all my fault.\nTwilight Sparkle: No, Princess. Fluttershy didn't know any better. It was my fault.\nFluttershy: I'm the one who did it.\nTwilight Sparkle: But you were only trying to help.\nFluttershy: Some help I was.\nTwilight Sparkle: Will ya let me do this? She'll go easier on me.\nFluttershy: But it's my fault!\nTwilight Sparkle: No, it's my fault!\nPinkie Pie: No, it's my fault! Wait, what are we talking about?\nFluttershy: Thanks for trying to protect me, Twilight, but... Princess Celestia, I'm the one who took your pet bird. I really was only trying to help the poor little thing. Then I was gonna bring it right back to you, honest. So, if you wanna banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to, then that's what I deserve.\nPrincess Celestia: Oh, stop fooling around, Philomena. You're scaring everypony.\n[ponies gasp and awe]\nFluttershy: I don't understand! What is that thing? What happened to Philomena?\nPrincess Celestia: This is Philomena. She's quite a sight, as I said. But nothing unusual for a phoenix. Isn't that right, Philomena?\nPhilomena: [squawks]\nFluttershy: A... A phoenix?\nPrincess Celestia: A phoenix is a majestic and magical bird. While it appears healthy and happy most of the time, every so often it must renew itself by shedding all of its feathers and bursting into flame. [whispering] Rather melodramatic, if you ask me. [normal voice] It then rises from the ashes, fresh as a daisy. All just a normal part of the life cycle of a phoenix. I'm afraid mischievous little Philomena here took the occasion to have a little fun with you, Fluttershy. Say you're sorry, young lady.\nPhilomena: [\"I'm sorry\" sound]\nFluttershy: So... aren't you gonna banish me? Or throw me in a dungeon? Or banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to?\nPrincess Celestia: Of course not, my little pony. Where on Earth would you get such an idea?\nFluttershy: I guess I have some imagination.\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy really did do everything she could to try to take care of Philomena for you.\nPrincess Celestia: And I do appreciate that your heart was in the right place, child. But all you had to do was ask me and I could have told you Philomena was a phoenix and saved you all this trouble.\nFluttershy: I know. I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. Next time I'll ask before taking matters into my own hooves.\nTwilight Sparkle: Should I write you a letter about that lesson, Princess?\nPrincess Celestia: No, that's quite all right. I think I can remember.\nFluttershy: It's beautiful. Thank you, Philomena. No hard feelings.\nRainbow Dash: Hmm... [indistinct whispers] Hey, you know what you should do? You should go over there and tickle them!\n[royal guards laugh]\nRainbow Dash: Yeah!

You know where we can find a cannon at this hour? It's no use! No matter what we try, we always end up without our cutie marks. And, surprisingly often, covered in tree sap.\nSweetie Belle: Maybe we should do something less dangerous, like pillow testing or flower sniffing.\nApple Bloom: This town is full of ponies who have their cutie marks. Why don't we ask them how they did it?\nSweetie Belle: That's a great safe idea.\nScootaloo: Yeah! And we can start with the coolest pony in Ponyville.\nApple Bloom: Applejack!\nSweetie Belle: Rarity!\nScootaloo: Come on, guys, I said \"cool\"! You know who I'm talking about. She's fast.

Fine.\nApplejack: Why, shoot. I was just a little filly. Even littler than y'all.\n\nApplejack: [voiceover] I didn't want to spend my life on a muddy old apple farm. I wanted to live the sophisticated life, like my Aunt n' Uncle Orange. So I set out to try my luck in the big city, Manehattan! The most cosmopolitan city in all of Equestria.\nCount Caesar: Hey! Outta the way, you rube!\nApplejack: [voiceover] I knew I'd find out who I was meant to be in Manehattan.\n\n[knocking]\nYoung Applejack: Aunt Orange! Uncle Orange!

We'll have you acting like a true Manehattanite in no time.\n\nTall Order: And how are you finding good old Manehattan?\nYoung Applejack: Oh, it's simply divine.\nAunt Orange: Very well said, my dear.\nYoung Applejack: Although, I must admit the city noise took some getting used to. Where I'm from, nights are so quiet, you seldom hear a peep until the roosters wake you.\nDane Tee Dove: The... what?\nTall Order: I say, my dear, what in the world is a \"rooster\"?\nYoung Applejack: [voiceover] What's he talking about?

You know, I wouldn't have gotten my cutie mark if it weren't for her.\nScootaloo: Rainbow Dash?! Really?!\nFluttershy: Oh yes.

Come with me and I'll tell you how I got mine!\nScootaloo: [sigh] Why not?\nPinkie Pie: All right!\n\nPinkie Pie: [voiceover] My sisters and I were raised on a rock farm outside of Ponyville.

You're here!\nRainbow Dash: I hear you're looking for my cutie mark story.\nScootaloo: [sigh] You have no idea what I've been through today to hear that story.\nRainbow Dash: It all happened during the race at Flight Camp...\n\nRainbow Dash: [voiceover] ...where I stood alone against all odds to defend Fluttershy's honor.\nYoung Fluttershy: [yelps]\nRainbow Dash: [voiceover] I've never flown like that before! That freedom was unlike anything I've ever felt! The speed, the adrenaline, the wind in my mane... I liked it... a lot!\nYoung Rainbow Dash: Ow!\nYoung Hoops: Ha! Later, Rainbow Crash!\nYoung Rainbow Dash: Hey!\nRainbow Dash: [voiceover] Turns out the only thing I liked more than flying fast... was winning!\n[explosion]\nRainbow Dash: [voiceover] Most people thought that the sonic rainboom was just an old mare's tale. But that day... The day I discovered racing... I proved that the legends were true. I made the impossible happen!\n[Pegasi cheering]\n\nRainbow Dash: And that, little ones, is how you earn a cutie mark.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Whooooaaaa...\nFluttershy: Wait a second. I heard that explosion. And I saw the rainbow too. Rainbow Dash, if you hadn't scared the animals, I never would have learned I could communicate with them and gotten my cutie mark.\nPinkie Pie: I heard that boom! And right afterwards, there was this amazing rainbow that taught me to smile.\nApplejack: When I got my cutie mark, I saw a rainbow that pointed me home. I bet it was your sonic rainboom!\nRarity: There was an explosion I could never explain when I got my cutie mark.\nTwilight Sparkle: This is uncanny! If that explosion didn't happen when it did, I would have blown my entrance exam. Rainbow Dash, I think you helped me earn my cutie mark too!\nRainbow Dash: Whoa!\nPinkie Pie: We all owe our cutie marks to you!\nFluttershy: Do you realize what this means? All of us had a special connection before we even met.\nRarity: We've been BFFs forever and we didn't even know it!\nApplejack: Come here, y'all.\nMane Six: AWWW!!!\nFluttershy: I'm so glad we're friends!\nPinkie Pie: I love you, guys!\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: Awwww...\nScootaloo: Ewwww... Gimme a break. Come on, Crusaders! Maybe we just need to try zip lining again. [sigh]\nFluttershy: Hey. How about a song?\n[cries of approval]\nPinkie Pie: Definitely!\nScootaloo: Nooooo!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Dear Princess Celestia,\nToday I learned something amazing. Everypony everywhere has a special magical connection with her friends, maybe even before she's met them. If you're feeling lonely and you're still searching for your true friends, just look up in the sky. Who knows? Maybe you and your future best friends are all looking at the same rainbow.\nSpike: Gross!

Whoa, whoa, whoa! [sigh] There.\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, did you grab my quill and ink?\nSpike: Check!\nTwilight Sparkle: Scrolls?\nSpike: Check! I've also packed a telescope, apples, bananas, fruit punch, and my freshly baked homemade triple-decker nut-crazy vanilla cream cookies!\nTwilight Sparkle: [giggle] I can see that. Once again you've read my mind, Spike. And that is why you are my number one assistant.\nSpike: I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.\nTwilight Sparkle: That is why you are my number one assistant.\nSpike: Missed that! Huh...?\nTwilight Sparkle: I said... [giggle] Come on, let's get going. Wait! I almost forgot! I wanna bring the \"Astronomical Astronomer's Almanac to All Things Astronomy\".\nSpike: The Astronomo-lomo homono what?\nTwilight Sparkle: You know that really old big blue book on stars, moons, planets, the universe...?\nSpike: Right. Check! Ah... Ahh... Ahhh... Ahhhh...! [sigh] [sneeze]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey! What's taking my number one assistant so long?\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I was sure I put the astronomer's guide back. The book would have helped me identify different planets and stars tonight.\nSpike: Well... maybe someone borrowed it. Besides, you don't need that book. You can already name all the planets and stars, 'cause you're super smart and astronomically awesome!\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks, Spike. You're such a flatterer.\nSpike: Yeah, I'm a sweet talker.\nTwilight Sparkle: And a number one assistant, right?\nSpike: Check!\nRainbow Dash: [munch] [gulp] Wow, Twilight! You're lucky to have such a rad assistant. I wish I had someone to do whatever I told them.\nScootaloo: Ooh! Ooh! Me! Me! Me! I'll do whatever you want, Rainbow Dash!\nRainbow Dash: Oh yeah, pipsqueak? How about taking out the trash?\nScootaloo: Yes ma'am!\nRarity: Do we have Spike to thank again for this amazing spread? Isn't he simply amazing?\nSpike: Oh, come on. [pause] I said come on.\nPinkie Pie: Little Spikey-wikey! Who knew that big ferocious dragon started off so cutesy wootsy?\nRarity: Spike, you are such a little star that I had to make a little bow tie for you.\nSpike: Gosh. You guys are embarrassing me. Stop it. [pause] Twilight, your turn.\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, that's enough.\nSpike: Oh, right. That's enough.\nSweetie Belle: Hey, everypony! The show is starting!\nMain cast and Cutie Mark Crusaders: [Woah! That's amazing! I can't believe it!]\nTwilight Sparkle and Spike: Woah...\nSpike: [yawn] Huh?\n\nMain cast and Cutie Mark Crusaders: [excited chatter]\nPinkie Pie: Mmm. Wow! These cookies are delish!\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike made them. Speaking of, Spike, can you bring us some punch? Spike?\nSpike: [snoring]\nRarity: Oh, poor little thing.\nTwilight Sparkle: Aww...

How about a sunflower smoothie? Grass pancakes?\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, don't worry.\nSpike: But my morning chores...\nTwilight Sparkle: It's okay. Owlowiscious did them for you.\nSpike: Who?\nTwilight Sparkle: He's our new junior assistant. He's gonna help out with your chores so you won't be so tired all the time.\nSpike: Wha... Wh... What do we need a junior assistant for? I'm not tired. I do fine on my own. I don't need sleep, I...\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, don't worry. He's just here to help out a little. Now, I have to go out, so why don't you introduce yourself to Owlowiscious? He's in the library.\nSpike: Worried? Do I look worried? I'm not worried. Who's worried? Hello? Hellooo! Whoa! Dude, that's creepy. Uh... Hi there! I'm Spike. I'm sure Twilight has told you all about me.\nOwlowiscious: Hoo.\nSpike: Uh, Spike? You know, assistant number one?\nOwlowiscious: Hoo?\nSpike: I'm Spike! And who are you? What are you?\nOwlowiscious: Hoo!\nSpike: Who?\nOwlowiscious: Hoo!\nSpike: I thought your name was Owlowiscious!\nOwlowiscious: Hoo?\nSpike: Okay, \"Who\", \"Owlowiscious\", whatever. I'm Spike, okay? Look! All you need to know is that I'm number one and you're number two. Got it?\nOwlowiscious: Hoo?\nSpike: So, a man of mystery, huh? I'm keeping my eye on you! I've got eyes in the back of my head too, you know. [crash] Well, not really, but... you know what I mean!\n[door slams]\nSpike: That bird is out for my job. He wants to be number one. I'll prove to Twilight that I deserve to be number one. Not Freaky Feathers over there. I won't let him have my job if it's the last thing I do!\n\nPinkie Pie: Oh, what a fantastical, flufflicious feathery little friend! I'm... hooked!\nMain cast: [laugh]\nFluttershy: He's just wonderful.\nSpike: [mocking] He's just wonderful. [normal] Uh, yes. Wonderful. He's quite... the charmer.\nRarity: And Owlowiscious is just such a star I just had to make this little bow for you.\nSpike: Grrr!\nApplejack: What's he all saddle sore about?\nRainbow Dash: He's probably just jealous of Owlowiscious.\nFluttershy: Maybe Spike feels threatened or worried that Owlowiscious will replace him?\nTwilight Sparkle: Replace him? Hah! That's crazy! Spike knows he can't be replaced.\n\nSpike: They're trying to replace me! I better step it up and make sure that Twilight and Owlowiscious know that I'm still number one!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey, Spike! Can you fetch me that book called \"Two-headed Myth\u2014\nSpike: ...Mythological Mysteries!\" I know where it is.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks, Owlowiscious. Hey, Spike, no worries. Owlowiscious flew up and got the book for me. Oh, and gee! I guess I need \"Ferrets of Fairyland\" too.\nSpike: Hey! Whoa! Whoa!\nTwilight Sparkle: Climb down from there before you fall.\n[crash]\nSpike: Grrr!\n\n[snap]\nTwilight Sparkle: Shoot!\nSpike: Yes, sir!\nTwilight Sparkle: My last writing quill. It's broken.\nSpike: Never fear! Spike, your number one assistant, is here! [under his breath] Quill... Quill... Where is it? Not here... Quill... Quill, where is it...?\nOwlowiscious: Hoo.\nSpike: Where am I gonna get a quill?\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, wait! Wait!\n\nSpike: But the store is called \"Quills and Sofas\". You only sell two things!\nDavenport: Sorry, Junior. All outta quills until Monday. Need a sofa?\nSpike: [groan]\n\nPinkie Pie: I swore I had one here somewhere. Ah, here it is! A quince!\nSpike: Not a quince. A quill!\nPinkie Pie: Right. A quail? A quilt! A quesadilla? Aha! A quiche!\nSpike: Not a quiche. A quill!\nPinkie Pie: Nope. Sorry. All outta quills.\nSpike: [sigh] Shoot.\n\nSpike: Come on, chicken! Here, chicky-chicky-chicky! Here, chick-chick-chick-chicky! Come here! Ugh! Come here! [grunting] Not the face, not the face! No! Hey! Stop! Quit it!\n\nSpike: [panting] Spike... to the rescue.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Spike. I was calling out for you when you were turning this place upside down. Owlowiscious gave me one of his feathers to use as a quill.\nSpike: That's just great. Perfect! Sweet! I think I'll just, uh... finish up the rest of my chores! Or did Owlowiscious already do them?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, no no. There are quite a lot of them.\nSpike: Well, that's fine. Because I can just stay up all night and finish\u2013 [snoring]\nTwilight Sparkle: Poor Spike. He'll come around. He's genuinely a good little guy.\n\nSpike: Huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike. What is this? You said this book was missing. Well, Owlowiscious found it right where it belongs, but like this. How did it get this way?\nSpike: Uh... Well, um... You see, I... I just didn't wanna disappoint you and, uh... Have you ever seen a dragon sneeze?\nTwilight Sparkle: I've seen a dragon lie. I'm very disappointed in you, Spike.\nSpike: [to Owlowiscious] You set me up! Well, two can play that game.\nOwlowiscious: Hoo!\nSpike: Not \"who\"! Two! Urgh!\n\nSpike: Owlowiscious is out to take my place, I just know it! I've gotta stop him. But how?\n[mouse squeaking]\nSpike: Ah... Muahahaha!\n\nRarity: Come along, Opal. Let's hurry up and get to Fluttershy's tea party.\nSpike: So lifelike. And when Twilight discovers it shredded up on her floor, she'll think mouse-eating Owlowiscious is to blame. And I'll be number one... again! Muhahaha!\n\nSpike: [evil laugh]\u00a0That poor little field mouse! Torn to pieces! It must have been Owlowiscious! You know, since owls eat, you know, mice. What a terrible, terrible bird! He must be punished! Right?\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike! I don't know what upsets me more\u2014that you deliberately tried to set up Owlowiscious, or that you actually thought this pathetic attempt would work! You've let your jealousy get the best of you, Spike. I am truly disappointed. This is not the Spike I know and love.\nSpike: She... She doesn't love me anymore.\n\nSpike: Twilight hates me. I'm cold, hungry, tired and lonely. Could it get any worse?\n[thunder]\n[rain falls]\nSpike: I guess that's a yes.\u00a0Hello? Hello?\n[thunder]\nSpike: What is that?\u00a0If this is what running away is all about, I never wanna go home! Gems! Mmm... Woohoo!\n\nSpike: [hiccup] Even if my tummy's full, the rest of me is still empty. I miss Twilight and the pony gang. But she doesn't love me anymore. So, I'm better off here, all by myself. Wow. Seems to be getting warmer. The steam is great for my complexion, but it's sure getting hot in here.\nGreen dragon: What are you doing in my cave? And why are you eating my gems?\nSpike: Uh, heyah bro! I didn't know this was your cave. And I didn't know these were your gems, but... we're cool, right?\nGreen dragon: [growl]\nSpike: Whoa, whoa! Hey... We're like brothers, you know? I mean, you're a dragon, I'm a dragon... It's us against the world, right?\nGreen dragon: [roar]\nSpike: [yelp] You don't scare me! So you're big.\nGreen dragon: [growl]\nSpike: Really big. And your claws are super sharp. Tail... extra spiky. But, uh... You don't scare me! Ha! How'd you like that?\nGreen dragon: [breathes fire]\nSpike: Uh... I'd love to stay, but gotta go! See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya! Aah!\nOwlowiscious: Hoo-hoo!\nGreen dragon: [roar] [wail]\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike! Over here!\nSpike: Am I glad to see you!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hurry! Hop on! It's too dark! I can't see!\nOwlowiscious: Hoo! Hoo-hoo!\nGreen dragon: [roar]\nSpike: [sigh]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [pants] Spike. We were so worried about you. I was so worried about you. Why did you run away?\nSpike: I thought you didn't need me anymore. And that you didn't love me anymore.\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike. Sure, I was disappointed, but you are my number one assistant! And friend. And you always will be. It's just that sometimes I need some help at night. I can't ask you to stay up late. You're a baby dragon and you need your rest. Owls are nocturnal. So I asked Owlowiscious to help. But not to take your place. No one could ever replace you, Spike. Not even when you are being a jealous numbskull.\nSpike: I'm sorry, Twilight. I never should have been so jealous.\nTwilight Sparkle: And I'm sorry too, Spike. I should have been more sensitive.\nSpike: And Owlowiscious... I know now that you weren't out to take my job. Forgive me?\nOwlowiscious: Hoo?\nSpike: Me. Forgive me, Spike.\nOwlowiscious: Hoo!\nTwilight Sparkle: [giggle] He forgives you, Spike.\nSpike: Hey! How did you guys know where I was?\nTwilight Sparkle: It was your ketchup-covered feet. Owlowiscious discovered your footprints and we followed them all the way to the cave.\nSpike: Oh yeah, the ketchup. It looked pretty real though, didn't it? Uh... [nervous giggle]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I know Princess Celestia will wanna read about what happened today...\nSpike: I'm ready when you are.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey, Spike. Why don't you write to Princess Celestia? And tell her what you've learned?\nSpike: Really? Why, that's a big responsibility!\nTwilight Sparkle: I know. But nothing my number one assistant can't handle.\nSpike: Dear Princess Celestia,\nThis is Spike, writing to you about my adventures. This week I've learned that being jealous and telling lies gets you nowhere in friendship. I also learned that there's plenty of love for every friend to share. So from here on out, I promise, that I, Spike, will... [drops asleep]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Spike.\nOwlowiscious: Hoo?\nTwilight Sparkle: Who? Spike! You kno... Ohhhh...

I know just about everypony around here.\nFluttershy: He's... a bear.\nPinkie Pie: A bear?\nRainbow Dash: Yup! He's a bear all right, and he'll be pretty upset if we don't get over to his house soon.\nPinkie Pie: Wait! There's a bear around here who lives in a house?\nFluttershy: It's, uh, really more of a cave.\nRainbow Dash: But he's fixed up the place so much, it feels like a house.\nFluttershy: And, uh, he wants us to look after his house... uh, cave... while he's, uh...\nRainbow Dash: A-at the beach!\nPinkie Pie: He's vacationing at the beach?\nRainbow Dash: Yup!

Sure Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to house-sit for that vacationing bear, but what are the chances all my other friends would have plans this afternoon too? Rarity has to wash her hair? Applejack has to pick apples? Twilight is behind on her studies and has to hit the books? The more I think about it, the more those are starting to sound like...

Fixin' up the whole thing, top to bottom... uh, lots of construction goin' on in there right now.\nRainbow Dash: [whispering] You heard her! Construction!\n[ponies mimicking noises of various construction tools]\nApplejack: Yup! Construction! That's my story, and I'm stickin' to it.

It's all secrets and lies with those ponies! They're up to something, Gummy! Something they don't want me to know about! Well, I'm gonna know about it! I'm gonna know about it big time! And I know just who's gonna tell me all about it. Tell me all about it big time!\n\nSpike: Wow! Nice spread!\nPinkie Pie: It's all yours, Spike. All you have to do is talk.\nSpike: That's it? Oh, you got it. Okay... uh, beautiful weather we're having, eh? I love a sunny spring day, don't you? The birds chirpin' and the flowers bloomin'.\nPinkie Pie: No, no, no. Talk about our friends.\nSpike: Oh, okay. Let's see, there's Twilight Sparkle. She's a unicorn. Good with magic. A real brainiac. And then you got Rarity. Total knockout. Twilight seems to think I don't even have a chance with her, but... eh, what does she know? Let's see. There's... there's Fluttershy, a Pegasus who's afraid of heights. Heh, what's up with that?\nPinkie Pie: Grr! No! You're not understanding me! I want you to confess!\nSpike: Confess?\nPinkie Pie: Confess!\nSpike: I'm the one who spilled juice all over Twilight's copy of \"Magical Mysteries and Practical Potions\"!\nPinkie Pie: And?\nSpike: And I'm the one who used up all the hot water in Ponyville yesterday when I took a seven-hour bubble bath!\nPinkie Pie: Aaand?\nSpike: And sometimes... when no one's around... I do this: Lookin' good, Spike! Lookin' real good!\nPinkie Pie: No! No! No! No!\nSpike: W-What do you wanna hear? Tell me what you want me to say, and I'll say it!\nPinkie Pie: Tell me that my friends are all lying to me and avoiding me because they don't like my parties and they don't want to be my friends anymore! [panting]\nSpike: Your friends are all lying to you and avoiding you 'cause they don't like your parties and they don't want to be your friends anymore!\nPinkie Pie: Aha! I knew it! [balloon deflating noise] Oh no, my friends don't like my parties and they don't want to be my friends anymore.\nSpike: Uh... so...

I say \"losers\" isn't strong enough.\nPinkie Pie: Well, it was pretty rude...\nMadame le Flour: Pretty rude? It was downright deespicable!\nPinkie Pie: It was, wasn't it?\nMr. Turnip: If I were you, I wouldn't speak to them ever again.\nPinkie Pie: You know what? I'm not gonna speak to them ever again. And I'm not gonna invite them to another party as long as I live! They don't deserve to be invited to my parties. [plink] Not after the way they've been acting.\nMadame le Flour: [clapping] Deeespicable!\nSir Lintsalot: Such losers!\nMadame le Flour: Yes, zat's right.\nPinkie Pie [as Mr. Turnip]: Well done.\nPinkie Pie [as Sir Lintsalot]: Yeah!\nPinkie Pie [as Rocky]: You show 'em!\n[knocking]\nPinkie Pie: Who could that be?\nRainbow Dash: Hey there, Pinkie Pie!

Excited?! Why would I be excited to attend my own farewell party?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Farewell party?\nPinkie Pie: Yes! You don't like me anymore, so you decided to kick me out of the group and throw a great, big party to celebrate! A \"Farewell to Pinkie Pie\" party!\nApplejack: Why in the world would you think we didn't like you anymore, sugarcube?\nPinkie Pie: Why? Why? Why?! Because you've been lying to me and avoiding me all day, that's why!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, yeah! Because we wanted your party to be a surprise.\nRarity: We'd been planning this party for such a long time, we had to make excuses for why we couldn't attend Gummy's party so that we could get everything ready for yours.\nTwilight Sparkle: If this is a farewell party, why does the cake I picked up from Sugarcube Corner say \"Happy Birthday, Pinkie Pie\"?\nPinkie Pie: [squeak] Because it's my birthday! Ooh, how could I have forgotten my own birthday?\nRest of main cast: [relieved sigh]\nPinkie Pie: And you like me so much you decided to throw me a surprise party!\nRarity: That's what we've been trying to tell you, darling.\nPinkie Pie: You girls are the best friends ever! How could I have ever doubted you?\nTwilight Sparkle: It's okay, Pinkie Pie. It could have happened to any of us.\nRainbow Dash: Uh-huh! It sure would.\nFluttershy: Don't worry about it.\nRainbow Dash: I'm just glad I haven't been replaced by a bucket of turnips.\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh?\nRainbow Dash: You don't wanna know.\nApplejack: All right, girls! Enough of this gab. Let's party!\n[music]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Dear Princess Celestia,\nI am writing to you from the most delightful party. I'm not only having a great time with my friends, but also was given the opportunity to learn a valuable lesson about friendship. Always expect the best from your friends, and never assume the worst. Rest assured that a good friend always has your best interests at heart.\n\nYour faithful student,\nTwilight Sparkle\n\nPinkie Pie: You girls wouldn't mind if we celebrated Gummy's after-birthday party too, would you? His party was cut short, and he's pretty upset about it.\nFluttershy: Oh, definitely.\nRarity: Aww, he was upset?\nApplejack: Uh-huh, sure!\nRainbow Dash: For Gummy, yeah!\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah, why not?

The Grand Galloping Gala is always awful.\nTwilight Sparkle: It is?\nPrincess Celestia: That is why I was thrilled you were all attending. I was hoping you could liven things up a bit. And while the evening may not have gone as you planned, I'm sure you'll agree that in the end it didn't turn out so bad for this group of friends.\nTwilight Sparkle: You're right, Princess. Friends have a way of making even the worst of times into something pretty great.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! Hanging out with friends!\nFluttershy: Talking!\nPinkie Pie: Laughing!\nSpike: You mean doing exactly what I wanted to do the whole time?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, Spike.

That one over there represents friendship. Alright, my little ponies. This one represents victory.\nScootaloo: How cool would it be to have that for a cutie mark?\nApple Bloom: Cool, if you were actually victoryful at somethin'.\nSweetie Belle: That's not a word!\nScootaloo: What are you, a dictionary?\nCheerilee: Girls! Now this is a really interesting statue. What do you notice about it?\nApple Bloom: It's got an\u00a0eagle claw!\nScootaloo: And a lion paw!\nSweetie Belle: And a snake tail!\nCheerilee: This creature is called a draconequus. He has the head of a pony and a body made up of all sorts of things. What do you suppose that represents?\nApple Bloom: Confusion!\nSweetie Belle: Evil!\nScootaloo: Chaos!\nSweetie Belle: It's not chaos, you dodo!\nScootaloo: Don't call me things I don't know the meaning of! And it is too chaos!\nSweetie Belle: Is not!\nApple Bloom: You're both wrong!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [grunting]\n[pulsating]\nCheerilee: Actually, in a way, you're all right. This statue represents discord,\u00a0which means a lack of harmony between ponies. In fact, you three have demonstrated discord so well that you're each going to write me an essay explaining it.\nGroup: [laughter]\nCheerilee: Now let's go, and I don't want anymore fighting.\nApple Bloom: It's confusion!\nSweetie Belle: Evil!\nScootaloo: Chaos!\n[stone cracking]\nDiscord: [laughter]\n\n[theme song]\n\nRainbow Dash: Come back here, you! Gotcha! Eww, what is this? Cotton candy?\n[thunder rumbles]\n[drip]\nRainbow Dash: Wait a second! It's not supposed to rain until tomorrow. You can't just\u2013\n[rain falling]\nRainbow Dash: You did.\n\nRainbow Dash: Hey, I didn't tell you to go anywhere!\nApplejack: Rainbow Dash, what's goin'\u00a0on with this rain? I mean chocolate milk? I mean chocolate milk rain?!\nRainbow Dash: There's crazy weather all over Equestria! Cloudsdale is getting soaked by a major cola storm right now! But don't worry. I'm not leaving you until I get control of Ponyville!\n[popping]\nPinkie Pie: Why would you wanna stop this? [slurp]\nRarity: Ahem. I heard about your troubles, Applejack, and I came to see if there's anything I can do without getting wet. Or dirty. Or out from under my umbrella.\n[wood creaking]\nApplejack: Fluttershy! Do somethin'!\nFluttershy: Now, Angel, you really shouldn't\u2013 No! It's not possible! I must be seeing things!\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't worry, everyone. I've learned a new spell that'll fix everything. My fail-safe spell... failed. What do we do?\nSpike: Uh, give up?\nRarity: Spike, Twilight will come up with something.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmm, time for plan B. Rainbow, can you corral all those clouds in one corner of the sky? Applejack, I need you to bring those high-strung storm clouds down to Earth.\nPinkie Pie: Hey, what happened?\nTwilight Sparkle: [whispers]\nFluttershy: Oh dear. I hope none of the animals see these delicious chocolate-filled cotton candy clouds. I'd hate to have to share them.\nPinkie Pie: You and me both, sister! Hey!\nApplejack: And when y'all are done with that, feel free to have some popcorn for dessert.\nTwilight Sparkle: You see, Spike? You should never give up. There's nothing we can't overcome if we all work together.\nSpike: [burp]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp] Come on, girls. Princess Celestia wants to see us all in Canterlot immediately!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Celestia, we came as fast as we could!\nPrincess Celestia: Thank you, Twilight. Thank you, all.\nTwilight Sparkle: Is this about the weather? And the animals' weird behavior? What's happening out there? Why isn't my magic working? Is there\u2013\nPrincess Celestia: Follow me.\n\nPrincess Celestia: I've called you here for a matter of great importance. It seems an old foe of mine, someone I thought I had defeated long ago, has returned. His name... is Discord.\nFluttershy: [squeal]\nPrincess Celestia: Discord is the mischievous spirit of disharmony. Before my sister and I stood up to him, he ruled Equestria in an eternal state of unrest and unhappiness. Luna and I saw how miserable life was for Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns alike, so after discovering the Elements of Harmony, we combined our powers and rose up against him, turning him to stone.\nRainbow Dash: Alright, Princess!\nPrincess Celestia: I thought the spell we cast would keep him contained forever, but since Luna and I are no longer connected to the Elements, the spell has been broken.\nTwilight Sparkle: No longer connected?\nPrincess Celestia: This is Canterlot Tower, where the Elements are kept inside since all of you recovered them. I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony once again and stop Discord before he thrusts all of Equestria into eternal chaos.\nTwilight Sparkle: But why us? Why don't you\u2013\nPinkie Pie: Hey, look! We're famous!\nPrincess Celestia: You six showed the full potential of the Elements by harnessing the magic of your friendship to beat a mighty foe. Although Luna and I once wielded the Elements, it is you who now control their power, and it is you who must defeat Discord!\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Celestia, you can count on\u2013\nPinkie Pie: Hold on a second! Eternal chaos comes with chocolate rain, you guys. Chocolate rain!\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't listen to her, Princess. We'd be honored to use the Elements of Harmony again.\nRarity: Ooh. You can keep the Elements. I'll take that case!\nPrincess Celestia: Have no fear, ponies. I have total confidence that you will be able to defeat Discord with these!\nAll: [gasp]\nPinkie Pie: Oh, well. If anyone needs me, I'll be outside in the chocolate puddles with a giant swizzle straw.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: The Elements! They're gone!\nPrincess Celestia: That chamber is protected by a powerful spell that only I can break! This doesn't make sense!\nDiscord: [laughter] Make sense? Oh, what fun is there in making sense?\nPrincess Celestia: Discord... Show yourself!\nDiscord: [chuckling] Did you miss me, Celestia? I missed you. It's quite lonely being encased in stone, but you wouldn't know that, would you, because I don't turn ponies into stone.\nPrincess Celestia: Enough! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony?\nDiscord: Oh, I just borrowed them for a teensy little while. [snap]\nPrincess Celestia: You'll never get away with this, Discord!\nDiscord: Oh, I'd forgotten how grim you can be, Celestia. It's really quite boring.\nRainbow Dash: Hey! Nopony insults the Princess!\n[smack]\nDiscord: Oh, you must be Rainbow Dash, famed for her loyalty, the Element of Harmony you represent.\nRainbow Dash: That's right! I'll always be loyal to the Princess!\nDiscord: We'll see about that.\nRarity: I can't believe we're wasting our time talking to a tacky window.\nDiscord: The beautiful Rarity, representing the element of generosity, if I'm not mistaken?\nApplejack: So you know who we are, big deal.\nDiscord: Oh, I know much more than that, honest Applejack.\nTwilight Sparkle: You seem to know our strengths too.\nDiscord: Yes, Twilight Sparkle, and yours is the most powerful and elusive element, magic. Fluttershy's is kindness and Pinkie Pie's is a personal favorite of mine - laughter. [laughter]\nPinkie Pie: [snickering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie: [laughing] He's standing on your head!\nPrincess Celestia: Stop stalling, Discord! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony?\nDiscord: Oh, so boring, Celestia. Really? Fine, I'll tell you, but I'll only tell you my way. To retrieve your missing Elements, just make sense of this change of events. Twists and turns are my master plan. Then find the Elements back where you began. [laughing]\nFluttershy: Can we go home now?\nApplejack: What do you reckon he meant? Twists and turns and endin'\u00a0back where we started?\nTwilight Sparkle: Twists and turns... twists and turns... twists and turns! That's it! I bet Discord hid the Elements in the palace labyrinth!\nPrincess Celestia: Good luck, my little ponies. The fate of Equestria is in your hooves.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks, Princess. We won't let you down.\nDiscord: [laughing]\n\nMane Six: [gasp]\nFluttershy: W-We have to go in there?\nRainbow Dash: Nope! Dopey Discord forgot about these babies! I'll just do a quick flyover and we'll have the Elements in no time. My wings!\nFluttershy: [scream]\nTwilight Sparkle and Rarity: Your horn! My horn! Ahhh!\nDiscord: [laughing] You\u2013You should see the looks on your faces. Priceless! [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Give us our wings and horns back!\nDiscord: You'll get them back in good time. I simply took them to ensure there's no cheating. You see, this is the first rule of our game: no flying, and no magic.\nRainbow Dash: The first rule?\nDiscord: The second rule is everypony has to play or the game is over,\u00a0and I win. Good luck, everypony! [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Never fear, girls. We have each other!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! Like Twilight said, there's nothing we can't overcome if we all stick together!\nTwilight Sparkle: Alright, girls, let's do this!\nMane Six: Together! [screaming]\nTwilight Sparkle: Stay calm, girls! Everypony head to the middle as fast as you can, and we'll regroup there!\nRainbow Dash: Moving out!\nRarity: See you in the center.\nApplejack: Yee-haw!\nPinkie Pie: See you guys there!\nFluttershy: [gasping] What's that? Who's there? Girls!\n\nApplejack: What in tarnation? Where am I?\nApples: [laughing]\nApplejack: Who are y'all?\nRed apples: The keepers of the grove of truth. You may ask us...\nLight-red apples: ...one question...\nGreen apples: ...past, future or present.\nRed apples: But be warned...\nLight-red apples: ...that the truth...\nGreen apples: ...may not always be pleasant.\nApplejack: Alright then. I don't trust this place worth a hill of beans, but I've got a really bad feelin' about this feller Discord. What's gonna come of this mission we're on?\nRed apples: For the answer you seek...\nLight-red apples: ...go ahead, take a peek.\nPond Rainbow Dash: I hope I never see you again!\nPond Fluttershy: Me too!\nPond Pinkie Pie: Fine!\nPond Rarity: Fine!\nPond Twilight Sparkle: It's settled then.\nApplejack: No! Our friendship? Over?!\nDiscord: [chuckling]\nApplejack: It can't be true. It just can't!\n\nApplejack: That just can't be the truth.\nLight-red apples: When all the truth does...\nGreen apples: ...is make your heart ache...\nGreen apples and Discord: ...sometimes a lie is easier to take. [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack! Thank goodness! I thought I heard voices over here. Who were you talking to?\nApplejack: I was talkin'\u00a0to... uh... nopony! Nopony whatsoever!\nTwilight Sparkle: What?\nApplejack: Nothing. Come on, uh, we best be going.\nTwilight Sparkle: Did Applejack just...? Come on, Twilight! Applejack wouldn't lie.\n\nPinkie Pie: [whistling]\nBalloons: [sing-song laughter]\nPinkie Pie: [chuckling] Whee! This is the greatest balloon garden I've ever seen! It's the first balloon garden I've ever seen, but still! Wah! [splash]\nBalloons: [laughing]\nPinkie Pie: Hey, what gives?\nDiscord: What's the matter, Pinkie Pie? I thought you appreciated a good laugh.\nPinkie Pie: It's different. They're laughing at me.\nDiscord: It's hardly different. Your friends laugh at you all the time.\nPinkie Pie: My friends laugh with me, not at me.\nDiscord: Oh, really? [laughing]\nPinkie Pie: No! Stop it!\nBalloons: [laughing]\nPinkie Pie: Stop laughing at me!\nDiscord: Oh, poor Pinkie Pie. And here I thought laughter made you happy.\nPinkie Pie: [gravelly] Happy? I don't think so.\n[balloons popping]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you!\nPinkie Pie: Oh you are, huh? Why? Need a good laugh?\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie? What do you suppose has her so upset? It's not like her.\nApplejack: I didn't notice anythin'\u00a0strange about Pinkie.\nTwilight Sparkle: Weird. Better pick up the pace before the stress of this gets the better of all of us.\n\nRarity: I was expecting an audience with the Princess, not outdoor sport. Agh. Oh my...\nDiscord: [laughing] Welcome to your lucky day, Rarity. You've found the one thing in Equestria that could rival my face for sheer beauty. What do you think? You like?\nRarity: Yes... I like very much... No! No, I shan't succumb to such fabulousness. Must... get to the center... to meet... the others. [grunt] Mine!\n\nRarity: Well, Rarity. It took forever, but it was worth it. Who knew three little gemstones would turn out to be this handsome hunk of a diamond? Now to get you home. [grunts]\n[wall crash]\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity! Are we glad to see... Why are you carrying a humongous boulder?\nRarity: What do you mean, \"boulder\"? This big beautiful bedazzling rock is a diamond! And it's all mine. Keep your envious little eyes off it! I found it and it's mine fair and square! [grunting]\n\nFluttershy: [teeth chatter] Okay, I can do this. I can... [scream] Oh, wait a minute... Butterflies? Wait! Don't leave me here!\nButterflies: Fluttershy, looks like you've been left behind by your so-called friends, huh?\nFluttershy: Oh, no. I'm certain they're doing their best to find me.\nButterflies: Well, it must be so upsetting to know how weak and helpless they think you are.\nFluttershy: Not at all. I am weak and helpless and I appreciate their understanding.\nButterflies: Yes... Well, surely it burns you up... I mean, that they're always pointing out your flaws, right?\nFluttershy: Not really. In fact, I think I'm awfully lucky to have friends who want me to be the best I can be.\nDiscord: Oh, for goodness sake! You've been kind for far too long, my dear. Time to be cruel. Arrivederci!\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy! I'm so glad to see a friendly face. This awful labyrinth is getting to everypony.\nApplejack: Grrr...\nPinkie Pie: [blows raspberry]\nFluttershy: Aw, boo-hoo-hoo! Why don't you wave your magic little horn and make everything all right?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh...\nFluttershy: Oh, that's right, you can't. You don't have one.\nTwilight Sparkle: What is happening to my friends?\nApplejack: [laughing]\nPinkie Pie: And what are you laughing at?\nApplejack: Chocolate milk.\nRarity: Little help here!

I know where you live.\n\n[thunder crash]\nRainbow Dash: I've got you now, element.\nDiscord: Oh. I can see why you like these clouds so much. Very plush.\nRainbow Dash: Get off there and put 'em up! Come on! Let's go!\nDiscord: Hey, I'm here to deliver a message.\nRainbow Dash: I've got a message for you too!\nDiscord: Listen closely, this is important. A weighty choice is yours to make:\u00a0the right selection or a big mistake. If a wrong choice you choose to pursue, the foundations of home will crumble without you.\n[thunder] [spinning]\nRainbow Dash: Cloudsdale? Crumble... without me? No!\nDiscord: That box contains your wings. You can take them and leave the game, or you can carry on aimlessly wandering this maze. Your choice.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Must... find... Rainbow Dash. As a team... we're unstoppable. Rainbow Dash won't let us down.\nApplejack: Well, looky there. Rainbow Dash is flying away. She's abandonin' us.\nTwilight Sparkle: Now I know that's a lie. [gasp] How can it be?\n[thunder, cracking]\nDiscord: Well, well, well. Somepony broke the \"no wings; no magic\" rule. [snap] Game's over, my little ponies. You didn't find your precious elements.

I told you that the future of Equestria didn't rest on me making friends. But the opposite is true! The friendships I've made since I've been here are what saved Equestria from Nightmare Moon.

[sigh] I saw a vision of us feudin' and fightin'. I couldn't face the truth, so I started tellin' lies. Can you ever forgive me?\nTwilight Sparkle: I already have. Come on!\n\nFluttershy: Oh no! Twilight, Applejack, I just had the worst dream!\n\nRarity: What do you think you're doing? Get away from my gem! Get away--! [grunting] Let us never speak of this again.\n\nPinkie Pie: [laughter] And I-I turned gray! [giggle] Can you believe it?!\n\nFluttershy: Uh? She's not here.\nTwilight Sparkle: Without Rainbow Dash, we can't use the Elements.\nApplejack: She could be anywhere by now! We're never gonna find her.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah, we will, 'cause she's right there!\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash!\nRainbow Dash: Hey, guys!\nTwilight Sparkle: We've been looking everywhere for you!\nRainbow Dash: That's nice.\nTwilight Sparkle: Discord's still on the loose! We need you to help us defeat him with your element, Loyalty!\nRainbow Dash: Pfft. Loyalty, schmoyalty! Have you guys seen Ponyville? It's a disaster! I'm staying here in Cloudsdale where everything's awesome.\nRarity: How in Equestria can she think that tiny patch of clouds is Cloudsdale?\nApplejack: The same way he got you to think that cheap rock was a bona fide diamond.\nRarity: I thought we agreed never to speak of that again.\nTwilight Sparkle: Time for Plan B.\n\nRainbow Dash: [snoring]\nTwilight Sparkle: [whispering] Okay, Fluttershy, you grab Rainbow Dash and hold her down. Applejack will lower me down from this rope so I can cast the memory spell on her.\nFluttershy: Got it!\nRainbow Dash: [snoring]\nFluttershy: Um...I'm just wondering if it's okay if I hold you down against your will for a little bit?\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh...\nRainbow Dash: Nice try! Ponyville's your problem, not mine.\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on, Fluttershy, we've got to catch her. Hyah! Applejack!\nRarity and Pinkie Pie: WHOA!\nRarity: PINKIE! You were supposed to secure the ROPE!\nPinkie Pie: Oops.\nApplejack: Rarity, Pinkie, hold on! Y'all are slowing her down!\nRarity: Oh, Fluttershy, would you be a dear and FLY FASTER, please?\nFluttershy: [whimper] I can't!\nTwilight Sparkle: If you can't catch her, Discord wins!\nFluttershy: That big... dumb... MEANIE!\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, Applejack, last rope! Make it count!\n\nRainbow Dash: Lemme go! I don't need you guys! Leave me alone! Wh-what happened? [gasp] How's Ponyville? Where are the Elements?! Did we stop Discord?\nAll: [cheering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe it's a little early for a group hug.\n\nDiscord: [laughter] Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing.\nTwilight Sparkle: Not as wonderful as friendship.\nDiscord: Oh, this again?\n[explosion]\nApplejack: That's right. You couldn't break apart our friendship for long.\nDiscord: Oh, Applejack. Don't lie to me. I'm the one who made you a liar. Will you ever learn? [gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: I'll tell you what we've learned, Discord: we've learned that friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt it's worth fighting for!\nDiscord: Ugh, gag. Fine, go ahead. Try and use your little Elements. Friend me. Just make it quick. I'm missing some excellent chaos here.\nTwilight Sparkle: All right, ladies, let's show him what friendship can do!\nPinkie Pie: Wait-wait-wait! [slurp] [growl]\nDiscord: Huh. What's this? No. Nooooo!\n[rocks cracking] [crash]\n\n[trumpet fanfare]\nPrincess Celestia: We are gathered here today to once again honor the heroism of these six friends who stood up to the villain Discord and saved Equestria from eternal chaos.\nCrowd: [cheering]\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nTwilight Sparkle: Quill.\nSpike: Check.\nTwilight Sparkle: Parchment.\nSpike: Check.\nTwilight Sparkle: Extra ink.\nSpike: Check.\nTwilight Sparkle: Extra extra ink.\nSpike: Check.\nTwilight Sparkle: Is that everything on the checklist?\nSpike: Yep.\nTwilight Sparkle: Great. Now that we've completed the checklist of things we need to create a checklist, we can make my checklist of the things I have to get done by the end of the day. Ready?\nSpike: Ready!\nTwilight Sparkle: Item one: create checklist of the things I have to accomplish by the end of the day.\nSpike: [sighs]\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: How are we doing, Spike?\nSpike: Let's see... We've already dropped off your cape at the cleaners, returned the blackboard you borrowed from Cheerilee, ordered new parchment and quills from the stationery shop...\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmm... Seems like we just placed an order for those a few days ago.\nSpike: Can't imagine why we go through so many of them.\nTwilight Sparkle: Sounds like we're ahead of schedule. What's next?\nSpike: Cupcakes!\n\nSpike: Whoa...\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, I only ordered twelve.\nMrs Cake: Oh, I know, dear, but I had an extra. So I thought I'd make it a baker's dozen.\nSpike: Uhhh-no!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, that was very thoughtful of you. It's just some of the icing from the extra cupcake is getting all over the one next to it. See?\nMrs Cake: Ohh... sure...\nTwilight Sparkle: It's just that I'm planning on sharing these at a picnic later and I don't want anypony to feel like somepony else is getting more icing.\nMrs Cake: Oh, no... of course not.\nTwilight Sparkle: Not to worry, I'll just move some of this one to... hmm... I think I may have scooped too much... oops! Now those two have more. Let's just try this again... Hmm, no, that won't do. Let me just... hmm... put some here, and... no, that's not right. A little more on this one, a little bit... and wait... I'll just... ooh, a little bit here, and here, and... perfect!\nMrs Cake: Hmm, oh yes... much better...\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, time to tackle the next item on our\u2014 oops! Looks like we're going to have to add 'give a baby dragon a bath' to our list.\nSpike: [slurp]\nTwilight Sparkle: Very efficient! And a little bit gross.\nSpike: Eh.\n\nSpike: Looks like that's everything!\nTwilight Sparkle: Almost everything.\nSpike: \"Triple-check checklist to make sure we didn't miss anything when we double checked the checklist.\" Uh... check. Ugh... I've been holding that quill so long, I've got a claw cramp! Well, good thing we don't have anything to report to Princess Celestia this week... I don't think I could write another word!\nTwilight Sparkle: We haven't sent a letter to Princess Celestia this week?!\nSpike: Why? Is that bad?\nTwilight Sparkle: Bad? BAD? Of course it's bad! I'm supposed to send Princess Celestia a letter every week, telling her about a lesson I've learned about friendship! Not every other week, not every ten days, every... single... week!\nSpike: Huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: Ohh... Where's my calendar, where's my calendar?!\nSpike: Where it.. always is?\nTwilight Sparkle: When did we send the last one?\nSpike: Last... Tuesday?\nTwilight Sparkle: And today is...\nSpike: Tuesday?\nTwilight Sparkle: Ah! Oh nononononononono! If I don't send her a letter by sundown, I'll be... tardy!\nSpike: What's that now?\nTwilight Sparkle: Tar-dy, Spike! Late, I'll be late! Oh, how could I let this happen? I'm usually so organized. I've never been late with an assignment.\nSpike: Oh, please! You're the most studious student ever! I'm sure the Princess will forgive you if you miss one little deadline.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm afraid to take that chance, Spike. This is the ruler of all of Equestria we're talking about. The pony who holds my fate in her hooves! What if she doesn't forgive me?\nSpike: Yeah... I don't think she\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: What if instead she starts thinking I'm not taking my studies on friendship seriously?\nSpike: Why would she\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: What if she makes me come back to Canterlot and puts me back in school and makes me prove I've been taking them seriously by giving me a test?! [gasps] What if I don't pass?!\nSpike: Well, why wouldn't you pass\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: She's my teacher. Do you know what teachers do to students who don't pass? They send them back a grade! But she won't just send me back a grade. She'll send me back to... magic kindergarten.\nVarious fillies: [laughing]\nSpike: Twilight? Twilight!\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh?\nSpike: That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! You're not going to be sent back to magic kindergarten.\nTwilight Sparkle: You're right. I have no reason to worry. Because I'm going to solve a friend's problem and get that letter to Princess Celestia before sundown!\nSpike: [sighs]\nTwilight Sparkle: So... got any problems, troubles, conundrums, or any other sort of issues, major or minor, that I as a good friend could help you solve?\nSpike: Huh. Hmm. Huunh. Huh... I got nothin'.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sigh] Then it looks like I'm going to have to find somepony who does.\nSpike: [sigh] This won't end well.\n\n[clock ticking]\nTwilight Sparkle: You've got this, Twilight. You still have plenty of time to get that letter to Princess Celestia! Has to be somepony who needs the help of a good friend!\nRarity: [screaming]\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity!\nRarity: [continued screaming]\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't worry, Rarity! I'm here!\nRarity: [sobbing] Why me-e-e-e-e-ee... [gasp] WHYYYY?! Why? Why-y?! And of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING!\nTwilight Sparkle: What's happened? Are you alright?\nRarity: [gasp] I've lost my diamond-encrusted purple ribbon! I have searched high, and I have searched low. Low and high! High and low! But I can't find it anywhere! Anywhe-e-e-e-ere! How can I possibly finish my latest creation if I can't find it?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Never fear, Rarity. As your friend I'll do my best to help you fi\u2014\nRarity: Oh, there it is. Isn't it always just the last place you look?\nTwilight Sparkle: So... you just lost your ribbon?\nRarity: Mm-hm!\nTwilight Sparkle: But now you've found it?\nRarity: Yuh-huh.\nTwilight Sparkle: And nothing else is bothering you? Nothing that I, as a good friend, could help you with?\nRarity: Hmm... there is one thing.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes?\nRarity: I think I left my measuring tape under the fabric over there. Could you get that for me?\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Measuring tape? Sure.\nRarity: Twilight? Is there something bother\u2014 Twilight?\n\n[clock ticking]\nTwilight Sparkle: No need to panic. Rarity is just one pony. I'm sure one of my other friends will need me.\nRainbow Dash: [grunting and kiai noises]\n[crashing]\nTwilight Sparkle: What in the world...? Rainbow must be angry with Applejack! She must hate her guts! How wonderful! Rainbow Dash! Stop! Listen, Rainbow. I know you're upset with Applejack, but don't worry. Whatever it is that has come between you two, I'm sure that I, as a good friend, can help you resolve your problems.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, what are you talking about?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to hide your feelings from me! I can tell you two must've had a terrible fight.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Now, why don't you tell me all about your issues with Applejack.\nRainbow Dash: I don't have any issues with Applejack.\nTwilight Sparkle: You don't? Then why are you destroying her property?\nRainbow Dash: Because she asked me to. Right, Applejack?\nApplejack: Yes, ma'am. I wanted to put up a new barn, but this one's gotta come down first. Hehe. Now get back to it, R.D.\nRainbow Dash: You got it, boss!\nApplejack: I'd take cover if I were you.\nTwilight Sparkle: [yelps]\nRainbow Dash: [screams]\n[explosion]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sigh]\n\n[clock ticking]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sigh] I can't believe I wasted all that time. I should have just come here first. Fluttershy always has some fear she's trying to get over. As a good friend, I'll be able to help her.\nBear: [roars]\nFluttershy: [grunting]\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy?\nFluttershy: [grunting, yelling]\nTwilight Sparkle: How can this be happening? Of all the days she had to stop being such a scaredy-pony, she had to pick today?! What am I going to do?!\nFluttershy: You really should have come to me sooner. You were carrying so much tension in that shoulder.\nBear: [growls]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: It's fine. It'll all be fine. The day isn't over yet. But it will be over soon!\n[clock ticking]\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans] It'll be all over! My time in Ponyville! My advanced studies! Nono. You're a good student. You can do this. Ooh! But what if I can't? You can! You just have to keep it together. Keep. It. Together!\nSpike: Are you talking to... yourself? Twilight?\nFillies: [laughing]\nSpike: Snap out of it!\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh?\nSpike: Are you okay?\nFillies: [laughing]\nSpike: Twilight, I'm really worried. I mean this letter thing is really getting to you. Here. You've been so anxious all day that you completely forgot about the picnic. Why don't you just relax and go hang out with\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: The picnic! I should go see my friends!\nSpike: I'm glad you've come to your senses.\n\nRarity: Please tell me I did not forget the plates. [gasp] I did. I totally forgot them. Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING! [cries] Why, why, why... Uh... What? You didn't expect me to lay on the grass, did you?\n[bray]\nApplejack: You alright, hun?\nTwilight Sparkle: No! I am not alright.\nApplejack, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity: [surprised muttering]\nTwilight Sparkle: It's just terrible.\nApplejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity: Yes?\nTwilight Sparkle: Simply awful.\nApplejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity: Yes?!\nTwilight Sparkle: It's the most horrific trouble I've ever been in and I really really really need your help!\nApplejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity: YES?!\nTwilight Sparkle: My letter to Princess Celestia is almost overdue, and I haven't learned anything about friendship!\nApplejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity: [sighs]\nFluttershy: Oh, thank goodness. I thought something really awful had happened.\nTwilight Sparkle: [strangled noises] Something awful has happened! If I don't turn in the letter on time, I'll be tardy! TARDY!\nApplejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity: [giggles]\nApplejack: No offense, sugarcube, but it looks like somepony's gettin' themselves all worked up over nothin'.\nTwilight Sparkle: This is not nothing. This is everything. I need you guys to help me find somepony with a problem I can fix before sundown! My whole life depends on it!\nPinkie Pie: [giggles] Oh, Twilight, you're such a crack-up! [laughs]\nApplejack: Come on now. Have a seat and stop sweatin' the small stuff.\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\nFluttershy: Wow. I've never seen Twilight so upset before.\nRarity: Oh, what a drama queen. Mm. Relatively speaking...\n\n[clock ticking]\nTwilight Sparkle: Clock is ticking, Twilight. Clock. Is. Ticking. Keep it together. If I can't find a friendship problem... I'll make a friendship problem!\n\n[bird chirping]\nTwilight Sparkle: [insane giggles]\nApple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle: [giggling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hi, girls! [twitching]\nApple Bloom: Oh, hi, Twilight. How's it go\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: Gr-eat. Just great. You three look like you're doing great too! Looks like three good friends who obviously don't need the help of another good friend. This is Smarty Pants. She was mine when I was your age, and now I want to give her to you!\nScootaloo: Uhh... she's... great.\nApple Bloom: Yeah. Great.\nSweetie Belle: I really... like her... mane.\nTwilight Sparkle: She even comes with her own notebook and quill, for when you want to pretend she's doing her homework!\nScootaloo: That's... um... great.\nApple Bloom: Yeah... great.\nSweetie Belle: I really like her... mane?\nTwilight Sparkle: I just hope the fact that there are three of you and only one of her doesn't become a problem! I'd hate to cause a rift between such good friends. So, who wants to play with her first?\nApple Bloom: Uh... You should play with her first, Sweetie Belle. Y'know, 'cause you like her mane so much.\nSweetie Belle: Nonononononono. I think Scootaloo should get to play with her first.\nScootaloo: I'd love to, but, um, you take her, Apple Bloom.\nApple Bloom: Applejack says it's important to share.\nTwilight Sparkle: [thinking] I gotta think of something! Thinkthinkthinkthinkthink Twilight, think! [gasp] That's it! [aloud] Ooh, you're going to like Smarty Pants. And you're going to like her more than anything.\nScootaloo: [gasp] I want it.\nApple Bloom: I need it.\nSweetie Belle: I really like her mane!\nApple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle: [arguing]\nTwilight Sparkle: The 'want it, need it' spell. Works every time. Okay, okay, let's break it up. I think we can all see that there is an important lesson to be learned here about\u2014 ugh! C'mon, girls, we're all friends here, right? Don't you think you ought to share?\nApple Bloom: No way!\nTwilight Sparkle: [groan] Big McIntosh! Thank goodness! You've gotta help me get that doll away from those girls!\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nApple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle: [continue arguing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, thank you so much. Now if you could just give her to me?\nBig McIntosh: Nnnope.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh no!\nApple Bloom: Give her back!\nApple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle: [Don't touch it! It's mine! I want it!]\nMayor Mare: What's all the commotion about?\nOrange Swirl: They're fighting over that doll!\nSweetie Drops: That incredible, amazing doll!\nPonies: [arguing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Can't... get... a clear shot! [grunting]\nMayor Mare: Gimme!\nBig McIntosh: Nope.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, what have I done?!\n\nPonies: [arguing]\nApplejack: Y'all hear that? What in the name of all things oats 'n apples is goin' on here?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't look at it!\nRarity: Don't look at what?\nTwilight Sparkle: My Smarty Pants doll! I enchanted her and now everypony is fighting over her!\nFluttershy: Why would you enchant your doll?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, I had to do something! I had nothing to report to Princess Celestia! I thought if I couldn't find a problem, I'd make a problem! The day is almost over!\nApplejack: Not almost!\nPrincess Celestia: Twilight Sparkle!\nApplejack: Whoa nelly.\n[Smarty Pants doll squeaks]\nBig McIntosh: [neighs and whinnies]\nPrincess Celestia: Meet me in the library.\nTwilight Sparkle: Goodbye, girls. If you care to visit, I'll be in magic kindergarten, back in Canterlot.\nFluttershy: Magic kindergarten?\nRainbow Dash: Canterlot?\nPinkie Pie: We're never gonna see Twilight again!\nApplejack: Uh, what are we gonna do, y'all?\nRarity: Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING! What? I really mean it this time!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: But...but... I'm supposed to send you a letter about friendship every week. I missed the deadline. I'm a bad student! I'm... tardy!\nPrincess Celestia: You are a wonderful student, Twilight. I don't have to get a letter every week to know that.\nTwilight Sparkle: Really?\nRainbow Dash: Wait!\nPinkie Pie: You can't punish her!\nApplejack: It wasn't her fault!\nPrincess Celestia: I'm listening.\nFluttershy: Please, your Highness. We all saw that Twilight was upset.\nRainbow Dash: But we thought that the thing she was worrying about wasn't worth worrying about.\nApplejack: So when she ran off all worked up, not a single one of us tried to stop her.\nRarity: As Twilight's good friends, we should have taken her feelings seriously and been there for her!\nFluttershy: Please don't take her away from us just because we were too insensitive to help her.\nPrincess Celestia: Looks like you all learned a pretty valuable lesson today.\nApplejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity: Mm-hmm.\nPrincess Celestia: Very well. I'll forget Twilight's \"punishment\" on one condition.\nApplejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity: [All right, etc.]\nPrincess Celestia: From this day forth, I would like you all to report to me your findings on the magic of friendship when, and only when, you happen to discover them.\nApplejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity: [cheering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Celestia, wait! How did you know I was in trouble?\nPrincess Celestia: Your friend Spike made me aware that you were letting your fears get the best of you. I commend him for taking your feelings seriously. Now, if you will all excuse me, I must return to Canterlot. I'm expecting some mail.\nApplejack: Y'all heard the Princess. Spike, take a letter.\n\nApplejack: [clears throat] Dear Princess Celestia,\nWe're writin' to you because today we all learned a little somethin' about friendship.\nFluttershy: We learned that you should take your friends' worries seriously.\nRainbow Dash: Even if you don't think that she has anything to worry about.\nRarity: And that you shouldn't let your worries turn a small problem...\nPinkie Pie: ...into an enormously huge entire-town-in-total-chaos Princess-has-to-come-and-save-the-day problem.\nApplejack: Signed, your loyal subjects.\nSpike: P.S. Obviously Spike did not have to learn a lesson, because he is the best, most awesome friend a pony could ask for. Unlike everypony else, he took things seriously, and- Eheh... uh... yeah... I'll just, um...\nTwilight Sparkle, Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity: [laughs]\nSpike: [snorts]\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nSpike: Ugh, come on, Twilight. We're gonna be late for the Nightmare Night festival. Huh? Are you that one kooky grandpa from Ponyville Retirement Village?\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm Star Swirl the Bearded! Father of the amniomorphic spell? Did you even read that book I gave you about obscure unicorn history?\nSpike: Uh.. [knocking] That sounds important. [yelp]\nFillies: Nightmare Night! What a fright! Give us something sweet to bite!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hi, everypony. Great costumes. Happy Nightmare Night, Granny Smith.\nGranny Smith: I should have been asleep five hours ago.\nPipsqueak: Pipsqueak the pirate, at your service. It's my very first Nightmare Night.\nTwilight Sparkle: Since you moved here from Trottingham?\nPipsqueak: No, my very first Nightmare Night ever!\nPinkie Pie: [chicken squawk] Enough chitchat! Time is candy!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, aren't you a little old for this?\nPinkie Pie: Too old for free candy? [chicken squawk] Never.\nTwilight Sparkle: [bell jingles] Do you like it?\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! Great costume, Twilight! You make a fantastic weirdo clown!\nTwilight Sparkle: A clown? Look at the borders on these robes. These are hoof-stitched!\nSpike: It's a great costume! Huh! Grandpa!\nTwilight Sparkle: [growls]\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Star Swirl the Bearded is only the most important conjurer of the pre-classical era.\nBackground ponies: Yeah! Whoo-hoo!\nTwilight Sparkle: He created more than two hundred spells! He even has a shelf in the Canterlot library of magic named after him. Maybe I should start up a pony group to teach ponies about history. I bet everypony would love it! Don't you, Spike?\nSpike: [chewing candy] Mm-hmm! [eating sounds] I love it!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey look, we're here already! Should we get something to eat?\nSpike: [burp]\nPinkie Pie: Twilight, Twilight! Look at our haul! Ah! Can you believe it? And then, we went to Cheerilee's house, and got a bunch more goodies.

[blows] Of Nightmare Moon, who makes you wary.\nAll: [gasps]\nZecora: Every year, we put on a disguise, to save ourselves from her searching eyes.\nFoals: [screaming]\nZecora: But Nightmare Moon wants just one thing: to gobble up ponies in one quick swing!\nPipsqueak and Pinkie Pie: [scream]\nZecora: Hungrily, she soars the sky. If she sees nopony, she passes by. So if she comes and all is clear, Equestria is safe another year!\nPipsqueak: Uh, Miss Zecora, if we wear costumes to hide from Nightmare Moon, so she won't gobble us up, how come we still need to give her some of our candy?\nZecora: A perfect question, my little friend. For Nightmare Moon you must not offend. [blows] Fill up her belly with a treat or two, so she won't return to come eat you!\nPinkie Pie: [screaming] Everypony! Just dump some candy and get out of here!\n[thunder]\n[wind whistling]\nAll: [screaming]\nPinkie Pie: [gasp] It's Nightmare Moon!

We have graced your tiny village with our presence, so that you might behold the real Princess of the Night! A creature of nightmares no longer, but instead a pony who desires your love and admiration! Together we shall change this dreadful celebration into a bright and glorious feast!\n[lightning, thunder]\nPinkie Pie: Did you hear that, everypony? Nightmare Moon says she's gonna feast on us all!\nAll: [screaming]\nPrincess Luna: [normal voice] What? No, children, no! You no longer have reason to fear us!

We won't even bother with the traditional royal farewell.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm gonna go talk to her.\nSpike: You can't talk to her! She's Nightmare Moon!\nTwilight Sparkle: No, she's not. I saw the Elements of Harmony change her back to good. But it seems like she's having some trouble adjusting after being gone for a thousand years.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Luna? Hi, my name is-\nPrincess Luna: Star Swirl the Bearded. Commendable costume! Thou even got the bells right.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you! Finally! Somepony who gets my costume! Uh, I just came to welcome you to our celebration! My actual name is-\nPrincess Luna: Twilight Sparkle. [booming voice] It was thou who unleashed the powers of harmony upon us and took away our dark powers!\nTwilight Sparkle: And that was a good thing, right?\nPrincess Luna: [normal voice] But of course. We could not be happier. Is that not clear?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, you kinda sound like you're yelling at me.\nPrincess Luna: But this is the traditional royal Canterlot voice! It is tradition to speak using the royal \"we\", and to use [booming voice] this much volume when addressing our subjects!\nTwilight Sparkle: You know, that might explain why your appearance was met with... mixed results. I think if you just changed your approach a bit, you might be met with a warmer reception.\nPrincess Luna: [booming voice] Change our approach?\nTwilight Sparkle: Lower the volume?\nPrincess Luna: [normal voice] Ohhh. We have been locked away for a thousand years. We are... not sure we can.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't worry, Princess. Fluttershy can give you some great pointers. She's delicate and demure with the sweetest little voice. [knocks]\nFluttershy: Go away! No candy here! Visitors not welcome on Nightmare Night!\nTwilight Sparkle: [nervous laughing] Fluttershy, it's me, Twilight!\nFluttershy: It is you. Ah, and Nightmare Moon. [gasp] Nightmare Moon? [yelps]\n[door slams]\nTwilight Sparkle: [nervous laughter] Wait right here.\n[various noises]\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy... you remember Princess Luna?\nPrincess Luna: [booming voice] Charmed.\nFluttershy: [timidly] Likewise.\nPrincess Luna: [booming voice] Twilight Sparkle hath spoken of the sweetness of thy voice. We ask thou teachest to us to speak as thou speakest.\nFluttershy: [very quiet] Okay.\nPrincess Luna: [booming voice] Shall our lessons begin?\nFluttershy: [whisper] Okay.\nPrincess Luna: [booming voice] Shall we mimic thy voice?\nFluttershy: [quiet] Okay.\nPrincess Luna: [booming voice] How is this?\nFluttershy: [hurriedly] Perfect, lesson over!\n[door thuds shut]\nTwilight Sparkle: A little quieter, princess.\nPrincess Luna: [booming voice] How is... [loud voice] this?\nTwilight Sparkle: Better. Right, Fluttershy?\nFluttershy: [nervous, dazed laughter] Yes.\nPrincess Luna: [loud voice] How... about... now?\nTwilight Sparkle: Now you're getting it.\nPrincess Luna: [normal voice] And... how about now?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes! Well done.\nPrincess Luna: [booming voice] I thank thee, dear Fluttershy! Our normal speaking voice shall surely win us the hearts of thy fellow villagers.\nPinkie Pie: Fluttershy! You've gotta hide us! Nightmare Moon is here and... [chicken squawk] Ah! She stole Fluttershy's voice so she can't scream when she gobbles her up!\nFoals: [screaming]\nPrincess Luna: [booming voice] Nay, children, wait! [normal voice] I mean... nay, children, no, wait.\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on, princess. Time for plan B.\n\nAll: Hurray!\nSeveral ponies: [whimper]\nSassaflash: Aah!\nPrincess Luna: It is of no use, Twilight Sparkle. They have never liked us and they never shall.\nTwilight Sparkle: My friend Applejack is one of the most likable ponies around. I'm sure she'll have some ideas.\nPipsqueak: Heee...!\nApplejack: Whoop. Careful there, partner. [whimper]\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh... Applejack, the princess is looking for a little advice on how to fit in around here.\nApplejack: \"Fit in\"? Really?\nTwilight Sparkle: [annoyed grunt]\nApplejack: I mean... that's easy! All you gotta do is have the right attitude. Loosen up a bit, be positive, play a few games, have some fun.\nPrincess Luna: Fun? What is this \"fun\" thou speakest of? Pray tell, what purpose do these serve?\nCherry Berry: Try to land the sp-sp-spiders on the web.\nApplejack: You can do it, princess!\nPrincess Luna: Ha! Your princess enjoys this \"fun\"! In what other ways may we experience it?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Fire away, princess!\nPrincess Luna: Ha ha! The fun has been doubled!\nAll: Hurray! [cheering]\nApplejack: Why don't you try bobbin' for apples? We got the best apples in Equestria here, princess.\nPrincess Luna: I ask that thou call us... me... Luna, fair Applejack. Hear me, villagers! All of you! Call me Luna!\nAll: Luna... [approving chatter]\nPrincess Luna: Show me to these bobbing apples.\nPipsqueak: Whoa! [splash]\nPinkie Pie: Hey, gals. Anypony seen Pip? We lost him the last time we had to run\u2013 [chicken squawk] Aaah! Nightmare Moon is gobbling Pipsqueak! Everypony run!\nFillies: [scream]\nPipsqueak: Help! My backside has been gobbled!\nPrincess Luna: 'Tis a lie! Thy backside is whole and ungobbled, thou ungrateful whelp! [hoof stomp, thunder] Fair villagers, please do not back away. Let us join together in... fun!\n[toy spider squeaks]\nPrincess Luna: Not enough fun for you? What say you to this?!\nCitizens: [screaming]\nPrincess Luna: Huzzah! How many points do I receive?\nGolden Harvest: [scream]\nCitizens: [screaming]\nPrincess Luna: Do not run away!\nDaisy: [scream]\nPrincess Luna: As your princess, we command you!\nCitizens: [screaming]\nPrincess Luna: [deafening voice] Be still!\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess, remember! Watch the screaming!\nPrincess Luna: [booming voice] No, Twilight Sparkle! We must use the traditional royal Canterlot voice for what we are about to say. Since you choose to fear your princess rather than love her, and dishonor her with this insulting celebration, we decree that Nightmare Night shall be canceled! Forever!\n[thunder]\n\nApplejack: [sigh] Shoot. We had everything goin' our way. Luna was happy, everypony in town was happy, now look at 'em.\nNoi: [crying] But I wanted to be a zombie next year.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's not over yet.\nApplejack: What are you gonna do?\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm going to do what I do best. Lecture her!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess?\nPrincess Luna: Leave me be, Twilight Sparkle.\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess, I'm sorry it hasn't worked out how we wanted. But you have to believe me when I tell you that Nightmare Night is one of the most popular celebrations we have.\nPrincess Luna: Yes. I can tell. By all the adoring shrieks of the children as they run away.\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess...\n\nPonies: [whimpering and crying]\nPinkie Pie: [chicken squawking] [shriek]\nTwilight Sparkle: No! No shrieking. No squealing or screaming either. Okay?\nPinkie Pie: [muffled] Okay.\nTwilight Sparkle: There's something I want you to see. And I promise that it's safe, but you really, really, really can't shriek. Do you promise not to shriek?\nPinkie Pie: Mm-hmm. [chicken squawk]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, you remember Princess Luna, right?\nPrincess Luna: Ah. The ringleader of the frightened children. Hast thou come to make peace?\n[thunder]\nPinkie Pie: Nightmare Moon! [chicken squawk]\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow!\nRainbow Dash: [laughter]\nTwilight Sparkle: She's changed, Pinkie! She's not evil or scary anymore! And she definitely doesn't want to gobble you up!\nPinkie Pie: Well, duh.\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh?\nPinkie Pie: I know that. Sheesh, Twilight. I'm almost as big as her, how's she gonna gobble me up?\nTwilight Sparkle: So why do you keep running away and screaming?\nPinkie Pie: Sometimes it's just really fun to be scared!\nTwilight Sparkle: Fun? Pinkie Pie, you're a genius!\nPinkie Pie: No, I'm not. I'm a chicken. [chicken squawk]\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Luna! I've finally figured out why you're having so much trouble being liked!\nPrincess Luna: [deadpan] Forgive me if I withhold my enthusiasm.\nTwilight Sparkle: Come with me. I'll explain everything on the way.\n\nPipsqueak: Gosh. I never thought my very first Nightmare Night would be my very last.\nZecora: Come, little Pip. Now don't you fret. Nightmare Night's not over yet. We still have candy left to give, so Nightmare Moon might let us live.\nMayor Mare: Yes. Come on, little ponies. What's Nightmare Night without the annual candy offering? You don't want Nightmare Moon to gobble you up, do you?\nSpike: Aw, the rainbow wig just kills it for me.\nApplejack: Come on, kids! Doesn't that sound like fun?\n\nPipsqueak: Goodbye, Nightmare Night. Forever.\n[wind whistling]\nNightmare Moon: [booming voice] Citizens of Ponyville! You were wise to bring this candy to me. I am pleased with your offering. So pleased that I may just eat it... instead of eating you!\nPonies: [scream]\nPrincess Luna: [spit] I am not certain that did what you meant for it to do, Twilight Sparkle.\nTwilight Sparkle: Just wait.\nPrincess Luna: For what? For... for them to scream some more?\nPipsqueak: Um... Princess Luna. I know there's not gonna be any more Nightmare Night, but do you suppose maybe you could come back next year and scare us again anyway?\nPrincess Luna: Child. Art thou saying that thou... likest me to scare you?\nPipsqueak: It's really fun! Scary, but fun!\nPrincess Luna: It... is?\nPipsqueak: Yeah! Nightmare Night is my favorite night of the year.\nPrincess Luna: Well then. We shall have to bring [booming voice] Nightmare Night back!\nPipsqueak: Whoa! You're my favorite princess ever! [to foals] She said yes, guys!\nFoals: YAY!\nTwilight Sparkle: See? They really do like you, princess.\nPrincess Luna: Can it be true? [thunder, booming voice] Oh, most wonderful of -- [normal voice] I mean... Oh, most wonderful of nights.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Dear Princess Celestia,\nWhen you first sent me to Ponyville, I didn't know anything about friendship. I met somepony tonight who was having the same problem -- your sister, Princess Luna! She taught me that one of the best things you can do with friendship is to give it to others, and help them find it themselves! And I'm happy to report that all of Ponyville has learned that even if somepony seems a little intimidating, even scary, when you offer them your friendship, you'll discover a whole new pony underneath. And even if my Star Swirl the Bearded costume didn't go over, this still turned out to be the best Nightmare Night ever!\n[lightning zap]\nRainbow Dash: [scream]\nPrincess Luna: [laughter]\nSpike and Twilight Sparkle: [laughter]\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[birds chirping]\nRarity: [mumbling in sleep] Oh...

I wouldn't be surprised if she's got a cutie mark in fancy cooking by the time we get back from our vacation.\nRarity: Vacation? Is that this week? As in 'starting this very instant' this week?! Uurh. Let me guess: apple sauce?\nSweetie Belle: Nope. Toast! We're gonna have the bestest time two sisters could ever have! I'm gonna go grab my stuff from Dad's wagon.\nRarity: So, now, when you say 'a week'... is that, um, seven whole days?\nCookie Crumbles: And six nights, I know! Such a short time to spend with your little sis.\nHondo Flanks: You gonna eat that?\nRarity: But I've got such a long to-do list. Oh well, I suppose 'spend time with your sister' will just have to be added to the list.\n[crash]\nSweetie Belle: Just a few necessities.\n\n[horn honks]\nRarity: Now, let's get that kitchen all cleaned up.\nSweetie Belle: Cleaned up? But we haven't even eaten yet.\nRarity: Well now, Sweetie Belle, I appreciate the gesture, but we simply can't eat this breakfast; it's burnt.\nSweetie Belle: It's not that burnt.\nRarity: Never fear, my dear, I'll get a proper breakfast going. [hums]\nSweetie Belle: Can I help?\nRarity: Oh, er, of course, er, in one moment, Sweetie Belle. Let me just get things started.\n\nSweetie Belle: Rarity! I thought you said I was gonna help!\nRarity: You are! You... can... put the garnish on the plates.\nSweetie Belle: You mean this parsley?\nRarity: Okay, now, easy! It has to be just right! No need to rush. No! That's too slow. Careful! Back up! Looking for perfection here...\nSweetie Belle: Whoa, whoa!\n[crash]\nRarity: Not... bad.\n\nRarity: [gasp] There are some things I must attend to. Can you take the dirty towels to the laundry room?\nSweetie Belle: No problem, I'll make myself useful!\n\nRarity: Sweetie Belle!\nSweetie Belle: I told you I'd make myself useful. Surprised?\nRarity: Am I? You washed my incredibly expensive one-of-a-kind designer crocheted wool sweater! Do you know how hard these things are to come by?\nSweetie Belle: What's the big deal?\nRarity: The big deal is that in the heat of the sun, wool... shrinks.\nSweetie Belle: Oh. Sorry.\nRarity: Nng... Well. Back to work. I must create!\n[splash]\nSweetie Belle: Sorry?\nRarity: Huh. Stay out of trouble, okay? Please?\nSweetie Belle: I just wanted to do something nice for my sister.\n\nSweetie Belle: Raargh, I'm so bored!

Did you use these gems?!\nSweetie Belle: Well, yes, but I know you have more in your work room\u2014\nRarity: But, but these are extremely rare baby blue sapphires! I need them for an outfit for an extremely important client!\nSweetie Belle: Oh. Sorry.\nRarity: [sigh] Sweetie Belle, what am I going to do with you?\nSweetie Belle: Oh! We could paint together, we could ride bikes, play chess, sing a song, catch frogs, pillow fight\u2014\nRarity: That's not what I meant!\nSweetie Belle: Oh.\nRarity: Now I have to go and find some more of these gems!\nSweetie Belle: I'll go with you and help!\nRarity: No! No thank you. You can help by picking up these papers and stacking them, neatly. Put the pens and pencils back exactly where you found them, and please find something to do that doesn't create a large mess for me to clean up!\nSweetie Belle: Geez Louise, can't I do anything right?\n\nRarity: Sweetie Belle! I'm back! Sweetie Belle? [gasps in shock]\nSweetie Belle: Surprise!\nRarity: My\u2014 ee\u2014 bleh\u2014 My inspiration room! What did you do? What did you do?!\nSweetie Belle: When I saw the big mess in your room, I thought I'd clean it up for you.\nRarity: This wasn't a mess! It was organized chaos! I was just about finished planning my new fashion line, and, and you, you, you went and, and you\u2014 and you put everything away!\nSweetie Belle: But every time I make a mess, you get upset!\nRarity: But this was my mess in my house!

Applejack an' I do it every year! You an' Rarity can compete against other sister teams in all these neat events!\nSweetie Belle: That sounds like the perfect way for us to hang out! Rarity will think it's an excellent idea.\n\nRarity: What a ridiculous idea. A contest at Sweet Apple Acres? It doesn't sound... very... clean.\nSweetie Belle: So, what, now you're back to hating messes?\nRarity: Sweetie Belle, watch your tone! I am still your big sister.\nSweetie Belle: Right! And any sister who cares about her sister goes!\nRarity: Sweetie Belle...! Honestly! Playing silly little games in the dirt is just... uncouth! With or without a sister.\nSweetie Belle: Well then! Maybe, maybe I'll try the Sisterhooves Social without a sister! In fact, I think I'll try the rest of my life without a sister!\nRarity: [gasp] Oh, I'm the one who's ruining your life?! Really?! Have you looked around this place? I'm the one who'd be better off with no sister!\nSweetie Belle: Well it looks like we finally agree on something! Neither of us needs a sister!\nRarity: Deal!\nSweetie Belle: Deal! Goodbye, un-sister!\nRarity: Hmph!\n\nApplejack: 'Uncouth'? She said the Sisterhooves Social was 'uncouth'?\nApple Bloom: Yeah! Uncouth? [belch] Wait. What's uncouth?\nSweetie Belle: It's not just the Social. She thinks I'm uncouth.\nApplejack: Honey, Rarity thinks everything's uncouth.\nApple Bloom: [with mouth full] What's uncouth?\nApplejack: It means uncivil. Y'know, bad mannered?\nApple Bloom: [belch]\nApplejack: Exactly. Sweetie Belle, just give Rarity some time. She'll come around. Sisters always do.\nSweetie Belle: Not sisters like Rarity.\nApplejack: Come on, now. Apple Bloom and I got some chores to finish up on. Maybe you can help!\nSweetie Belle: You sure you want me to help? I just mess everything up!\nApplejack: Oh, come on, that's just stinkin' thinkin'. Watch!\nApplejack and Apple Bloom: [laughing]\nApplejack: Good catch there, Apple Bloom! Whoo!\nApplejack and Apple Bloom: [more laughing]\nSweetie Belle: This is a chore?\nApplejack: Since we can't sell the bruised apples, we gotta collect them all for the pigs to eat.\nApple Bloom: It's a lot of work, so we make a game of it. Wanna try?\nSweetie Belle: Um, okay. Ow! You're right, it is hard work.\nApple Bloom: That's why we do it...\nApplejack and Apple Bloom: Together!\nSweetie Belle: Huh, Rarity never wants to do chores together.\n\nRarity: Ugh, all that work ruined, thanks to Sweetie Belle. Oh my. It's usually a big mess in here. [gasp] Id-ee-a! This is genius! I shall call it 'full spectrum fashions'! If Sweetie Belle hadn't\u2014 [clears throat] Well, no matter. She still shouldn't have touched my things without permission. Hm!\n\nApplejack: Apple Bloom! You're up!\nSweetie Belle: You're... making... grape juice? Rarity would call the fashion police on me if I got grape juice anywhere near her precious outfits.\nApple Bloom: Well, that's silly!\nApplejack: Apple Bloom...\nSweetie Belle: Please, Applejack, she didn't mean\u2014\nApple Bloom: Whoa! [laughing]\nApplejack: How d'you like them grapes, y'little whippersnapper!\nApple Bloom: That tickles! [laughing]\n\nRarity: Now to get these fabrics washed for my fabulous new line. Ooh, my favorite sweater... I just can't believe that Sweetie Belle.\nOpalescence: [yowls]\nRarity: Oh, Opal-wopal! It's as if Sweetie Belle knew the sweater was perfect for you. And Sweetie Belle should consider herself perfectly lucky that this thoughtless mishap turned out all right.

It's as if they were just one pony.\nApplejack and Apple Bloom: Yee-haw!\nApplejack: Way to corral some critters, sis!\nSheep: You coulda just a-a-a-asked.\nSweetie Belle: Rarity never high-hoofs me.\n\nRarity: Perfect! Just one more, and this ensemble is fini! Rrgh, Sweetie Belle! Where's her silly little arts and crafts project? Oh, Sweetie Belle! My one and only sister! What have I done? All the time I could have spent with you was wasted complaining and wishing you were gone! [crying dramatically] Woe is me! No! I must get her back! I must! As Celestia is my witness, I shall never be sisterless again!\n\nRarity: [gasp] Sweetie Belle! Oh, I have been galloping all over looking for you. I\u2014\nSweetie Belle: Oh hello, un-sister. What are you doing here? Better be careful, you might get some dust on you.\nRarity: Oh, Sweetie Belle, I want to apologize. I am not better off without a sister.\nSweetie Belle: I'm not better off without a sister either. Spending the day with Applejack and Apple Bloom made me realize that.\nRarity: Oh, Sweetie, you don't know how happy I am to hear\u2014\nSweetie Belle: And that's why I'm adopting Applejack as my big sister!\nRarity: What?!\nApplejack: What?!\nApple Bloom: What?!\nSweetie Belle: A sister is someone who loves and takes care of another sister. Applejack's a real sister.\nApplejack: H-Hold on, Sweetie Belle. Don't get ahead of yourself here.\nApple Bloom: Besides, she's my big sister!\nApplejack: Yeah, um\u2014\nSweetie Belle: [to Rarity] Or maybe she should be your sister, so she could teach you what a good sister is supposed to be!\nApplejack: Heh, um, actually, I\u2014\nRarity: But I don't need lessons on being a good sister, I-I promise! Listen! I'll show you how to cook my favorite quiche! Or, or, I'll show you the proper way to beautify your mane. Won't that be fun? Hm?\nSweetie Belle: Hm! You want me to go home with you, so we can do what you wanna do?\nRarity: Uh... yes?\nSweetie Belle: Just forget it!\nApple Bloom: We're still sisters, right?\nRarity: Well, that apology went swimmingly. Applejack, why do you have to be so good and make me look so bad?\nApplejack: [chuckles] Oh Rarity, once again you're thinkin' about yourself. Bein' sisters is a give and take. You've been doin' a whole lotta takin', but you haven't been doin' a whole lotta givin'.\nRarity: But of course I give. I give lessons. Reasonable demands.\nApplejack: But ya never give in. Bein' sisters is like... apple pie. You can have amazin' apples, and you can have a wonderfully crispy crust, but only together you can have a perfect apple pie.\nRarity: But apart, all we are is just a pile of mush and some crumbly dry mess... [gasp] I know what I need to do! I just hope it isn't too late!\n\nSweetie Belle: Well, I guess it's a good thing Rarity isn't here. Do I see 'uncouth' written all over this contest?\nApple Bloom: Look at the size of that pig!\nApplejack: He sure is a cutie.\nSweetie Belle: That's the last word Rarity would use. [mimicking Rarity] Oh my, what a repulsive monstrosity! This thing needs a head to toe makeover!\n[trumpet call]\nApplejack: It's almost time!\nSweetie Belle: Well, you two have fun.

Day. One. Day.\nGranny Smith: Is this thing on? [to Big McIntosh] I don't think this thing is on. [to the megaphone] Hello! [Big McIntosh whispers into her ear] What is the\u2014 e\u2014 oh.

Wait, where's Applejack?\nApplejack: [deep breath]\nSweetie Belle: I don't get it.\nApplejack: [chuckles] We switched places over at the very first mudhole.\nSweetie Belle: So, we did the whole competition... together?\nRarity: That we did, little sister. Well, except for the start line.\nApple Bloom: But you finished together!\nSweetie Belle: You mean... you were all in on it?\nApplejack, Apple Bloom and Rarity: Mm-hmm.\nSweetie Belle: You did this for me?\nRarity: Us. I did it for us. You see? We are apple pie!\nSweetie Belle: Huh?\nRarity: Uh, I'll explain later. For now, I think we deserve a celebration!\nApplejack, Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: Yeah!\nSweetie Belle: Where?\nRarity: The spa, of course.\nApplejack, Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: [laughing]\nSweetie Belle: Oh, Rarity.\nRarity: No, I-I-I'm serious.\n\nRarity: Very well then, what should we write to the Princess?\nSweetie Belle: I'll start. Having a sister is just about the bestest thing in the world. But it sure isn't the easiest.\nRarity: I agree that being sisters is a wonderful thing, but it takes teamwork. Sometimes it's about compromising. Sometimes it's about accepting each others' differences. But mostly, it's about having fun together. Even if it means getting your hooves a little bit dirty.\nSweetie Belle: A lot dirty.\nRarity: A little bit dirty.\nSweetie Belle: A lot dirty.\nRarity: A little bit dirty!\nSweetie Belle: A lo\u2014\nSpike: Hold it, hold it!

Good health, good hair... good heavens! Hmm... I bet you can mix up a brew to fix... anything.\nZecora: There are many mixtures in this room, but none for what you want, dear Apple Bloom. A magic potion does not hold the key. For a cutie mark, time is the only remedy.\nApple Bloom: Fine. Whatcha got goin' on there?\nZecora: I am brewing up another mix for a rooster and his chicks. [muffled] It seems the rooster has lost his crow, [normal] making mornings very slow.\nApple Bloom: Hey, I've seen that flower bloomin' in Ponyville! What is it?\nZecora: It is one we call 'Heart's Desire'. A dash will ignite the rooster's fire. With Heart's Desire, his talent comes into view, and he'll give a mighty cock-a-doodle-doo!\nApple Bloom: Zowie! Heart's Desire, huh?\nZecora: Ay me, but what is this? I have run out of amethyst. I must go get this purple flower for my brew to have full power!\nApple Bloom: Yeah, you go, you go.\n\n[foals chattering]\nSweetie Belle: I'm so hungry.\nScootaloo: Yeah, I can't wai--\nScootaloo and Sweetie Belle: Aah! Apple Bloom! You got your cutie mark!\n\nSweetie Belle: Um, Apple Bloom... what is it?\nScootaloo: Yeah! Is it an 'o'? Is your talent spelling?\nSweetie Belle: Or is it a ring? Are you a jewelry maker?\nTwist: Or is it a powdered donut? 'Cause that sounds delicious.\nApple Bloom: No, it's a loop-de-hoop!\nScootaloo: [gasp] A what now?\nApple Bloom: A loop-de-hoop! 'Least, that's what I always called it. Applejack made it for me from an old rain barrel when I was littler! Who woulda thought that loop-de-hoop would end up bein' my special talent?\nSweetie Belle: Wow, Apple Bloom, that's amazing!\nDiamond Tiara: That's it? That's your talent?\nSilver Spoon: Spinning a hoop around your waist? Puh-lease.\nApple Bloom: Oh, you ain't seen nothin' yet.\n[foals cheering]\nScootaloo: Apple Bloom, you're super-duper-loop-de-hooper!\nApple Bloom: Thanks, everypony!\n[bell rings]\nCheerilee: All right, my little ponies, time for class!\n[foals in awe of Apple Bloom]\nCheerilee: Apple Bloom?\nApple Bloom: Yes, Miss Cheerilee?\nCheerilee: I want you to take your loop-de-hoop into the yard... and give us all a lesson in your amazing loop-de-hooping!\n[foals cheering]\n\nDiamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: [grunting]\nApple Bloom: Don't worry, gals. Keep at it and you might get to be half as good as me!\nDiamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: Grr...\nApple Bloom: Great job, girls!\nSweetie Belle: You're too kind, Apple Bloom.\nScootaloo: Yeah, we stink.\nApple Bloom: Nah, you just need a little practice. Soon you'll be able to... hoop and bop! Hoop and hop! [muffled] Hoop and skip! [normal] And hoop and flip!\n[foals cheering]\nCheerilee: [laughs] Show us some more, Apple Bloom.\nApple Bloom: Well, all right, just a few more tricks. But be warned! These are advanced moves, not for beginners. Got that, Diamond Tiara?\nDiamond Tiara: [growls]\nApple Bloom: I call this one the hoop-la!\n[helicopter rotor noise]\nApple Bloom: Huh? Oof!\nDiamond Tiara: Another cutie mark? Hah! I guess that last trick was a lot of hoopla. Those cutie marks are fake!\nScootaloo, Sweetie Belle and Twist: [gasp]\nApple Bloom: What? No they're not!\nDiamond Tiara: Miss Cheerilee, have you ever heard of a pony with two cutie marks?\nCheerilee: I must say that I never have, but maybe Apple Bloom has two special talents!\nSilver Spoon: Oh yeah? Then let's see you do that!\nSnips: Spin plates!\nSnails: Yeah!\n[foals gasping]\nSweetie Belle: Two cutie marks?\nScootaloo: Two talents?\nApple Bloom: Aw yeah!\nSweetie Belle: Our friend is the most...\nScootaloo and Sweetie Belle: ...special pony ever!\nApple Bloom: Alright, everypony, You ready for a real show?\n\n[ponies cheering]\nRainbow Dash: [snoring]\nApplejack: [whistles]\n[more cheering]\n\nApplejack: Yee-haw, little sis! Congratulations on gettin' not just one, but two cutie marks! We're mighty proud of you, right, Big McIntosh?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nApplejack: I've never seen anythin' like it. Have you, Big Mac?\nBig McIntosh: Nnnope.\nGranny Smith: Why, the way you were a-hoopin' and a-hoppin' and kickin' and spinnin' reminded me of when I was a spry young filly. Guh, charley horse, charley horse! Ooh, that's better.\nApplejack: Why, Apple Bloom, I think you're ready to hit the rodeo circuit right now!\nApple Bloom: Actually, I'm ready to hit the hay right now. I'm plum tuckered. I'll see y'all in the mornin'. Night!\nApplejack: Night! Oh my, little Apple Bloom has finally blossomed, hasn't she, Big Mac?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\n\n[tapping]\nApplejack: [grunting] What in tarnation is that? Apple Bloom, what is all that awful... tapping? [gasp] Three cutie marks?!\nApple Bloom: Help me!\n\nApple Bloom: Help me!\nApplejack: C'mere, you! Ow! Ow! Whoa!\nApple Bloom: I'm sorry, Applejack! I dunno how to make it stop!\nApplejack: Well, I know somepony who might!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Three cutie marks. Three talents. I've never seen anything like it! I was just reading something about unusual equine illnesses. What was it?\nSpike: \"Perplexing Pony Plagues\", perhaps?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, Spike, you're amazing!\nSpike: Yes, well, I do have some talents.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hay fever... the trots... [gasp] Cutie pox!\nApple Bloom, Applejack and Spike: Cutie pox?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Cutie pox. This puzzling pony plague afflicted a population of ponies back in the Paleopony Period!\nSpike: Heh, say that ten times fast!\n[crash]\nTwilight Sparkle: Random cutie marks appeared all over the ponies' bodies, causing them to perform all the talents that came with them!\nApple Bloom: Just like me!\nApplejack: Yes, but what's the cure? What's the cure?!\nTwilight Sparkle: It says here there's no known cure!\nApple Bloom, Applejack and Spike: No known cure?!\nTwilight Sparkle: The cause of the breakout was never discovered, and the cutie pox disappears as mysteriously as they arrived!\nApple Bloom: Oh, no! Sacr\u00e9 bleu! Plus de marques de cutie! [gasp] Qu'est-ce c'est?! Je parle Fran\u00e7ais?!\nApplejack: My sister's speakin' in fancy!\nTwilight Sparkle: She needs help!\nApplejack: I know she needs help! We can't just wait for this to go away! We gotta find somepony to mix up a cure! And fast!\nApple Bloom: Tout de suite!\nTwilight Sparkle: Not some pony... some zebra!\nApplejack: Zecora!\n\nApplejack: Hurry, hurry!\nApple Bloom: D\u00e9p\u00eachez-vous!\n[jackhammer sounds]\n[accordion playing]\n[lions roaring]\nLily Valley: She's cursed!\nRose: Hexed!\nDaisy: Enchanted!\nSpike: No, she's not.\nDaisy, Lily Valley and Rose: [sigh of relief]\nSpike: She just has some weird mysterious disease with no known cure called cutie pox.\nPonies: Cutie pox?! [screaming and panicking]\nPony:  She's got the cutie pox!\n[hawk cry]\nZecora: I thought I had removed their fear the last time that I visited here. But doors are barred and shutters shut. Guess I should've stayed inside my hut.\nTwilight Sparkle: Zecora! Apple Bloom has cutie pox! We were just on our way to see if you had a cure!\nApplejack: But magically you're here! Was your zebra sense a-tinglin'?\nZecora: My 'zebra sense' did not bring me round, it was a special flower that I needed found. I thought I picked enough to fix all the potions I had to mix, but after my visit from Apple Bloom, some had mysteriously left my room. Apple Bloom! What do you say? Did this flower just walk away?\nApple Bloom: I, um...\nZecora: A cutie pox cure I have forsooth, for healing power is in the Seeds of Truth.\nApplejack: Well, well then give 'em to her! Quick!\nZecora: These seeds must be planted in the ground. With the truth, they'll grow, and the cure is found.\nApplejack: Come again?\nZecora: The Seeds of Truth do hold the cure, but one must speak words, true and pure.\nApple Bloom: [gulp]\nApplejack: Well then let's get to it! Alright, they're planted, now somepony tell the truth!\nApple Bloom: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\nApplejack: Somepony! Anypony!\nPinkie Pie: Yesterday I told Mrs. Cake that I ate two corn cakes, but I really ate three! Okay, six! I ate six corn cakes! [cries] Make it stop! Oh, make it stop!\nApple Bloom: Wah, I can't stand it any more! It's me! I admit it! I didn't earn my cutie mark! They're all fake! I figured the Heart's Desire would help me get what I wanted most! So when Zecora left her hut, I mixed up a special potion and put the rest of the Heart's Desire in it!\n[ponies awing]\nApple Bloom: [chomps, chews and swallows] Ahh.\nSweetie Belle: Apple Bloom!\nScootaloo: Are you okay?\nApple Bloom: I'm great, and I've never been happier to be a blank flank. But I'm awful sorry I lied, 'specially to you gals. I was so desperate for my cutie mark, I just got carried away. And I'm really sorry I snuck those flowers from you, Zecora. Why, I wouldn't blame you if you never wanted me to come by again.\nZecora: Now, Apple Bloom, do not be silly. You are always welcome, my little filly. With each mistake you learn something new, growing up into a better you.\nTwilight Sparkle: Apple Bloom, would you mind writing to Princess Celestia and telling her what you've learned?\nApple Bloom: I'd be happy to, Twilight! Spike?\nSpike: Ready!\n\nApple Bloom: Dear Princess Celestia,\nWaiting for what your heart desires can be really hard. So, you may try to take a shortcut. But this dishonesty never works, because you didn't earn what your heart desired. The only cure is being honest with yourself and others. And that's something every heart desires.\nApplejack: I sure am proud of you, sis. Seems like you finally learned the importance of patience.\nApple Bloom: Yup! All good things come to those who wait. Well! I've waited long enough.\nScootaloo: Actually, that was way too long.\nApplejack: What?!\nApple Bloom: So what are we gonna do today to earn our cutie marks?\nScootaloo: Well, I was thinking, for a pony who's never mixed up a potion before, you sure stirred up something fierce.\nSweetie Belle: Yeah! So what if your talent is potion making?\nApple Bloom: Oh my gosh, totally! Let's go talk to Zecora, now!\nSweetie Belle: Yeah!\nScootaloo: Woo-hoo!\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nRainbow Dash: Ha-ha! Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

She didn't know?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, we had initially planned on inviting Rainbow, of course, except\u2013\nPinkie Pie: We were totally gonna invite you, Rainbow, then Twilight remembered that you don't even have a pet, and Rarity remembered that you really like to take naps in the afternoon, so Applejack figured you wouldn't be missing out on anything anyway, and Fluttershy and I nodded our heads in agreement like this.\nFluttershy: Oh, please don't be mad at us.\nRainbow Dash: Oh, I'm not mad. You all are right. Not much point of a Pony Pet Playdate for me if I'm a pony without a pet, right?\nApplejack: Eeexactly. So, if'n you'll excuse us...\n[ponies chattering to their pets]\nRainbow Dash: Hey, now wait a minute! Just because I don't have a pet now doesn't mean I never want a pet!\nFluttershy: Ohh!

If any of you don't think you can handle it, bow out now before you humiliate yourself in front of your peers. This competition isn't for the weak. You'd better be prepared to step up your game! You call that flapping?! That's better. There's only room on Team Dash for one of you, and my future pet needs to be able to take it to the extreme! Any questions?\nApplejack: I got one. Does she understand what a pet really needs?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah, like care and attention, love and affection\u2013 Ugh! And breath mints!\nFluttershy: Now, you just pay attention, and try your best, and\u2013\nRainbow Dash: Seriously, Fluttershy! The turtle? What did you bring that thing here for?\nFluttershy: Technically he's a tortoise, and he's always dreamed of being somepony's pet. He just wants a chance to compete, he won't get in the way.

Look at him!\nFluttershy: It won't hurt to let him try.\nRainbow Dash: But\u2013\nFluttershy: Just let him try?\nRainbow Dash: Grrgh, ugh, fine! But don't say I didn't warn you! This isn't a game, you know! Alright, now these games will determine which one of you has the most important qualities I'm looking for in a pet. Speed. Agility. Guts. Style. Coolness. Awesomeness. And radicalness.\nTwilight Sparkle: Aren't those all the same thing?\nRainbow Dash: You would think that, Twilight. And that's why you would never qualify to be my pet.\n\nRainbow Dash: Speed!

That's pretty much all you can do, huh?\n\n[My Little Pony theme song plays on glasses]\n[bat screeches]\n[glasses shatter]\nRainbow Dash: Whoa! That was truly awesome! But I'm afraid this is the radicalness competition, so I'm gonna have to take some points off.\n\nRainbow Dash: [sigh] Listen, turtle...\nFluttershy: Tortoise.\nRainbow Dash: Whatever! You've had your fun, but I think you and I both know who made the cut and who didn't.\n[turtle croaks]\nRainbow Dash: You didn't.\n[ponies cheering]\nRainbow Dash: I mean... 'A' for effort and everything, you gave it your best shot, maybe I've got a gold star sticker around here somewhere you can have, but, seriously, go home. You're starting to creep me out. So, anyway, you're all outstanding competitors, but there can only be one of you who's number one. So the final tie-breaking contest is going to be... pause for dramatic effect... a race against... me! Through Ghastly Gorge! Dun dun dun!\n[eagle cries]\nRainbow Dash: Gesundheit.\n[Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\" plays]\nRainbow Dash: Actually, Ghastly Gorge isn't scary. It's fun. Heh. I've flown through it a million times myself, so obviously I'll be at the front of the pack. But whichever of you make it across the finish line with me will have proven you can keep up with me, and will have earned the honor and glory of getting to be my pet! Ready? Setgo! Woo-hoo! Haha! Try to keep up! Can't catch me, ha-ha!\n[wind whistling]\nRainbow Dash: [whistles] C'mon, slowpokes! You wanna win, don't ya? Oh! I forgot to tell you! Watch out for the Quarray eels!

Right, guys?\n[rock cracking]\n[rumbling]\nRainbow Dash: AVALANCHE! Hey! Whoaaaa! [grunts] C'mon... no! Wait! Come back! Don't leave me! I'm the one who's supposed to win! I don't wanna end up stuck here... forever! Oh no, nonono, th-this can't be happening. Forever is way too long to be trapped in Ghastly Gorge. I mean, it's like, forever! Somepony! Anypony! Help me!\n\nRainbow Dash: Wahoo! My prayers have been answered! Oh, thankyouthankyoutha\u2013 You?! Oh no! Now I'm not only going to be stuck here forever, I'm gonna be stuck here forever with the most annoying turtle in the world! Gyh, I'm doomed.

I owe you one.\nFluttershy: Rainbow! Your new pet is over here waiting for you!\n[ponies awing]\nRainbow Dash: Oh... right... yeah... that.\nSpike: What's the matter?\nPinkie Pie: You got your perfect pet, right?\nFluttershy: The best of the best like you wanted, remember? It can fly and it's not a squirrel! Should we sing about it again?\nApplejack: A falcon sure looks good on ya, Rainbow.\n[camera clicks]\n[tortoise yelps]\nRainbow Dash: Easy, fella. Nothing to be afraid of. The falcon sure does look cool... he's absolutely everything I wanted in a pet. [sigh]\nFluttershy: Yay?\nRainbow Dash: But I said whoever crosses the finish line with me gets to be my pet.\nPinkie Pie: You did! You did say that! She did say that, that was the rule!\nRainbow Dash: And the only racer who crossed the finish line with me was the one who stopped to save me when I needed help. The tortoise!\n[falcon cry]\nTwilight Sparkle: But what about the\u2013\nApplejack: Wouldja look at that? He even smiles slow.\nEverypony: [laughing]\nRainbow Dash: Spike, take a letter. Dear Princess Celestia,\nI used to think that the most important traits to look for in a pet, or any best friend, were all physical competitive abilities. But now I can see how short-sighted and shallow that was.\nOpalescence: [growls]\nRainbow Dash: Today I learned what the most important quality really is. A certain kind of spirit. A stick-to-it-ive-ness. A never give up, can-do attitude that's the mark of a real winner. And this tortoise has it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Tenacity.\nRainbow Dash: Gesundheit. You just can't stop that little guy. He's like a... like a... Tank!\nFluttershy: But Rainbow! You didn't want a pet that couldn't fly because it would keep you grounded and hold you back, remember?\nRainbow Dash: Hmm...\n\n[ponies chattering]\nRainbow Dash: Heh. C'mon, Tank!

Rainbow Dash deserves better! I motion that we declare her the most stupendous pony!\nScootaloo: 'Stupendous'? Is that the best you've got? I motion that we declare her... wonderiffic!\nSnips: Astonishing!\nScootaloo: Breathtaking!\nSnips: Astounding!\nScootaloo: Bedazzling!\nRainbow Dash: What about super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing?\n[ponies agreeing]\nScootaloo: All in favor of declaring Rainbow Dash the most 'super-ultra-extra-uh-whatever you said' pony in all of Ponyville, say 'aye'!\nFan club: Aye! [cheering]\nRainbow Dash: [giggles]\n\n[theme song]\n\nRainbow Dash: [sigh] What a beautiful day. There's nothing like a dip in the clouds to make a Pegasus feel super relaxed.\nAura: Help! Help! Help! Help!\nRainbow Dash: Looks like my sky swim will have to wait! I'm Rainbow Dash, and I'm here to rescue you!\n[ponies cheering]\nRainbow Dash: Wow. What's with this crowd? Uh, thanks, everypony. It was really no big deal.\nAura: To me it was! You're my hero, Rainbow Dash!\n[ponies cheering]\nScootaloo: That Rainbow Dash sure is something.\nSnips and Snails: Something special.\n\n\"Millie\": [screams]\nCream Puff: [crying]\n[ponies cheering]\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] Oh no! There's something wrong with the baby!\n[crowd gasps]\nRainbow Dash: She's not cheering for everypony's favorite hero, Rainbow Dash!\n[ponies cheering]\n[cameras clicking]\nScootaloo: There just aren't enough words in the dictionary to describe Rainbow Dash's awesomeness.\nTwilight Sparkle: I can think of a few new words.\nApplejack: And I bet 'modest' is not one of them.\n[ponies cheering]\nTwilight Sparkle: No, but she is kinda awesome.\n\n[elderly ponies chattering]\n[splintering wood]\nRainbow Dash: Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow Dash is here!\n[elderly ponies screaming]\n[ponies cheering]\nPony 1: We'd be lost without you!\nPony 2: You're our hero, Rainbow Dash!\nCrowd: Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!\nRainbow Dash: I can't hear you!\nCrowd: Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!\nTwilight Sparkle: Call me silly, but I think this whole hero thing might be going to Rainbow Dash's head.\nPinkie Pie: You may be right...silly.\n\nRainbow Dash: And then I zoomed into the well. I knew it would be dark and dangerous, but I didn't let that stop me. Danger's my middle name. Rainbow 'Danger' Dash. Thinking back on it, I acted pretty awesomely heroic that day.\nSpike: That day.\nApplejack: Awesomely heroic that day and awesomely arrogant ever since.\nPinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle: Mm-hm.\nRainbow Dash: Hey, Applejack. How'd you like to be immortalized as my friend?\nApplejack: Immorta-what?\n[camera clicking]\nTwilight Sparkle: Are you taking notes?\nSpike: Yup! I've been hoof-picked by Rainbow Dash herself, to write her autobiography!\nTwilight Sparkle: Umm, autobiographies are supposed to be written by the pony they are about.\nRainbow Dash: Maybe for your normal, run-of-the-mill ponies. But I'm far too busy saving lives to stop and write. That's why I hired Spike as my ghost writer.\nPinkie Pie: [yelps] Spike's a ghost!\nRainbow Dash: ...Anyway. Spike here writes down everything I say. Don't you, Spike?\nSpike: Don't... you... Spike. Got it!\nRainbow Dash: This way, I can stay focused on performing those acts of bravery that nopony else has the guts to perform. Yep, it takes guts. But it also takes brains. And sometimes a big lunch and a nap. Being a hero is surely not for everypony, but I'm up to the challenge.\n\nRainbow Dash: [grunts] There you go.\n\"Lemon Daze\": Someday, I wanna be just like you!\nRainbow Dash: Aim high, kid, but don't aim for the impossible.\nCherry Berry: [screams]\n[ponies gasp]\nCherry Berry: Help! Help!\nSnips: Uh, don't you think you should go and help?\nRainbow Dash: [muffled] Yeah, yeah. I've got a good ten seconds to spare. Just a couple more.\nSpike: The tension is unbearable. Will Rainbow Dash make it on time?\n[ponies cheering]\nPony: Holy turnips, that pony came outta nowhere!\nDaisy: I've never seen such bravery in all my life!\nMayor Mare: That's right! Ponyville has a new hero. A mysterious mare that has done well by our fair city today. I dub this new masked hero 'The Mysterious Mare Do Well'!\n[ponies cheering]\nRainbow Dash: Mare Do Well, huh? Well that mare would do well to stay outta my way! Ponyville's only got room for one hero, and that hero is me!\n\n[ponies screaming]\nRainbow Dash: [clears throat] Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow\u2013\nGlobe Trotter: Excuse me, uh, do you think you could skip your catchphrase and just hurry up and save us?!\nRainbow Dash: Ugh, fine! Picky, picky. Whoaaaa! Aah!\n[ponies cheering]\n\"Wisp\": [kissing] Oh, thank you, Mare Do We\u2014 e...\nRainbow Dash: I can't believe it. Mare Do Well is stronger than me? Well, a hero is more than just muscle, and she's gonna learn that the hard way.\n\n[jackhammer and drills]\nCrafty Crate: Huh?\nRainbow Dash: Huh? Never fear, your friendly neighbor\u2013 Whoa!\n[building creaking]\n[crashing]\nRainbow Dash: Never fear\u2013 Uh! I'm coming! Hold on! Whoa!\nJack Hammer: Look!\nCrafty Crate: [cheers]\n\"Jim Beam\": Look out for the\u2013 Watch out for falling\u2013 On your left! Agh! Your other left!\nRainbow Dash: Here ya go, safe and sound.\n[crash]\n\"Jim Beam\": [faints]\nRainbow Dash: Well, Mare Do Well, or should I call you Mare Do Slow? You're gonna have to pick up the pace if you wanna compete with me, 'cause I move like lightning.\n\"Rivet\": Actually, she saved all of us! We owe her our lives!\n[ponies cheering]\nRainbow Dash: [growls] Okay. She's strong, fast, and somehow knows what's gonna happen ahead of time. I've gotta step up my game.\n\n[water rushing]\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] If the dam breaks, the whole town will be flooded! Looks like Ponyville needs a hero! Easy peasy.\n[stone cracking]\nRainbow Dash: My game is officially back on. If only somepony were here to pat me on the back. Eh, guess I'll have to do it myself\u2013 [yelps] [screams] Help! [spits] Help! You?! I suppose you want me to thank\u2013 You gotta be kidding me...\n[ponies cheering]\nRainbow Dash: Lemme get this straight. She's strong, she's agile, and she's magic? Ughhh! How do I compete with that? Wait a minute. I do have a leg up on her. And that leg is... wings! Hah! Take that, Mare Do Well!\n[ponies cheering]\nRainbow Dash: Oh, for the love of Pete.\n\nApplejack: Gotta hand it to the girl, that Mare Do Well sure can pull off some pretty heroic feats.\nTwilight Sparkle: I must say, I was impressed by that spell she used to fix the dam. Seems like something like that would take quite a bit of study.\nRainbow Dash: [growls]\nFluttershy: She really cares about everypony's safety.\nRarity: Have you seen her costume? It is to die for! If you ask me she's a hero of fashion.\nApplejack: And she's modest and humble. She lets her actions speak for themselves. Gotta admire that.\nRainbow Dash: I don't have to admire that! I don't think she's all that great!\nSpike: She's... great.\nRainbow Dash: I didn't say that.\nTwilight Sparkle: Sounds like somepony's jealous.\nRainbow Dash: Who, me?\nSpike: Rainbow Dash is jealous.\nRainbow Dash: Don't write that, Spike!\n[others laughing]\nSpike: Correction: Rainbow Dash is very jealous.\nRainbow Dash: Fine! Laugh all you want, but I'll be the one laughing when I prove to you all that I'm just as good\u2013 no, that I'm a better hero than Mare Do Well!\n\nRainbow Dash: Huh, no sign of trouble here. Darn it. Buses and baby carriages are always careening down this hill. Where is an out-of-control vehicle when you need one?! Rrgh, there are absolutely no freak natural disasters going on anywhere! How am I supposed to prove myself when everything's so normal and safe? [gasps] Hold it right there, Granny Smith! You don't have to pretend with me. I can see that you're in way over your head here.\nGranny Smith: Eh, what's that?\nRainbow Dash: You're putting on a brave face, I get it. But you don't have to anymore. I'll help you cross the street!\nGranny Smith: [grunting] Actually, I can cross the street just fine!\nRainbow Dash: Don't worry! You're in extremely... capable... hooves!\nGranny Smith: [panicked grunts] Back off!\nRainbow Dash: [pants] Here we are! Safe and sound. A good and heroic citizen deserves a little recognition, don't you think?\nGranny Smith: I didn't wanna cross the street in the first place! [complaining and squeaking]\nAmethyst Star: [grunting]\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] Somepony's in trouble!\nAmethyst Star: [grunting]\nRainbow Dash: You'd better let me handle this, ma'am! For your own safety, I must ask you to stand back!\nAmethyst Star: Oh, brother.\nRainbow Dash: [cracks neck] [grunting] Ta-da!\nAmethyst Star: Uh... thanks.\nRainbow Dash: How would you describe what I just did? Would you say I was amazing?\nAmethyst Star: Aren't you milking this a bit?\nRainbow Dash: Please, just answer the question! Was I, or was I not, amazing?\nAmethyst Star: Oh, you're amazing alright. An amazingly\u2013\nRainbow Dash: Oh, look!\n[lawnmower rattling]\nRainbow Dash: Another great feat of heroism! I have just saved that grass!\n\"Pine Breeze\": From what?\nRainbow Dash: From weeds! Weeds that were attempting to eat this lawn!\nLiza Doolots: Lame...\nPony: Whatever.\nRainbow Dash: Aww, who am I kidding?\n\n[thundercloud rumbles throughout]\nRainbow Dash: All anypony talks about is Mare Do Well this and Mare Do Well that! What about me? How could everypony forget about me so easily? I mean... have I changed? Same sleek body. Same flowing mane. Same spectacular hooves. Nope, I'm still awesome. They're wrong. But... then... why am I all alone? I hate being all alone.\nScootaloo: Hey, Rainbow Dash!\nRainbow Dash: I knew it! No need to apologize, squirt. Anypony could make that mistake.\nScootaloo: Mistake? What mistake?\nRainbow Dash: Wait a minute. Why are you here?\nScootaloo: To invite you to join us! We're heading off to the thank you parade for Ponyville's greatest hero, Mare Do Well.\nRainbow Dash: No! No way! Can't you see I-I wanna be alone? I love being alone.\nScootaloo: Oh, okay. See you later then.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, right, like I'm gonna thank her. [mockingly] Thank you, Mare Do Well, whoever you are, for ruining e\u2013 [normal] Hey, squirt! Wait up!\n\nMayor Mare: Welcome to Ponyville's first, but surely not last, thank you parade, in honor of our city's greatest hero, the mysterious Mare Do Well!\n[ponies cheering]\nRainbow Dash: The mysterious Mare Do Well, huh?\n[ponies gasp]\nRainbow Dash: So what are you hiding? Let's see how mysterious you are without that mask!\nMare Do Well: [whistles]\nRainbow Dash: What the hay?\nMare Do Well: [whistles]\nRainbow Dash: Grrr... I got you now! Alright, Miss Mysterious! Mystery... solved! [yelps] P-p-p-p- Pinkie?! Whudda- hud-d-duh- hud-d-duh- huh?! Twilight?! Applejack?! There were three of you?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Yup, we all played Mare Do Well at different times.\nApplejack: I stopped the carriage bus with these babies, Bucky McGillicuddy and Kicks McGee.\nPinkie Pie: I saved the construction workers with my Pinkie Sense. [twitches]\n[flowerpot shatters]\nCherry Berry: Sorry!\nPinkie Pie: It's alright.\nTwilight Sparkle: And I used my magic to fix the dam.\nFluttershy: Ooh, ooh! And I did the flyby afterwards.\nRarity: I made the costumes. Fabulous if I do say so myself!\nRainbow Dash: I don't understand. Why? Don't you want me to be a hero?\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course we want you to be a hero.\nApplejack: But a real hero doesn't brag.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, I guess I did start to brag a little.\nOther main cast: A little?!\nRainbow Dash: Okay, a lot.\nTwilight Sparkle: Celebrating your accomplishments is natural. But...\nApplejack: ...Rubbin' them in everypony's face is not.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah, the only thing that should be rubbed in anypony's face is chocolate cake. [slurp]\nApplejack: I think we're getting off topic here.\nTwilight Sparkle: What we're trying to say is, it's great to be really good at something, but it's important to act with grace and humility.\nRainbow Dash: Ohhhh. That makes loads more sense. Yeah. You're right. And I guess I should've also acted with grace and humility when others outshine me. Like Mare Do Well.\nTwilight Sparkle: Sounds like you've got a letter to write to Princess Celestia.\nSpike: Already got it covered. As your ghost writer, I've already penned a letter to the Princess.\nRainbow Dash: That's nice of you, Spike, but I really wanna write this letter myself.\nSpike: Aww, come on, I wrote the whole thing already!\nRainbow Dash: Okay, let's hear it.\nSpike: [clears throat] Dear Princess Cel-\nRainbow Dash: Look out! It's a real ghost!\nPinkie Pie and Spike: [yelping and screaming]\nOthers: [laughing]\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nRarity: [gasp] Here? I get to stay here?\nPrincess Celestia: Twilight Sparkle said you were coming to Canterlot for a visit, and asked if I might accommodate you.\nOpalescence: [purring]\nRarity: Thank you so much, Princess.\nPrincess Celestia: You're very welcome.\nRarity: No, really. This is so nice of you.\nPrincess Celestia: It's nothing, really.\nRarity: Oh, but it isn't nothing, it's everything! I, I just don't know what to say but thank you, thank you! [kiss] Thank you! [kiss] Thank you! [kiss] Thank you, thank you, thank you! [more kisses]\nPrincess Celestia: You are very we\u2013\nRarity: Thank you!\nBags Valet: [pant] Your luggage, mademoiselle?\nPrincess Celestia: I'll leave you to get settled.\nBags Valet: Your highness.\nPrincess Celestia: Enjoy your stay.\nRarity: Thank you!\nBags Valet: [straining] Where would you like me to put these?\nRarity: That's perfect.\n\n[theme song]\n\nRarity: Opal, do you know what I love about Canterlot? [sip] Ahh. Everything! I may have been born in Ponyville, but I am a Canterlot pony at heart. [sip] Now, I know that we are here to pick up some fabrics for the shop, but Twilight was such a dear to get me that suite at the castle, I simply must make her something to express my gratitude. Hmm... ooh! An outfit for her birthday party this weekend! Perfect! Don't you just love it here, Opalescence? [sip]\nJet Set: Please excuse our interruption. I'm Jet Set, and this is my wife Upper Crust. We saw you from across the cafe and just had to find out...\nUpper Crust: ...Where did you get that simply marvelous chapeau?\nRarity: Oh, this old thing? Oh, it's just something I\u2013\nHayseed Turnip Truck: Rarity! Hey, Rarity! Whoo! It's me, Hayseed Turnip Truck! We met at the big hoedown in Ponyville last fall?\nRarity: Oh, yes, of course... how are you?\nHayseed Turnip Truck: Good! Real good!\n[crash]\nJet Set and Upper Crust: Hmm...\nJet Set: You're from... Ponyville?\nRarity: Well, yeah, yes, but\u2013\nHayseed Turnip Truck: She sure is! She's a real big-time fancy pants dressmaker there! Probably made that real purty thing she's got on her head!\nUpper Crust: I thought it looked a little country.\nJet Set: I told you it wasn't something you could get here in Canterlot, dear.\nJet Set and Upper Crust: Hmph!\nHayseed Turnip Truck: Well, they seemed real nice.\nRarity: [disappointed sigh]\n\nRarity: \"Looked a little country\". \"Not something you can get in Canterlot\". I'll show you something worthy of Canterlot!\n\nRarity: [panting] I have to get started right away. This new design is very ambitious, and I've already written to Twilight to let her know she'll have something beyond fabulous to wear to her party. [gasps] Fancy Pants!\nFancy Pants: I say, that's one way to make an introduction.\nRarity: Oh, goodness, I am so sorry. I didn't see you there. I've just got so many bags and I was trying to get back to my suite at the castle and\u2013\nFancy Pants: You're staying at the castle?\nRarity: Wh\u2013 The Princess invited me to stay in one of the suites.\nFancy Pants: You know the Princess?\nFleur de Lis: Hmm, a pony with expensive tastes, I see.\nRarity: Oh, it's for an ensemble I'm making for a friend. Her birthday is in a few days. [pants] Again, I am really sorry I bumped into you.\nFancy Pants: I'm not! Heheh, you are obviously somepony worth bumping into! Listen, I have a VIP box reserved at the Wonderbolts Derby this afternoon. Would you, would you be so kind as to join me and a few of my companions there?\nRarity: Me?\nFancy Pants: But of course, my dear.\nRarity: Well, I'm, uh, ah- no- sure.\nFancy Pants: We'd love to see you there, uh...?\nRarity: Rarity.\nFancy Pants: Rarity.\n\nRarity: Pro: Seeing the Derby from a VIP box is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Con: Going to the Derby cuts into the amount of time I have to finish Twilight's outfit. Pro: Fancy Pants is the most important pony in Canterlot. His stamp of approval could mean big things for me here. Con: Twilight's party might not be as sophisticated as the Derby, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't put all of my energy into creating her birthday ensemble. My Ponyville friends will appreciate my hard work more than anypony. I'd hate to let them down. And I won't. Opal, I am going to the Wonderbolts Derby as a guest of Fancy Pants! [excited giggling]\n\nRarity: Pardon me. 'Scuse me, 'scuse me!\nFancy Pants: Rarity, jolly good to see you! So glad you could make it.\n[ponies chattering]\nFancy Pants: Everypony, this is Rarity. She's staying at Canterlot Castle.\nPonies: [gasp, confused chattering]\nAnnouncer: Fillies and gentlecolts, welcome to the Wonderbolts Derby! The competitors are taking their places at the starting line, and the race will begin momentarily!\nFancy Pants: I'll be rooting for Rapidfire, of course. He's sure to take home the grand prize.\n[ponies agreeing]\nRarity: I don't think he has a chance against Fleetfoot.\n[ponies gasp]\n[fanfare]\n[whistle]\nAnnouncer: And it's Fleetfoot by a nose!\nRarity: [cheers]\nFancy Pants: Bravo, Rarity! I say, how did you know Fleetfoot would be victorious?\nRarity: My friend Rainbow Dash talks about her all the time. She says what Fleetfoot lacks in size, she makes up for in speed.\nSilver Frames: And who is this 'Rainbow Dash'?\nRarity: Uh... [gulps] Why... she's... she's the... the Wonderbolts' trainer, of course.\nFancy Pants: Staying at Canterlot Castle, and she knows the Pegasus training the Wonderbolts. I told you all this was an important pony.\n[ponies chattering]\nFancy Pants: Three cheers for Rarity, my new favorite party guest!\nPonies: Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray!\n\nRarity: ...And then I said, \"Puh-lease, that isn't a hat, darling, that's a natural disaster that somehow landed atop your head!\"\n[ponies laughing]\nSilver Frames: Oh, you are a delight, Rarity, an absolute delight. You simply must attend my art gallery opening this evening. [laughs]\nRarity: Oh, I'd love to, but I\u2013\nGolden Gavel: And let's not forget my charity auction tomorrow morning.\nRarity: Well, that sounds wonderful, but I\u2013\nSwan Song: And of course there's a seat for you at my dinner party tomorrow night.\nRarity: I'm flattered, really. It's just I have a project I really need to get started on, and-\nSilver Frames: Oh, but Rarity! I may as well close down the whole gallery if you can't attend!\nGolden Gavel: My auction is for charity, dear. For charity...\nSwan Song: And my dinner party will be a disaster if you don't come.\nRarity: ...of course I'll be there.\nSilver Frames: Wonderful!\nGolden Gavel: Oh, thank goodness!\nSwan Song: Disaster averted!\n\nRarity: Looks like we'll be spending a few more days here, Opalescence. Turns out bumping into Fancy Pants like that was the best thing that's ever happened to me. Of course, finishing Twilight's dress in time for her birthday party is still my top priority, but I can't possibly disappoint the Canterlot elite by rejecting their invitations now, can I?\n\n\n[Rarity]\nI'll be the toast of the town, the girl on the go\nI'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know\nI'll be the one to watch, the girl in the flow\nI'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know\n\nI'll be the toast of the town, the girl on the go\nI'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know\nI'll be the one to watch, the girl in the flow\nI'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know\n\nBecoming as popular as popular can be\nMaking my mark, making my mark in high society\nI'm the belle of the ball, the star of the show, yeah\nI'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know\n\nBecoming as popular as popular can be\nMaking my mark, making my mark in high society\nI'm the belle of the ball, the star of the show, yeah\nI'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know\n\nSee how they hang on every word that I speak\nMy approving glance is what they all seek\nI'm the creme de la creme, not just another Jane Doe\nI'm the type of pony every pony should know\n\nSee how they hang on every word that I speak\nMy approving glance is what they all seek\nI'm the creme de la creme, not just another Jane Doe\nI'm the type of pony every pony should know\n\nAt home, at the opera, on a fancy yacht\nBecoming the talk, the talk of all of Canterlot\nI'm the creme de la creme, not just another Jane Doe, yeah\nI'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know\n\nAt home, at the opera, on a fancy yacht\nBecoming the talk, the talk of all of Canterlot\nI'm the creme de la creme, not just another Jane Doe, yeah\nI'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know\n\nBecause I'm the type of pony\nYes, I'm the type of pony\nYes, I'm the type of pony every pony should know\n\nBecause I'm the type of pony\nYes, I'm the type of pony\nYes, I'm the type of pony every pony should know\n\nRarity: Oh, I hope I haven't forgotten anything.\nBags Valet: Me... too...\nRarity: We'd better get going.\nOpalescence: [yowls]\nRarity: I must get back to Ponyville with enough time to finish Twilight's ensemble.\n[letterbox clicks]\nRarity: For me? Dearest Rarity, your presence is requested at the Canterlot garden party tomorrow afternoon. Yours, Jet Set and Upper Crust! [gasps] The Canterlot garden party! Why, next to the Galloping Gala that is the premier event in Canterlot! [squeals] Oh, but if I go, I'll miss Twilight's birthday... But if I don't go, my new reputation in Canterlot as a Very Important Pony might be ruined! I might never be invited to another high society event again! Friend's birthday... Very Important Pony... [winces] It's just too important. [takes deep breath] My dear Twilight, I am afraid I won't be able to make it to your birthday party tomorrow, because... because poor Opal is quite ill, and she is in no condition to make the long journey back to Ponyville! I do hope you understand. Your friend, Rarity.\nBags Valet: I suppose this means you don't need me to bring down your bags?\nRarity: No. But, I will need some help unpacking them.\nBags Valet: Oomph!\nOpalescence: [yowls]\n\nRarity: What do you think? Too much? You're right. Too little. Ah, garden party, here I come!\nRest of main cast: Surprise!\nRarity: [gasps]\n\nPinkie Pie: [fades in] Swoosh!

She's so excited to see us, she can hardly talk.\nRarity: What I mean to say is, what are you all doing here?\nTwilight Sparkle: When I got your letter saying you were stuck in Canterlot, I asked Pinkie Pie if it wouldn't be too much trouble to move my birthday party here, so you wouldn't have to miss it!\nPinkie Pie: Balloons are super easy to pack.\n[balloons deflate]\nRarity: Wow... First you get me a suite at Canterlot Castle and now this. I don't know what to say, Twilight.\nRainbow Dash: How about you start by saying what you're doing in that fancy getup?\nRarity: This? Uh- well, I- I always put on something a little fancy when Opal's feeling under the weather... Cheers her right up. [laughs nervously]\nFluttershy: Oh, poor Opal. Where is the sick darling?\nRarity: Oh, uhh, she's... Hold on a minute.\n[doors slam]\nRest of main cast: Huh?\nOpalescence: [yowls]\nRarity: I am so sorry about this.\n[running water]\nOpalescence: [more yowling]\nRarity: She's resting on the bed.\nFluttershy: Poor baby.\nOpalescence: [more yowling]\nFluttershy: She looks awful.\nOpalescence: [growls]\nTwilight Sparkle: Is... that my dress?\nRarity: Yes.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's so... simple. So practical. So me! It's the perfect dress for my birthday party! I love it!\nRarity: [sighs in relief] You don't know how glad I am to hear you say that.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: When I told the Princess that I was moving the party to Canterlot, she was kind enough to offer us the Canterlot Castle ballroom!\nPinkie Pie: Isn't it fancy pants?\nRarity: Fancy Pants?! Where?! Ahh, I mean, where did you find the time to put up all these decorations? Ha-ha.

So happy to see you here.\nRarity: I wouldn't have missed this for the world.\nFancy Pants: [sniffs] I say, what is that scent you're wearing? It smells like... [sniffs] Is that cake frosting?\nRarity: ...Yes, I always dab a little frosting behind my ears before I go out. [laughs nervously] After all, who doesn't like the smell of cake frosting?\nFancy Pants: I know I do.\nUpper Crust: Mm-hmm.\nRarity: [sighs] Well, all this talk about cake has made me hungry. Think I'll go and see what's on the hors d'oeuvre table. If you'll excuse me...\nFancy Pants and Upper Crust: [starting conversation]\n\nFancy Pants and Upper Crust: [continuing conversation]\n\nRarity: [chokes]\n\nRarity: I think I left the bathwater running in my suite.\n\nRarity: I really should go check on Opal...\n\nRarity: Is that Princess Celestia?\n\nRarity: [hushed] I need to use the little fillies' room!\nTwilight Sparkle: [blows party trumpet]\n\nRarity: Can I get anypony more punch?\n\nRarity: I... have to go to do the... thing with the... stuff... you know...?

I- well I, you know, the truth is... the truth is...\nTwilight Sparkle: Were you at that other party in the garden?\nRarity: I, I...\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity, I'm surprised at you.\nRarity: Twilight let me explain! I\u2013\nTwilight Sparkle: I hadn't realized you were such a savvy businesspony!\nRarity: You must understand! I\u2013\nTwilight Sparkle: All of those ponies look so posh. And with the Grand Galloping Gala coming up, I bet you could totally get some of them to buy your dresses. Very smart!\nRarity: Woo, wwwhy yes, I-I didn't want you to think I was being rude, so that's exactly the reason I didn't tell you. The one and only reason.

Yes, you may. A very, very close friend of mine from Ponyville made it for me.\nRarity: [spits]\nFancy Pants: Ponyville? You don't say?\nTwilight Sparkle: I do say. Her name is\u2013\nRarity: Fancy Pants! Come with me! I'd like to show you this, er, thing that's over there. On the other side of the room.\nFancy Pants: In a moment, my dear.

Oh come now, who cares, it's just a plain old\u2013\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, don't be so modest! This dress you made is beautiful!\n[ponies gasp]\n[glass shattering]\nTwilight Sparkle: We all think so!\nFancy Pants: [to Rarity] You know these ponies?\n[ponies chattering]\nRarity: Yes. Yes, I do know them. They may not be as sophisticated as some of you Canterlot ponies, but they are my best friends. And they are without a doubt the most important ponies I know.\nJet Set: Important ponies? These ruffians?\nUpper Crust: Don't make me laugh!\nJet Set and Upper Crust: [laughing]\nFancy Pants: I, for one, find them charmingly rustic.\n[ponies gasp]\nFancy Pants: And I think the dress you made for your friend is lovely. [chuckle] I dare say every mare in Canterlot will be wanting one.\nUpper Crust: Oh, I'd like to place my order right now.\nJet Set: I think you should get two.\nFancy Pants: Er, yes, now then. How about you introduce me to your friends?\nRarity: With pleasure!\n\nRarity: Dear Princess Celestia,\nI wanted to tell you about the important lesson I learned during my visit.\nPrincess Celestia: Now that I would like to hear.\nRarity: I learned that no matter where you go in life, you should never forget that you are the product of your home and your friends. And that is something always to be proud of, no matter what.\nPrincess Celestia: Hm, a very valuable lesson to have learned.\nBags Valet: It certainly is!

Huh, that must be at least twenty carats! No inclusions, pristine facets...\nSpike: And totally delicious.\nTwilight Sparkle: Uhh... if you guys don't mind?\nRarity: Oh, uh, of course. I just came by to see if you had any books on historical fashion... [to Spike] Did you say... delicious?\nSpike: Sure did! Next week's my birthday, and this is my birthday dinner.\nTwilight Sparkle: Start with this one.\nRarity: Thanks, Twilight. I've got a feeling ruffled taffeta capes are going to make a huge comeback this season, and I want to be ahead of the game... [to Spike] I hope it's as tasty as it is beautiful, Spike. I've never seen anything quite so stunning before.\nSpike: Gosh... You really like it, huh?\nRarity: Like it? It's magnificent.\nSpike: [sighs] Then you should have it. This beautiful gem was meant to be with you.\nRarity: I don't know what to say... this is so thoughtful. Oh, my little Spikey-wikey!

You're out here demanding gifts now?\nSpike: Wow, you're right, Twilight. I don't know what got into me. Thanks for snapping me out of it.

I don't remember. Hey, can I have that globe? You're not using it, right?\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh?\n[crash]\nSpike: What about this book?\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, I'm worried about you. You're usually not so... grabby!\nSpike: My arms aren't usually [voice drops] this long either. What's happening to me?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [slaps]\nDr. Horse: Well now, what seems to be the problem?\nTwilight Sparkle: This is Spike. [slaps] And something's wrong with him.

Who's a brave widdle boy, huh? Who's a brave one?\n[rushing fire]\nTwilight Sparkle: So? What do you think, Doctor?\nDr. Horse: Well, I think I know what the problem is. He's a dragon!\nTwilight Sparkle: That's not the problem. He's always been a dragon.\nDr. Horse: Oh. Well, that would explain it. Listen, I don't know anything about dragons, I know about baby ponies. Maybe you should try a vet.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Okay. Thank you, doctor.\n\nDr. Fauna: Hm, well, I'm flummoxed. Y'bring me a dog, I've got it diagnosed in seconds. Snake even faster, but... to be honest, I've never seen a real live dragon before.\nSpike: [snorts]\nDr. Fauna: Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Sit.\nSpike: [pants]\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks anyway. C'mon, Spike.\n\n[squee, squeaks]\n[watch ticking]\n[slap]\nZecora: Ooh, he is starting to mature. Of this fact I am quite sure.\nTwilight Sparkle: Mature? So he's just... growing up? But that doesn't explain why he keeps grabbing things.\nZecora: A dragon's heart is prone to greed, a steady diet to make growth speed. Then, the resulting bigger size only makes their hunger rise. If this trait should go unchecked, if Spike continues to collect, more growth will certainly occur \u2013 he is going to turn into a monster.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] You mean the more things a dragon collects, the bigger and greedier he gets? But how do we stop him before he's completely out of control?\nZecora: If his monstrous ways you wish to impede, you must prevent him from practicing greed.\nTwilight Sparkle: [laughs nervously]\n\nApple Bloom: Get away from her, you brute!\nSpike: Spike want!\nScootaloo: You're not getting my scooter!\nSpike: Spike want!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey, Spike!

For that matter, who would steal my leaves?\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack, help! Spike's running wild and I need you to lasso him!\nApplejack: [laughs] Oh, that's a good one, Twilight.

Fluttershy?!\nFluttershy: I'm up here!\nTwilight Sparkle: What happened?\nFluttershy: I was helping my squirrel friends with a dance step, and all of a sudden, a giant, r-rampaging d-d-d-dragon stormed through!\nTwilight Sparkle: That was Spike!\nFluttershy: Spike? But why would Spike steal my chicken coop? He just pulled it out of the ground and filled it with a bunch of apples and stuff!\nPinkie Pie: [screams]\nRainbow Dash: That sounded like Pinkie Pie!\nTwilight Sparkle: C'mon, girls!\n\nPinkie Pie: Back!

You steal everypony's things, terrorize the town, and use me as a weapon against my own friends! Which, as horrible as it is, I can almost understand because you're a dragon and all. But this! [rips off dress] This is a crime against fashion! Oh no. You are not getting this gemstone! This was given to me by my dear friend Spikey-wikey, the kindest, sweetest, most generous dragon ever. And it is too precious to me to give to a greedy old beast like you!\nSpike: [grunts]\n\nSpike (flashback): Here, Rarity, you take it. It would mean even more to see you happy than to eat it myself.\nRarity (flashback): I... I don't know what to say. This is just so generous. [kisses]\n\nRarity: Oh, what now? I suppose you'll be eating me or something? Spike?! You're the rampaging dragon?!\nRarity and Spike: [screaming]\nPinkie Pie: Somepony do something!\nRainbow Dash: On it!\n[wind rushing]\nSpike: Rarity? I need to tell you something! Just in case we don't make it! I've always sort of had a crush\u2013\nFluttershy: [gasps] We did it! I can't believe we did it!\n[crash]\nRainbow Dash: All in a day's work.\nRarity: Spike, I just have to tell you how absolutely proud I am of you.\nSpike: Proud of me?\nRarity: Yes. It was you who stopped... w-well, you, from destroying Ponyville. You are my hero, Spikey-wikey! [kisses]\n\nSpike: Dear Princess Celestia,\nToday I learned a great lesson about friendship. Well, you might think that it would feel good to get lots and lots of stuff, but it doesn't feel nearly as good as giving something special to somepony you really care about. But I learned that it truly is better to give than to receive, and that kindness and generosity are what lead to true friendship. And that's more valuable than anything in the world. Well... almost anything.\n[kiss]\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[train whistle]\nTwilight Sparkle: We're getting closer!\nRainbow Dash: I can hardly wait!\nFluttershy: I'm so excited, I\u2014 I feel like shouting!

It was a strange and dark time. A time when ponies were torn apart... by hatred!\nAudience: [gasp]\nSpike: [normal voice] I know. Can you believe it? [accent] During this frightful age, each of the three tribes \u2013 the Pegasi, the unicorns, and the Earth ponies \u2013 cared not for what befell the other tribes, but only for their own welfare. In those troubled times, as now, the Pegasi were the stewards of the weather. But they demanded something in return: food that could only be grown by the Earth ponies.\nAudience: [whispering]\nSpike: The unicorns demanded the same, in return for magically bringing forth day and night. And so, mistrust between the tribes festered until, one fateful day, it came to a boil. And what prompted the ponies to clash? 'Twas a mysterious blizzard that overtook the land, and toppled the tribes' precarious peace.\n\nSpike: The normally industrious Earth ponies were unable to farm their land.\n[wind blowing]\nSpike: The Earth ponies were freezing. The home of the Pegasi fared no better. The Pegasi were hungry. And the unicorns were freezing and hungry. Even the unicorns' magic was powerless against the storm. Each tribe blamed the others for their suffering, and the angrier everypony grew, the worse the blizzard became. And so it was decided that a grand summit would be held to figure out a way to cope with the blizzard.\n[ponies chatting]\nSpike: Each tribe sent their leaders.\n[fanfare]\nSpike: Daughter of the unicorn king, Princess Platinum.\n[fanfare]\nSpike: Ruler of the Pegasi, Commander Hurricane. And lastly...\n[fanfare with kazoos]\nSpike: ...leader of the Earth ponies, Chancellor Puddinghead. Perhaps the three tribes could finally settle their differences, and agree on a way to get through this disaster.\nPinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity: [arguing]\nRainbow Dash: All I wanna know is why the Earth ponies are hogging all the food!\nPegasi: [shouting]\nPinkie Pie: Us?! We're not hogging all the food, you are! Oh, wait, you're right. It's us. Well, it's only 'cause you mean old Pegasusususes are making it snow like crazy!\nRainbow Dash: For the hundredth time, it's not us! We're not making it snow! It must be the unicorns! They're doing it with their freaky magic!\nRarity: [gasps] How dare you! Unlike you Pegasi ruffians, we unicorns would never stoop to such a thing! H-m-ph!\nUnicorns: Hmph!\nPinkie Pie: Well, if you non-Earths aren't gonna stop using your weirdo powers to freeze us all, then I'm just plum out of ideas.\nRainbow Dash: What a shocker. An Earth pony with no ideas.\nRarity: Commander Hurricane, please cease with the insults!\nRainbow Dash: You're not the boss of me, your royal snootiness!\nRarity: I beg your pardon?! I am a princess! I won't be spoken to that way!\nRainbow Dash: Well, I'm leaving first!\nPinkie Pie: No, I'm first!\nPinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity: [arguing]\nSpike: And the blizzard raged on.\n[windigos whinnying]\n\nSpike: So the summit of the tribes did not turn out as well as hoped, and the three leaders returned home to lick their wounds... and basically complain.\n\nRainbow Dash: Atten-tion! Well? Aren't you curious about how it went?\nFluttershy: Oh! Commander Hurricane, sir! How did it go, sir?\nRainbow Dash: Horribly! Those other tribe leaders are so disrespectful! Don't they realize that we are a mighty tribe of warriors, and should not be crossed? We have got to break ranks with those weak foals!\n[splat]\n\nRarity: [shivering] Clover the Clever! I need you!\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, your Majesty. Did the other pony tribes see reason as I predicted?\nRarity: Those other tribes are impossible! I, for one, can no longer bear to be anywhere near those lowly creatures. The unicorns are noble and majestic. We will no longer consort with the likes of them!\n[splash]\n\n[thud]\nApplejack: Wouldn't it have been easier to use the door, Chancellor?\nPinkie Pie: Maybe for you, Smart Cookie. But I am a chancellor. I was elected because I know how to think outside the box. Which means [slightly echoes] I can also think inside the chimney. Can you think inside a chimney?\nApplejack: Uh...\nPinkie Pie: I didn't think so.\nApplejack: Ugh.\nPinkie Pie: Ohmygosh. Hold on to your hooves! I am just about to be brilliant!\nApplejack: [under her breath] That'd be a first.\nPinkie Pie: I have decided that the Earth ponies are gonna go it alone!\nApplejack: Aw, so you mean the other tribes didn't come around? Shoot... I really thought we could get through to 'em if we\u2013\nPinkie Pie: Don't worry about them. We're the ones with all the food, right?\nApplejack: Actually, we're all out.\nPinkie Pie: Fine, then we'll have to go somewhere new where we can grow some new food. And with me as our fearless leader, what could go wrong?\n[crump]\nApplejack: [under her breath] Where should I start?\nPinkie Pie: The point is...\nPinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity: We must find a new land!\n\nRainbow Dash: C'mon, Private Pansy, let's get a move on! Hup-one, hup-two!\n[lightning cracks]\nFluttershy: [yelps]\nRainbow Dash: Get a hold of yourself, Private! We cannot let anything distract us from the mission at hand. To find, and if necessary, to conquer a new land!\nFluttershy: Conquer, sir?\nRainbow Dash: You never know where enemies might be lurking.\nFluttershy: I don't see any enemies, Commander. Just... snow.\nRainbow Dash: A-ha! What's that?! [fighting noises]\nFluttershy: [yelps]\nRainbow Dash: Okay. This is getting old.\n\nRarity: Oh, this is simply taking forever. My hooves are killing me! How long have we been walking for?\nTwilight Sparkle: About five minutes, your highness.\nRarity: Oh, I never imagined finding a new land would be so hard. But it'll all be worth it, don't you agree?\nTwilight Sparkle: I actually think that the three tribes could've tried harder.\nRarity: Stoooooop!\nTwilight Sparkle: What's wrong?\nRarity: That is what's wrong!\n[water rushing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Your Highness, it's just a stream. We can cross it easily.\nRarity: I refuse to get my gown wet. I have no intention of arriving at my new land looking like a bedraggled Earth pony, or worse yet a rough-and-tumble Pegasus. I, for one, have no intention of stooping down to their level. On the other hand, I have no trouble watching you stoop down.\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\n\nRarity: And do watch the gown, darling. It's worth more than all of the books in your library.\n\nPinkie Pie: Yes, yes. This is definitely the right direction.\nApplejack: It feels like we're going in circles.\nPinkie Pie: But that's impossible. Are you suggesting that I'm reading the map wrong?\nApplejack: Absolutely not, your chancellorness. It's just that there are holes in the map, and\u2013\nPinkie Pie: Of course! How else could I see where I was going?\nApplejack: Yeah, uh\u2013\nPinkie Pie: Or talk? I need to be able to talk! I mean, how would we survive if I just suddenly shut up?\nApplejack: Heaven forbid that should happen, your chancellorship. Heh. It's just that... the map is also upside down.\nPinkie Pie: I got a newsflash for you, Cookie. The Earth is round. There is no up or down.\nApplejack: You're right! It's such a relief to me that you're in charge of this map...\nPinkie Pie: Relief? You don't need relief! If anypony needs relief around here, it's me! I'm a chancellor! I'm a bigshot! You're just my, um... my, uh...\nApplejack: Secretary.\nPinkie Pie: Whatever. [spits] You take the map while I enjoy some relief.\nApplejack: Yes, Chancellor Puddinghead.\n\nSpike: [accent] And so, each leader encountered obstacles along the way, but eventually, they all arrived in a new and wondrous land. Nopony had ever seen paradise before.\n\nRainbow Dash: This is the new land we've been searching for!\nFluttershy: What a view... I can see my future house from here.\nRainbow Dash: I proclaim this new land to be... Pegasopolis!\n\nRarity: I've never seen such jewels! This ruby is dazzling. This whole land is dazzling. I'm double dazzled! [squeals] In the name of the unicorns, I hereby dub this land Unicornia!\n\nPinkie Pie: The air! The trees! The dirt! This dirt is the dirtiest dirt in the whole dirt world!\nApplejack: And fertile, too. Perfect for growing food.\nPinkie Pie: In the name of the Earth ponies, I think I'm gonna call this new place... uh... Dirtville!\nApplejack: How about \"Earth\"?\nPinkie Pie: Earth! Congratulations to me for thinking of it.\nPinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity: We found our new home!\nRainbow Dash: I planted my flag first!\nRarity: Did not!\nRainbow Dash: Did too!\nPinkie Pie: I planted mine earlier than first.\nRarity: All of you riffraff are trespassing in Unicornia!\nRainbow Dash: The name is Pegasopolis!\nPinkie Pie: Earth!\nRainbow Dash: Pegasopolis!\nRarity: Unicornia!\nRainbow Dash: I say we fight for the land.

Move on!\nSpike: [laughs nervously] [clears throat] [accent] Everypony was forced to seek shelter. They searched high and low, but the only shelter for miles was a cold and desolate cave. And, of course, the three tribes had to share it, and nopony was too happy about that.\n\nRarity: Please, Commander Hothead.\nRainbow Dash: It's Commander Hurricane.\nRarity: [clears throat] Please, Commander, could you just stand back and give me my royal space?\nRainbow Dash: You mean like this, your highness?\nRarity: Indeed not! You see this invisible line?\nRainbow Dash: Private, outline our territory for everypony to see. See this real, non-invisible line? No unicorns or Earth ponies are allowed to cross it! This is the sovereign territory of Pegasopolis!\nRarity: Clover the Clever?\nPinkie Pie: Uh... Smart Cookie!\nApplejack: I know, I know.\nRainbow Dash: What are you doing? Don't go around the rock, go over it! I'm not giving up an inch of territory to the enemy!\nRarity: That rock is clearly on the Unicornia side of the cave, and it belongs to us! [under her breath] Who knows? There could be jewels inside.\nRainbow Dash: [grunts] I claim this rock for Pegasopolis!\nRarity: Unhand that rock this instant, you scoundrel!\nPinkie Pie: Oh, look, you found my rock. I've been looking for it everywhere.\nRainbow Dash: Hey! You invaded our territory!\nPinkie Pie: Finders keepers, losers weepers!\nRainbow Dash: That's the last straw!\nRarity: Give me my rock!\nPinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity: [arguing]\n[wind blowing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Look, everypony! The entrance!\n[ice cracking]\nRainbow Dash: Great. Now there's no way out! We're trapped!\nRarity: You two deserve this horrible fate. You've done nothing but argue and fight with each other!\nRainbow Dash: You've been fighting too, your Highness.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! Worse! I haven't been fighting nearly as much as you!\n[ice cracking]\nRarity: How ridiculous! A unicorn never stoops to fighting!\nRainbow Dash: That's just 'cause you wimpy unicorns know you'd never win!

They're winter spirits that feed off fighting and hatred. The more hate the spirit feels, the colder things become!\nApplejack: Then... this is our fault. We three tribes... we brought this blizzard to our home by fightin' and not trustin' each other. Now it's destroyin' this land, too.\nTwilight Sparkle: And now our bodies will become as cold as our hearts... all because we were foolish enough to hate.\nFluttershy: Well, I don't hate you... I actually hate Commander Hurricane a lot more than I hate you guys.\nApplejack and Twilight Sparkle: [giggling]\n[windigo snorts]\nFluttershy: Actually, I don't really hate her, I just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really dislike her.\nApplejack and Twilight Sparkle: [laughing]\nApplejack: Well, I don't hate you guys either.\nTwilight Sparkle: Nor do I.\n[windigos whinnying]\nApplejack: No matter what our differences, we're all ponies.\n[ice cracking]\n[ice shatters]\n[windigos whinnying]\nFluttershy: What was that?\nApplejack: I didn't know unicorns could do that.\nTwilight Sparkle: I didn't either. Nothing like this has ever happened before. But I know it couldn't have been just me. It came from all three of us, joined together, in friendship.\nSpike: [accent] All through the night, the three ponies kept the fire of friendship alive by telling stories to one another and by singing songs, which of course became the winter carols that we all still sing today. Eventually, the warmth of the fire and singing and laughing reached the leaders, and their bodies began to thaw. [normal voice] And it even began to melt their hearts.\n[rumbling]\n\nSpike: [accent] The three leaders agreed to share the beautiful land, and live in harmony ever afterwards.

And Uncle Apple Strudel was on it.\nApple Strudel: Ooooooh, noogie-noogie-noggie! [laughs madly]\nDiamond Tiara: I can't wait to hear Granny Smith's presentation. [hushed] If she can remember any of it.\nDiamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: [giggling]\nGranny Smith: Long ago, when I was a little pony, things were very different here in Ponyville, 'cause there was no Ponyville!\n\nGranny Smith: [voiceover] That's right, my little ponies. Me and my family were pilgrim pony folk, back when I was a little filly. Oh, we ventured far and wide, collecting new seeds and sellin' the old. But my pa was the finest seed collector in all of Equestria. Then, one day, the Smith family found themselves in the most brilliant, most grand, most magnificent of all cities. A place called... Canterlot. Well, I bet your hooves to hindquarters I had never seen anything like it before nor since. And as if the beauty of that city wasn't enough, suddenly, she appeared. Princess Celestia, the most regal of all ponies. When lo and behold, she stopped to look at my pa's seed collection. Then Princess Celestia saw that we were plumb-tuckered and hankerin' to find our forever home. And bein' a royal Princess and all, she knew exactly the place for us to lay down our stakes. My pa gave the Princess a mighty thanks. We quickly found that land near the Everfree Forest, and we built our first home. Next, we planted our first orchards. But an orchard don't grow overnight, and we were getting mighty short on food. Now mind you, we were cautioned about the forest, and we knew that it was not fit to enter.\n[timberwolf howling]\nGranny Smith: [voiceover] But I knew there was critters livin' there. There must be somethin' to eat. It was dark and musty, and I won't lie, it was scary. But every inch was covered in plant life, and before I knew it, wasn't I standin' in front of the most incredible apple trees! I had never seen anything that bore this kind of colorful fruit! Oh I started picking apples quick as a whip!\n[timberwolves howling and growling]\nGranny Smith: [voiceover] I turned, and there before me stood the timberwolves! I've never run so fast in my life. I did the only thing I could think of.\n[pot banging]\nGranny Smith: [voiceover] My pa and I planted those special apple seeds, and before our eyes they grew like wildfire. Why, we had full grown trees faster than you could say 'lickety split'. Then each year, I paid close attention to the signs of the zap apples' special harvesting times\u2014how the weather affects the Everfree Forest, how the timberwolves howl when the zap apples first start growing, and how they zapped away if you didn't pick 'em all in one day! And the fruits of our labor were the best fruit we ever tasted. Soon enough I was mixing up batches of zap apple jam. Just like harvestin' the zap apples had its special rules, so did makin' zap apple jam. I learned that you gotta be extra friendly with the bees, otherwise their honey won't taste rightly sweet to mix in with the zap apples. Who'd'a thought that glass jars needed talkin' to? Or that zap apples like pink polka dots? But magic is as magic does. Just funny that way. Then ponies started comin' to our farm from far and wide just to get a taste of my zap apple jam. Some of them decided to stay, like Stinkin' Rich, Diamond Tiara's great grandfather. Matter of fact, the first thing he ever sold was my zap apple jam.\n[train whistle blowing]\nGranny Smith: [voiceover] And before we knew it, we had ourselves a nice little town, bustling with all kinds of ponies. And that is how Ponyville was founded.\nSilver Spoon: [clapping]\nFoals: [clapping]\nGranny Smith: Oh, thank you kindly, little ponies. Oh, now now, let's settle down.\nScootaloo: So if it weren't for you and the zap apples, Ponyville wouldn't even exist?!\nGranny Smith: Darn tootin', little filly!\nApple Bloom: If it weren't for my Granny Smith, your daddy wouldn't have Barnyard Bargains.\nRest of foals: [\"It's true\", general agreement]\nDiamond Tiara: But\u2013\nGranny Smith: [licks]\nDiamond Tiara: But she's just a... kooky old lady!\nFoals: [gasp]\nApple Bloom: She is not a kooky old lady! She is the most amazing pony in all of Ponyville!\n\nScootaloo: I think this is the best zap apple jam I've tasted yet!\nSweetie Belle: Must be 'cause you had something to do with it, Apple Bloom.\nGranny Smith: You betcha. Apple Bloom is one humdinger of a zap apple jammer!\nApple Bloom: I am?\nApplejack: So I take it Family Appreciation Day went well?\nApple Bloom: Did it? My Granny Smith is super special! I just forgot that for a little while.\nGranny Smith: Aw, don't fret. I forget things all the time. Now, I'll getcha... er... somethin'. Aw.\nApplejack: Who wants to help Granny sing to the water?\nFoals: We do, we do!\n\nGranny Smith and Foals: A, B, C, D, E, F, G...

Thank goodness they're home!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Hi! I finished up the work I had to do, so I thought I'd stop by and see if you needed any help. Whoa!\nPinkie Pie: Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming! I can't begin to tell you what my day has been like! I mean, these babies just won't listen to reason, and don't even get me started on their taste in stand-up comedy.\n[ba-dum tish]\nTwilight Sparkle: It's okay, Pinkie. I figured you would need some help. That's why I stopped by.\nPinkie Pie: Ex-cuse me?\nTwilight Sparkle: Babies take a lot of work, and some ponies are just not cut out to handle the responsibility.\nPinkie Pie: Is that so? Well, thanks for stopping by, Twilight. Sorry, I don't have time to visit. I'm very very busy with my responsibilities here.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm happy to help! It's no trouble\u2013\n[door slams]\nPinkie Pie: Well, of all the\u2013 She thinks I can't handle things on my own! Maybe because I haven't handled things on my own. Well, I can handle things on my own!\n\nPound Cake: [happy burbling]\n[toy squeaking]\nPumpkin Cake: [giggling and numing]\nPinkie Pie: Pound Cake. [growls] This is a crib. It is only to be used for napping, sleeping, and on occasion with permission, as a pretend old-timey Western fort. It is not a trampoline, so stop your jumping right now, mister!\nPumpkin Cake: [giggling]\nPinkie Pie: And you, young filly. We do not put anything in our mouth that we cannot safely and properly digest, so stop slobbering on that toy this instant!\n[toy squeaks]\nPinkie Pie: Now, we've all had a very exhausting afternoon, and it's time for all good little foals to take their nap. So, fall asleep!\nPound Cake and Pumpkin Cake: [snoring]\nPinkie Pie: [sighs] [kisses twice] Sleep tight.\n[toy squeaks]\nPinkie Pie: Now that's what I call handling things.

That is funny.\n\nPound Cake: [snoring]\nPumpkin Cake: [sleepy mumbling]\n\nPinkie Pie: Dear Princess Celestia,\nI've always had fun playing with little kids, and I thought babysitting meant just more playtime, right? Wrong! Being a caregiver is way more responsibility than just being a playmate. And today, I learned that sometimes our desire for responsibility can outrun our actual ability to handle it.\n\n[bell rings]\nMr. Cake: Pinkie Pie! We're back!\nMrs. Cake: How did everything go?

This is just... just...\nMr. Cake: Amazing is what it is. We had no idea how responsible you really are. Would you be interested in becoming our go-to babysitter on a permanent basis?\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] Hm- Ah- lemme check my schedule! I should be available a week from... never!\nPound Cake and Pumpkin Cake: [sighs]\nPound Cake: Pinkie...\nPumpkin Cake: Pie...\nPinkie Pie: [happily gasps] I have some free time next Tuesday.\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[galloping]\n[tap on wood]\nApple Bloom: Whoo-- Whoa!

And don't be nervous. Or if you are, use that nervous energy to do even better than you already would! And eat peanuts and popcorn and taffy. Taffy gives lots of nervous energy!

She loves Ponyville!\nGranny Smith: And she loves Sweet Apple Acres!\nApple Bloom: And she loves her family!\nRarity: [gasps] Something just dreadful must have happened to Applejack to make her not return!\nFluttershy: Maybe she's hurt, or sad, or scared!\nRainbow Dash: So, what are we waiting for?

Hurry it up in there!\n[toilet flushes]\nApplejack: Huh, some ponies. Sheesh.\nPinkie Pie: Applejack!

Are these some of your Ponyville friends?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, ma'am.\nRarity: And you are?\nCherry Jubilee: Why, I'm Cherry Jubilee, boss of Cherry Hill Ranch. Hasn't Applejack told ya? I saw her compete at the Equestria Rodeo. Never saw anypony win so many ribbons in all my life.\nApplejack: Aw shucks, Miss Jubilee. You don't have to go into all that.\nCherry Jubilee: Oh, she's so modest. Anyway, I can always use a pony with quick hooves and a strong back. So, when I heard Applejack was looking for a change of scenery, I snapped her up as quick as I could and brought her to Dodge Junction. Well, I'll let you catch up with your friends. See you back at the ranch.\nRainbow Dash: \"Change of scenery\"? What's that supposed to mean?\nApplejack: S'no big deal, guys. I thought cherries would be a nice change from apples, so I took the job and came here. That's it. End of story.\nPinkie Pie: That's it? Well, that's a terrible story!\nApplejack: Sorry, but that's all there is to tell. Thanks for checkin' on me, but y'all can go home now. Tell my family hi, and that I'm doing a-okay.\nRainbow Dash: Excuse me, AJ, but we didn't travel all over Equestria searching for you to come home without you!\nApplejack: Well, I didn't ask you to come lookin' for me! There is nothin' to tell and I am not going back to Ponyville!\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't care what she says. Applejack's not telling us something.\nRainbow Dash: Twilight's right. We gotta get her to spill the beans.\nPinkie Pie: What?! She had beans? Ugh, I told her I was snacky!\n\nCherry Jubilee: You ready to put your back into it, Applejack?\nApplejack: Sure am, Miss Jubilee.\nCherry Jubilee: Terr-ific. Come on in, girls!\nApplejack: What are you all doing here?\nTwilight Sparkle: We're your cherry sorters. Shall we get started?\nApplejack: Fine.\nCherry Jubilee: Haha, red cherries go in one bin, and yellow cherries go in the other. Simple as cherry pie. Uh, just one teensy thing to remember \u2013 have fun!\nApplejack: What are you five up to?\nRarity: Well, uh, you made working on a cherry orchard sound... so delightful.\nApplejack: Uh-huh. Well, just remember: no talking about Ponyville.\nRainbow Dash: Fine! Why don't you quit talking and get walking?\n[gears turning]\nTwilight Sparkle: So, AJ, how was Canterlot? Not talking about Ponyville, talking about Canterlot, totally different town.\nApplejack: Canterlot was fine.\nTwilight Sparkle: Was the rodeo fun?\nApplejack: Yes.\nTwilight Sparkle: Did you meet some nice ponies there?\nApplejack: Some.\nRainbow Dash: Really? Did you see Wild Bull Hickok? What about Calamity Mane?\nApplejack: Yes, I saw 'em both.\nRarity: And how did you meet Miss Jubilee?\nApplejack: Um, well, Miss Jubilee had a cherry stand at the rodeo. Real good treats.\nFluttershy: Um, excuse me?\nApplejack: Cherry winks, cherry cheesecake, cherry tarts. We struck up a conversation, being orchard folk and all.\nTwilight Sparkle: So you told her about Sweet Apple Acres?\nApplejack: Yes.\nRainbow Dash: Did you tell her why you weren't going back?\nApplejack: No, 'cuz it was none of her business!\nFluttershy: Ooh... Can you please slow down?\nRainbow Dash: Is it because I made it rain on you that one time?\nApplejack: No!\nFluttershy: Help!\nTwilight Sparkle: Is it because you were insulted when I gave you that book on organized orchards?\nApplejack: NO!\n[gears turning]\nRarity: Is it because you were insulted when I insulted your hair?\nApplejack: No, no, NO!

Need some help?\nApplejack: You promise not to ask me any questions?\nPinkie Pie: I promise.\n[thump]\nPinkie Pie: Have you ever had a cherrychanga? Ooh! Sorry, that was a question.\nApplejack: That kind of question is fine, Pinkie. No, I-I never had a cherrychanga.\nPinkie Pie: Well, no wonder, because I made it up myself! A cherrychanga is mashed up cherries in a tortilla that's deep fried. Cherrychanga. Great name, huh? Oh, but maybe I should call it a chimicherry. Ooh, that's good too. Which do you think sounds better? Cherrychanga or chimicherry? Or what if I combine them? Chimicherrychanga! What sounds the funniest? I like funny words! One of my favorite funny words is 'kumquat'! I didn't make that one up. I would work in a kumquat orchard just so I could say 'kumquat' all day! Kumquat, kumquat, kumquat! And 'pickle barrel'! Isn't that just the funnest thing to say? Pickle barrel, pickle barrel, pickle barrel! Say it with me! Pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, chimicherrychanga!\nApplejack: No! Make it stop, make it stop!\nPinkie Pie: [continues chant, muffled by Rainbow Dash]\nRainbow Dash: The only way to make it stop is for you to spill the beans!\nApplejack: Never!\nPinkie Pie: Speaking of beans, did you ever realize how many words rhyme with 'beans'? Lean, mean, spleen, unclean, bean... [continues under]\nApplejack: Alright, alright! I'll tell everypony what's goin' on! Just please stop talkin'! But... can it wait 'til tomorrow at breakfast? I'm plum tuckered out.\nRainbow Dash: Tomorrow, huh? I don't know...\nPinkie Pie: Do you Pinkie promise?\nApplejack: [sighs] I will tell you the whole truth at breakfast. Pinkie promise.\n\n[rooster crows]\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm glad we're finally gonna get some answers from Applejack.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, maybe.\nPinkie Pie: Don't worry, Rainbow.

Apologize!\nApplejack: Pinkie, I did not break my promise!\nPinkie Pie: Wha?\nApplejack: If y'all reckon back, I told you that I would tell you everything at breakfast. But I didn't come for breakfast. I couldn't come to that breakfast, not if it meant telling y'all what happened.\nPinkie Pie: Well, I... I...\nApplejack: I'm sorry, Pinkie, but I can't tell y'all the truth. I just can't!\nPinkie Pie: Well I heard a \"sorry\" in there, so that'll have to do for now. I'll get a real apology later. Rarity, catch me.\nRarity: What? Pinkie\u2013 [screams]\n[crunch]\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow, go back!\nRainbow Dash: No time! They knew what they were getting into!\nRarity: [coughs]\n\n[railway crossing bells]\nApplejack: Yes.

Oh, nuts.\nFluttershy: [panting]\nRainbow Dash: Not so fast!\n[thump]\nApplejack: Fine. Now you know.\nTwilight Sparkle: Know what?\nApplejack: Well, just look!\nTwilight Sparkle: I am. You won an amazing number of ribbons, just like Miss Jubilee said!\nApplejack: Don't you get it? There's every color of ribbon down there. Every color... but... blue. I came in fourth, third, even second, but I didn't win one first prize, and I certainly didn't win any prize money.\nRainbow Dash: But the telegram said you were gonna send money.\nApplejack: That's why I came here. I wanted to earn some money. After that big old send off Ponyville gave me, I just didn't have the nerve to come home empty-hooved. I couldn't come home a failure.\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack, you're not a failure.\nRainbow Dash: And we're your friends! We don't care if you came in fiftieth place! You're still number one in our books.\nApplejack: So... you're not upset or disappointed?\nFluttershy, Rainbow Dash and Twilight Sparkle: Nn-nn.\nApplejack: But what about the mayor? I don't think I can face her and tell her I didn't get that money to fix the broken roof.\nFluttershy: Applejack, we can always find a way to fix that hole in the roof. But if you don't come back, we'll never be able to fix the hole in our hearts.\nRainbow Dash: [sniffles] Darn it! Now you got me acting all sappy!\n\nApplejack: Dear Princess Celestia,\nIt's a tad easier to be proud when you come in first than it is when you finish further back. But there's no reason to hide when you don't do as well as you'd hoped. You can't run away from your problems. Better to run to your friends and family.\n\nPinkie Pie: What do you think, Rarity? Chimicherry or cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga?

She always ends up ahead of us in line, and then they always run out of cider!\nFluttershy: I guess I\u2013\nRainbow Dash: Well, not this year!

And just a tiny bit more lace.\nApple Bloom: A few more hoof-prints.\nScootaloo: Glitter!

I have lots of good friends and wonderful students who care about me very much. I'm gonna have an absolutely terrific Hearts and Hooves Day.

I've just come up with the best idea ever. We're gonna find Miss Cheerilee a very special somepony.\nApple Bloom: That is the best idea ever.\nSweetie Belle: [singsong voice] Tooold yooou!\nApple Bloom: So what are we waiting for?

He's really nice, super hard-working.\nApple Bloom: Hmm... but he's also pretty shy. He's never gonna ask Miss Cheerilee to be his very special somepony.\nSweetie Belle: Maybe he doesn't have to.\nApple Bloom: Huh?\nSweetie Belle: If we can get Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee in a really romantic setting, I bet she'll ask him.\nScootaloo: Sounds like a plan to me.\nApple Bloom: So? What are we waitin' for? Let's get out there and create the perfect date!\nApple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle: Yay!\n\nSweetie Belle: Flowers. Don't forget the flowers.\nApple Bloom: Oops.

We went and fixed up the gazebo all on our own. See?\nScootaloo: As long as you're here, why not have a bite to eat from this romantic-looking picnic? Oh gosh, seems like there's only room for two.\nApple Bloom: I guess we'll just be goin' then.\n[gramophone playing]\nScootaloo: You really think this'll work?\nSweetie Belle: Of course it will work.

Hello, Big Mac. Would you three like to tell us why it was so very important that we meet you here\u2014\nSweetie Belle: Punch!\nCheerilee: Excuse me?\nSweetie Belle: Punch! We made punch. We were gonna set up a stand and try to sell it but, heh, we needed somepony to taste-test it first.\nApple Bloom: Yup.\nSweetie Belle: We thought you two would be perfect together. To test it. Together. So, uh, we'll just leave you two alone. Together, to test it. [giggling]\nCheerilee: I'm very sorry about this. I mentioned to the girls that I don't have a very special somepony, and I believe they're putting us in these awkward situations because they've decided it should be you.\nCheerilee and Big McIntosh: [chuckling]\nCheerilee: I suppose we should just humor them for a moment. This punch does look delicious.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nSweetie Belle: I think they're gonna drink it.\nCheerilee: To good friends!\n[glasses clink]\nScootaloo: They're drinking it. They're drinking it!\nBig McIntosh and Cheerilee: [hiccup]\nScootaloo: They're looking into each other's eyes.\nApple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle: [giggling] They're about to be in for a big surprise!\nCheerilee: Big Mac?\nBig McIntosh: Yup?\nCheerilee: Will you be my very special somepony?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nSweetie Belle: YES!\nApple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle: [singsong voice] He's her special somepony! She's his special somepony!\nCheerilee: He's my special somepony.\nBig McIntosh: Eeeeeyup.\nApple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle: Aww!\nCheerilee: He's my shmoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony pie.\nBig McIntosh: You're my shmoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony pie.\nApple Bloom: Did he just say\u2014\nCheerilee: You're my cutie-patootie lovie-dovie honey-bunny.\nBig McIntosh: You're my heartie-smartie smoochie-woochie baby-waby.\nApple Bloom: Big Mac! Hey! Hello! What's going on?\nSweetie Belle: Miss Cheerilee, are you alright?\nCheerilee: I have a special somepony. A kissy-wissy snuggy-wuggy sugar bear.\nSweetie Belle: I think we may have given them too big of a nudge.\nBig McIntosh: You're my cuddly-wuddly boopsie-woopsie pumpkin pie.\nSweetie Belle and Scootaloo: Eugh!!\nScootaloo: Ya think?\n\nApple Bloom: What have we done?! My brother's actin' like a grade-A goofball!\nSweetie Belle: Maybe we added too much rainbow.\nScootaloo: Or maybe not enough cloud.\nSweetie Belle: Or maybe... uh-oh.\nApple Bloom: Whaddaya mean, \"uh-oh?!\"\nSweetie Belle: We might not have given Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee a love potion. We may have given them a love poison.\nApple Bloom and Scootaloo: What?!\nSweetie Belle: Apparently, some prince a long time ago whipped up this recipe and gave it to this princess he liked. He meant it to be a love potion, but things didn't turn out so well.\nApple Bloom: How \"not so well\" did things turn out?\nSweetie Belle: Well, there's something here about a dragon, the kingdom falling, chaos reigning... Okay, apparently it was all because the prince and princess were so lost in each other's eyes that they couldn't perform their royal duties.\nApple Bloom: Great! We've not only turned Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee into a couple of nonsense-spoutin' nincompoops, we may have put all of Ponyville in jeopardy!\nScootaloo: Come on, Apple Bloom. Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac don't have any royal duties.\nApple Bloom: But they still got responsibilities. If we don't fix this... Oh no, Miss Cheerilee won't be able to teach. Big Mac won't be able to harvest any apples, and before you know it... Ponyville will be overrun with uneducated little ponies starvin' for apples. Oh, it'll be chaos! It'll be chaos!\nSweetie Belle: There's an antidote!\nApple Bloom: Well, why didn't you say so? Didn't you see me gettin' all panicked back there?\nSweetie Belle: If we can keep Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac from looking into each other's eyes for one full hour, the love curse will be broken.\nScootaloo: Only an hour? Pfh, we can pull that off in a second.\n\nCheerilee: You take the first sip, snuggle-wuggles.\nBig McIntosh: No, you take it, schnoodle-dumplin'.\nCheerilee: No, you, shnooky-lumps.\nBig McIntosh: No, you, pookie-pie.\nMrs. Cake: I'm all for romance, but this has been going on for hours. What's happened to these two?\nSweetie Belle: [nervous chuckle] Who knows?\nMrs. Cake: Well, these lovebirds will probably be planning a wedding soon. I can always use the catering business.\nSweetie Belle: A wedding! That's it! Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac should get married!\nApple Bloom: How is gettin' hitched gonna keep them apart?\nSweetie Belle: They aren't really gonna get married. They're just gonna get ready to get married.\nCheerilee: [chuckle] No, you, biscuit-wiscuit bear!\nBig McIntosh: Nope, you, huggy-wuggy snuggy bunny!\nSweetie Belle: Hi, Miss Cheerilee, how are you?\nCheerilee: I have a very special somepony.\n[clank]\nBig McIntosh: I have a very special somepony.\nApple Bloom: Yeah, we noticed.\n[squeaking]\nSweetie Belle: Gosh, you two are so in love, the next thing you know, you'll be getting married.\n[smack]\nCheerilee and Big McIntosh: Married?!\nSweetie Belle: That's right. Maaarriiied.\nCheerilee and Big McIntosh: Married...\nApple Bloom: [gagging] Ugh!\n[squeaking]\nApple Bloom: 'Course, if you're gonna get married, you wanna pick out a really nice diamond for your\u2014ugh!\u2014shmoopy-doopy, uh, pookie-pie.\nBig McIntosh: Diamond!\nCheerilee: Shmoopy!\nScootaloo: Don't you think you should start looking for your wedding dress? You'll wanna look your best for your... [straining] honey-bunny snuggle-baby.\n[spring]\nCheerilee: Oh! Dress!\n[crash]\nSweetie Belle: Now we just need to keep them apart. I'll keep Miss Cheerilee occupied. You two do the same with Big Mac.\nApple Bloom: No problem.\n[clock ticking]\n[clock-tower bell chimes]\nSweetie Belle: Meet you back at the clubhouse in an hour when this whole mess is over.\n\nSweetie Belle: This one looks nice. Better try it on though.\n[furniture clattering]\n[clock-tower bell chimes]\nSweetie Belle: Ten minutes down, fifty minutes to go.\n\n[flapping]\nApple Bloom: No.\n[flapping]\nApple Bloom: No.\n[flapping]\nApple Bloom: Not that one either.\n[flapping]\nApple Bloom: No.\n[flapping]\nApple Bloom: Too... shiny. No. You know, somethin' less... shiny.\n\"Karat\": Mmm.\nApple Bloom: Miss Cheerilee deserves the best. [to Scootaloo] How much time is left? I'm runnin' out of ways to make diamonds sound bad.\nScootaloo: We still have twenty five minutes.\nApple Bloom: [sigh] [anxious] Where's my brother?\n\"Karat\": He made his purchase and departed out the back. Said something about needing to see his... shmoopy-shmoo.\nScootaloo: Ugh.\nApple Bloom: [gagging]\n\n[clock-tower bell chimes]\nApple Bloom: Okay, I'll see what I can do to slow him down. You go on to Carousel Boutique and warn Sweetie Belle.\n[wheels creaking]\nApple Bloom: Huh\u2014\n[clock-tower bell chimes]\nApple Bloom: [gasp]\n\nScootaloo: [gasping]\nSweetie Belle: What's wrong? Where's Apple Bloom? Where's Big Mac?\nScootaloo: On [gasp] his [grunt] way. Gotta [grunt] keep him [gasp] out of boutique.\n\nApple Bloom: Huh?\n[creaking]\n[clock-tower bell chimes]\nScootaloo: Move away!\nApple Bloom: He'll get to her! He's too strong!\nSweetie Belle: Let him go!\nBig McIntosh: Shmoopy-doo\u2014 Whoa!\nScootaloo: [sigh] I sure am glad you found those shovels.\n[clock-tower bell chimes]\nApple Bloom: One more minute and the spell will be broken!\nBig McIntosh: Shmoopy-doo!\nCheerilee: Sweetums?!\n[crash]\n[clock-tower bell chimes]\n[crash]\nBig McIntosh: Shmoopy-doo!\n[clock-tower bell chimes]\n[clock ticking]\n[crash]\nApple Bloom: Aaaa\u2014\n[smack]\n[clock-tower bell chimes]\nApple Bloom: Oh, please be normal, please be normal.\nCheerilee: Am I wearing a wedding veil?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nCheerilee: Are you sitting on a feather bed in a hole in the ground?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nCheerilee: Girls! Can you explain why I look like I'm getting married at the bottom of a pit?\nSweetie Belle: We may have given you the teeny-tiniest bit of love potion... that may have turned out to actually be a love poison, and you may have gone just a teeny-tiniest bit nutty.\nApple Bloom: But we only did it because we thought you and Big Mac would be really happy if you could be each others very special someponies on Hearts and Hooves Day.\nScootaloo: Our hearts and hooves were in the right place.\nCheerilee: We appreciate that you care about us and want us to be happy but\u2014\nApple Bloom: But no matter how good our intentions might have been, we shoulda never meddled in your relationship.\nScootaloo: Nopony can force two ponies to be together.\nSweetie Belle: It's up to everypony to choose that very special somepony for themselves.\nApple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle: We're sorry.\nCheerilee: And you can think about how sorry you are while you're doing all of Big Mac's chores at Sweet Apple Acres. Does that seem like a fair punishment to you?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\n\nApple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle: [sigh]\nApple Bloom: Hey there, Miss Cheerilee! What are you doin' here?\nCheerilee: Since you three are doing all of his chores, Big Mac and I thought we'd have a picnic at the gazebo.

He just... doesn't want to be bothered.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, he doesn't want to be bothered by your over-the-top super-hyper antics.\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow!\nPinkie Pie: No, no, it's okay, Twilight. I get what you're saying. What you're both saying. And I guess... I can leave Cranky alone. ...Right after he accepts my apology!\n\nPinkie Pie: Cranky!\nCranky Doodle Donkey: No! No!

I put two and two and two together and it added up to Matilda.\nCranky Doodle Donkey: What?\nPinkie Pie: Well, when you were talking about your souvenirs, you said something about trying to find a special friend! And y'know, I wasn't just born yesterday. Nuh-uh! My birthday isn't for another seventy five days!\nCranky Doodle Donkey: Huh?\nPinkie Pie: And then, in your scrapbook, there was a flower, an old ticket, and a menu from the Grand Galloping Gala! And I knew I recognized all these things.\nCranky Doodle Donkey: But how could you have ever seen them before?\nMatilda: Because I also have them in my scrapbook.\nPinkie Pie: And I'd seen them in Matilda's book!\nCranky Doodle Donkey: Oh, Matilda. The night we met at the Gala was the most magical night of my life.\n\n[old timey music begins]\nCranky Doodle Donkey: [voiceover] I couldn't wait to see you again. But when I came to your room the next day, you were gone.\nMatilda: [voiceover] Didn't you get my note?\nCranky Doodle Donkey: [voiceover] No, I never got it. Ever since that day I've gone from town to town to town, searching all over Equestria for you...\n\nCranky Doodle Donkey: ...Until finally I gave up. I came to Ponyville to retire from my search.\nMatilda: I was living in Ponyville the whole time. I always hoped that some day you would come and find me... Doodle.\nPinkie Pie: Uh. Matilda? Nopony calls him Doodle.\nCranky Doodle Donkey: Nopony... but Matilda. Mmm.\nMatilda: Oh, Doodle, I'm so happy to see you. [kisses]\nCranky Doodle Donkey: [braying]\nPinkie Pie: So does this mean that you accept my apology?\nCranky Doodle Donkey: Yes, Pinkie, I accept your apology, and I am honored to call you my friend.\nPinkie Pie: [firework explosion] Woo-hoo! This is just fantastic! Ooh, now we can hang out together and chat and sing songs and [gasps] party! Oh, I have to throw you guys a big party! It'll be called the 'Welcome to Ponyville/I Found My Lost Love/I'm BFF's with Pinkie Pie' Party! ...Or maybe something less over-the-top and not so super-hyper.\nCranky Doodle Donkey: Pinkie, we're eternally grateful to you. But... Matilda and I just want to spend some time together in peace and quiet.\nPinkie Pie: Oh. Um, but we're still friends?\nCranky Doodle Donkey: Pinkie, you went way, way, way out of your way to make me happy. Of course we're friends.\nPinkie Pie: Great!\n\nPinkie Pie: Dear Princess Celestia,\nThere are many different kinds of friends, and many ways to express friendship.

Would you mind moving your carts so I can pass?\nCherry Berry: Yeah yeah, in a minute, I just wanna finish up this story. And so the donkey says to the mule\u2013\nFluttershy: A-hemmmm, can you move? You're blocking my path.\nCherry Berry: Yeah yeah, in a minute! So the donkey says to the mule... [fades under] (Why don't we build a boat to get off this island? [laughs])\nFluttershy: \"When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!\"\nCherry Berry: ...and the mule says\u2013\n[splat]\nCherry Berry: Ugh! Easy does it, lady. We're moving, okay?\nFluttershy: Good!\n\nPinkie Pie: Who's next please? And what can I get for you today?\nFluttershy: What do you think you're doing?! Didn't you see me?\nShoeshine: Uh, I guess maybe.\nFluttershy: 'Maybe'? \"Maybes are for babies!\" [growling] Now go to the back of the line where you belong!\n[ponies gasp]\n[VCR rewind sound]\nPinkie Pie: Heyyy, look at you!\nRarity: Oh, your attitude is so feisty, it's fabulous.\nPinkie Pie: Looks like that monster's workshop really paid off!\nFluttershy: Iron Will's not a monster. He's a minotaur, and a true inspiration. His techniques really work.\nRarity: Well, they've certainly made a difference in the way you carry yourself. You truly are a whole new Fluttershy.\nFluttershy: Yes I am. And new Fluttershy feels pretty stoked about new Fluttershy.\nPinkie Pie: Well, old Pinkie Pie feels really proud of new Fluttershy. Proud as pink punch. Want some? [giggles]\nFluttershy: \"You laugh at me, I wrath at you!\"\n[crash]\nFluttershy: Bye, girls. What a day. Taxi! Oh no you don't. \"Cut in line, I'll take what's mine!\"\n[fight sounds]\nRoyal Riff: Aieeeeee! Ow...\nFluttershy: Nopony pushes new Fluttershy around! Nopony!\nPinkie Pie: Old Pinkie Pie is not so sure new Fluttershy is such a good idea after all.\nRarity: Old Rarity agrees.\n\nFluttershy: You got this, new Fluttershy! This day is yours! And nopony's gonna take it away from you! Am I right?! Right! What?! He's delivered the wrong mail, again!\n\"Mr. Zippy\": Oh\u2013\nFluttershy: And new Fluttershy does not want the wrong mail delivered to her cottage.\n\"Mr. Zippy\": Ohh, did I mix 'em up again? Sorry about that.\nFluttershy: \"You apologize, I penalize!\"\n[crash]\n\"Mr. Zippy\": Oh!\n[stamp]\nFluttershy: [bites]\nGlobe Trotter: Excuse me, do you know how to get to the Ponyville tower?\nFluttershy: [muffled] Sure, you just\u2013 [gasps]\nGlobe Trotter: Oh, that's a shame.\nFluttershy: [growls] \"You make me lose, I blow my fuse!\"\nGlobe Trotter: Hey!\n[bell ringing]\nRarity: Fluttershy! What are you doing?! That's no way to behave!\nFluttershy: Didn't you see what he did to new Fluttershy? And he thought new Fluttershy was a pushover!\nRarity: No, sweetie, he didn't. We saw the whole thing. We think that you've taken your assertiveness training a little too far.\nFluttershy: What?! You just want new Fluttershy to be a doormat like old Fluttershy! But old Fluttershy is gone!\nPinkie Pie: New Fluttershy? Old Fluttershy!?\nRarity: What happened to nice Fluttershy? We want that Fluttershy back.\nFluttershy: No, you want wimp Fluttershy. You want pushover Fluttershy. You want do-anything-to-her-and-she-won't-complain Fluttershy!\nPinkie Pie: Nyaaaaah! Too many Fluttershys to keep track of! Make it stop!\nFluttershy: Things getting too complicated for your simple little brain, Pinkie Pie?\nRarity: Now, stop right there! Let's not let things descend into petty insults!\nFluttershy: Why not? I thought 'petty' was what you're all about, Rarity. With your 'petty' concerns about fashion.\nRarity: [gasps]\nPinkie Pie: Hey, leave her alone! Fashion is her passion!\nFluttershy: Oh, and what are you passionate about? Birthday cake? Party hats? I can't believe that the two most frivolous ponies in Ponyville are trying to tell new Fluttershy how to live her life when they are throwing their own lives away on pointless pursuits that nopony else gives a flying feather about!\nPinkie Pie: [starts crying] Looks like nasty Fluttershy is here to stay!\nRarity: [starts crying] I cannot believe what that monster Iron Will has done to you!\nPinkie Pie and Rarity: [crying]\nFluttershy: Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur! [growls] [whimper] I'm the monster.\n\n[wind blows]\n[wolf howls]\nRarity: [knocks, clears throat] Fluttershy, are you in there?\nPinkie Pie: It's Pinkie Pie and Rarity!\nFluttershy: [muffled] Go away! Go away before nasty Fluttershy strikes again!\nRarity: Oh, sweetie, we all said things that we regret.\nPinkie Pie: We did?\nRarity: Shh.\nFluttershy: [muffled] Pinkie's right. I'm the only one to blame. [normal] But don't worry, I'm never coming out of my house again. Everypony will be a lot safer with me and my mean mouth locked away.\nRarity: [muffled] Sweetie, [normal] Pinkie Pie doesn't blame you, nor do I. You just received some bad advice from that Iron Will character.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! He's the one that made you act super-duper nasty. What I mean is, there are other ways to assert yourself besides yelling at everypony.\nRarity: Yes! [muffled] You can stand up for yourself without being unpleasant about it.\nFluttershy: I-I'm not sure I can. I'm too far gone. Whenever I try to assert myself, I become a monster.\n[lightning strikes]\nRarity: Oh, sweetie, you're not a monster.\nPinkie Pie: No, but he is.\nIron Will: Iron Will's my name, training ponies is my game.\n[pause]\nRarity: What a darling little catchphrase.\nIron Will: Your friend Fluttershy loved Iron Will's catchphrases. Word on the street is that she doesn't take no guff from nopony! So, Iron Will is here to collect Iron Will's fee.\nPinkie Pie: Fluttershy is in no shape to deal with that creep!\nRarity: [gasps] I'm sure a big, brave, powerful, and rich monster\u2013 I mean, minotaur like you doesn't need that money right away. You can afford to come back later.\nIron Will: Are you kidding? Fluttershy is overdue as it is. Iron Will collects now.\n[thud]\nRarity: Do something!\n[wood crunching]\nPinkie Pie: We're not even sure Fluttershy is home right now. Uh, she might be off frolicking with some woodland creatures. Uh, why don't you give us some time to track her down for ya?\nIron Will: Iron Will does have some grocery shopping to do. Iron Will will come back this afternoon.\nPinkie Pie: But that's only half a day. We need one full day at least.\nIron Will: Iron Will will delay for half a day and no longer!\nPinkie Pie: A full day!\nIron Will: Half day!\nPinkie Pie: Full day!\nIron Will: Half day!\nPinkie Pie: Half day!\nIron Will: Full day!\nPinkie Pie: We need half a day and no more!\nIron Will: Well, you'll get a full day and no less!\nPinkie Pie: Okie-dokie. See you tomorrow.\nIron Will: Wait, what?\nFluttershy: [sneezes]\nIron Will: Huh, sounds like the search won't be necessary. Iron Will collects now.\nPinkie Pie: But we had an agreement! You gotta come back tomorrow!\nIron Will: \"When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!\"\nPinkie Pie: [screams]\n[splash]\nPinkie Pie: [spits]\nWillful Stage Manager: [munching]\n[crunch]\nIron Will: Your payment is overdue, Fluttershy! [knocks]\n[door opens]\nIron Will: [snorts] You were nothing but a doormat, and Iron Will turned you into a lean, mean, assertive machine! Now, pay Iron Will what you owe Iron Will!\nFluttershy: Um, no.\nWillful Stage Manager: [munching]\nWillful Lighting Tech: [bleats]\nIron Will: What did you say?\nFluttershy: No.\nIron Will: Ohhh, I'd hate to be you right now, because Iron Will is gonna rain down a world of hurt unless Iron Will gets his money pronto! [snorts]\nFluttershy: As I recall, during your workshop you promised one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed, or you pay nothing. Well, I'm not satisfied.\nIron Will: What do you mean you're not satisfied?! Everypony has always been satisfied!\nFluttershy: Well, I guess I'm the first then. But since I'm not satisfied, I refuse to pay. It's as simple as that.\n[goats bleating]\nIron Will: Ohh, are you... sure you're not just a little bit satisfied? B-because maybe... we could cut a deal. I-I mean we're both reasonable creatures, aren't we?\nFluttershy: I'm sorry, but no means no.\nIron Will: No means no, huh? Nopony's ever said that to me before. Huh... I gotta remember that one. That's a good catchphrase for my next workshop.\n[goat bleating]\nPinkie Pie: You were amazing, Fluttershy! You totally stood up to that monster!\nRarity: In fact, you didn't change at all! You were the same old Fluttershy that we've always loved!\nPinkie Pie: The one we missed!\nFluttershy: Don't worry, old Fluttershy's back for good. I'm sorry I took the whole assertiveness thing too far. Friends?\nPinkie Pie and Rarity: Friends.\nFluttershy, Pinkie Pie and Rarity: [laughing]\n\nFluttershy: Dear Princess Celestia,\nSometimes it can be hard for a shy pony like me to stand up for myself, and when I first tried it, I didn't like the pony I became. But I've learned that standing up for yourself isn't the same as changing who you are. Now I know how to put my hoof down without being unpleasant or mean.\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nSpike: [sighs] I made it for you, Rarity. Why, yes, it is an ice cream house. Chocolate fudge shingles... rocky road garage...\n[hoof-steps echoing]\nSpike: Huh? Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. Hi, Spike.\nSpike: It's the middle of the night! Why are you pacing like this?\nTwilight Sparkle: Frankly, I don't know how you can sleep at a time like this!\nSpike: Three A.M.?\nTwilight Sparkle: It's awful, it's horrible, it's tragic!\nSpike: Eh... I don't understand. What's wrong?\nTwilight Sparkle: Here. Now do you see what's wrong?\nSpike: We forgot to celebrate Arbor Day?\nTwilight Sparkle: No, the problem is I just finished planning my schedule for the month, but I forgot to leave time to plan for next month! Don't you see? There's no time in my schedule to put together another schedule! I could move my meeting with the Ponyville Hay Board to the following Tuesday, but then I have to reschedule my lunch with Pinkie Pie, and you know what a nightmare she is with scheduling. This is an absolute disaster. My whole year could be thrown off!\nSpike: And I woke up from an ice cream dream for this...\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, my gosh, I think I did it! If I can find a way to read \"The Art of Invisibility Spells\" and \"Thornhoof's Brief History of Canterlot\" at the same time, that could leave me a half-hour scheduling window! Huh?\n[magic crackling, wind blowing]\nTwilight Sparkle: What's going on? [yelps]\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: Twilight, you've got to listen to me!\nTwilight Sparkle: Who are you? I mean, you're me, but I'm me too. How can there be two me's? It's not scientifically possible. You are not scientifically possible!\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: Twilight, please! I have a very important message for you from the future!\nTwilight Sparkle: You're from the future?!\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: That's right, now listen\u2013\nTwilight Sparkle: What happened to you? The future must be awful.\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: Please! I don't have much time!\nTwilight Sparkle: Is there some sort of epic pony war in the distant future or something?\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning, but that's not important right now!\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't believe time travel is really possible! How did you, I mean, I figure it out?\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: The time spells are in the Canterlot archives. But that's not\u2013\nTwilight Sparkle: Really? Where? I've never seen them.\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: They're in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing. Now, you have to listen to\u2013\nTwilight Sparkle: Is time travel fun, or does it hurt? I have so many questions\u2013 [muffled voice]\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: I have something extremely important to tell you about the future, and I only have a few seconds, so you've got to listen! Whatever you do, don't\u2013\n[magic crackling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Future Twilight? Oh no! What was she trying to warn me about? Her clothes, her mane, that scar... Oh, what a mess she is! ...I mean, I am... or I will be... [gasps] She must want me to prevent whatever horrible thing happens in the future! [gasps]\n\nPinkie Pie: C'mon, Fluttershy! The party can't start until the party supplies get there!\nFluttershy: [grunts] Happy to... help... but... can I carry... the balloons next time?\n[crash]\nFluttershy: Oh!\nTwilight Sparkle: Listen, everypony! I've got something really important to say!\nPonies: [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: This is no laughing matter! We have a crisis on our hooves!\nPonies: [gasping]\nTwilight Sparkle: I've just been visited by myself from the future!\nPonies: [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: This isn't a joke! My future self tried to warn me about a horrible disaster that's going to occur sometime before next Tuesday morning!\nApplejack: What kind of disaster?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know! I got sucked back into the future before I could explain!\nPinkie Pie: Run for your liiiiiiiife!\nRarity: What ever should we do, Twilight? How do we stop the disaster if we don't know what it is?\nTwilight Sparkle: We'll just have to work together to make sure we're safe. Rainbow Dash, you and the other Pegasi spread out over Equestria, and look for any kind of problem that could lead to a disaster, and I mean anything.\nRainbow Dash: You got it!\nTwilight Sparkle: Everypony else\u2013\nPinkie Pie: [screaming] Anypony else wanna panic with me? No? [resumes screaming]\nTwilight Sparkle: Everypony else, time to disaster-proof Equestria!\n\n[cement squelching]\n\n[screw squeaking]\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\n[splash]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Done, and done, and done. Applejack, what about the Everfree Forest?\nApplejack: The perimeter's clear.\nTwilight Sparkle: Great.\nRainbow Dash: And my team gave the all clear from Fillydelphia to Las Pegasus.\nTwilight Sparkle: Excellent. Well, we've done everything on the list, but still... Future Twilight looked like she'd been through a horrible ordeal. I just have this nagging feeling we should be looking for something bigger than loose bolts and leaky pipes.\n[Cerberus roaring]\nPinkie Pie: Okay, everypony, follow my lead. [screams]\nPonies: [screaming]\nSpike: What is that thing?!\nTwilight Sparkle: That's Cerberus! He's supposed to be guarding the gates of Tartarus. But if he's here, then all the ancient evil creatures that have been imprisoned there could escape and destroy Equestria!\nSpike: Destroy Equestria?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah! Isn't it great? Hey, Cerberus! You look like you could use some obedience training! Magic obedience training!\n[Cerberus roaring]\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh?\nFluttershy: Who's the cute widdle three-headed dog?\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow, I knew you were good with animals, but this is amazing!\nFluttershy: Aww, he's just a big furry guy who got out of his yard, that's all. Right, Cerberus? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?\nPinkie Pie: [screaming]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie.\nPinkie Pie: [stops screaming] Yes, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Do you have a ball I can borrow?\nPinkie Pie: I have balls stashed all over Ponyville, in case of ball emergency.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sing-song voice] Hey, Cerberus! Look what I have!\n[Cerberus panting]\nTwilight Sparkle: I'll be back as soon as I've returned him to the gates of Tartarus. Once he's back at home, there'll be no disaster.\n\n[rooster crowing]\nSpike: [yawns] I wish Twilight would go on epic adventures more often. Best night's sleep I've had in weeks.\n[door opening and closing]\nSpike: Hey, Twilight. How'd it go with Cerberus?\nTwilight Sparkle: Great. I got him back before any of the evil creatures could escape.\nSpike: Hurrh... hu\u2013 [belches]\nTwilight Sparkle: [yelps] Oh no!\nSpike: What's the big deal, it's just a 'lost dog' flyer. I guess the Princess hasn't heard we found Cerberus yet.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's not that, it's this!\nSpike: A paper cut? Come on, Twilight, you really need to toughen up. Just clean it out and you'll be fine.\nTwilight Sparkle: The cut's in the exact same spot as the scar on future Twilight's cheek! We haven't changed the future at all! The disaster is still coming!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: If the disaster wasn't caused by Cerberus getting loose, then what could it possibly be?\nSpike: [laughs] I dunno, but maybe you ought to give the pacing a rest. You've worn a groove into the floor!\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't have time for another one of your lectures, Spike! This is serious!\nSpike: My lectures?\nTwilight Sparkle: I did everything I could think of to change the future. But it didn't work. So maybe it's not what I do... Maybe it's what I don't do!\nSpike: Huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: If I stand right here and don't move a muscle until next Tuesday, I can't possibly do whatever it is that future Twilight wanted to warn me not to do!\nSpike: Really? So... no matter what happens, you're not gonna move a muscle, huh? Then maybe you won't mind if I... eat an entire tub of ice cream!\n[ice cream splatting]\nSpike: Mmm! [muffled] So good! [eating noisily]\nTwilight Sparkle: [growls] [through gritted teeth] Spike, stop! Think of the stomach ache!\nSpike: [chuckles] Stomach ache, huh? That's future Spike's problem.\n[knocking]\nRainbow Dash: Hey, Twilight, another Pegasus just got back from Baltimare with an all-clear and\u2013 [laughs] What's going on? Aren't you gonna stop him?\nSpike: She sure isn't! In fact, she's not gonna move 'til next Tuesday! She thinks it'll prevent the disaster from happening!\nRainbow Dash: [laughs] Oh, this is too rich. [gasps] Hey, Twilight! There's a mouse right behind you!\nRainbow Dash and Spike: [laughing]\nSpike: Wait, wait, wait, let me try! Whoa-oa\u2013 [belches]\n[whoomph]\nRainbow Dash: Oh no!\nTwilight Sparkle: What happened?\nSpike: I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to! It was a total accident!\nTwilight Sparkle: Show me.\nRainbow Dash: Uhhh... I'm not so sure that's a\u2013\nTwilight Sparkle: Show me! Oh no! This is the same mane cut as future Twilight!\nRainbow Dash: Y'know... it really doesn't look too bad...\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't care how it looks! It's just another sign that the future hasn't changed! Not doing anything didn't work either! Oh, I wish there was a way to know what was going to happen so I could stop it!\nSpike: You wanna see the future? I might know somepony who can help!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: What's this?\nSpike: It's Madame Pinkie's place.\nTwilight Sparkle: Madame Pinkie?\nPinkie Pie: [spookily] Come... Enter the chamber of Madame Pinkie Pie... For the answers you seek, let us consult the mystical orb of fate's destiny... [normal] Do you like my mystical orb of fate's destiny? I just got it. Cool, huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah, uh... best one I've seen.\nPinkie Pie: [spookily] Look deep into the crystal ball... for soon it will reveal all! Ah, yes, I see something... It is a vision of the future... I see... you, Twilight. You will get a really cool birthday present next year...\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, and?\nPinkie Pie: That's it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Are you sure?\nPinkie Pie: Yep. Cool birthday present.\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie, I need your Pinkie Sense to tell me what the impending disaster is that future Twilight was trying to warn me about!\nPinkie Pie: Oh, my fortunetelling has nothing to do with my Pinkie Sense, silly. It's only good for vague and immediate events.\n[crack]\nPinkie Pie: Like that, see? Where did that even come from?\n\nPinkie Pie: Lalalalalalala, lalalala... Gosh, I haven't seen Twilight since the flowerpot incident. Hope she still isn't mad. Uhhhh...\n[papers rustling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Off by point zero two from yesterday. Carry the fifteen... Negative azimuth on the fourteenth moon...\nSpike: Hey Pinkie.\nPinkie Pie: Twilight's really serious about finding out about that cool birthday present, isn't she?\nSpike: Who cares? As long as I can keep eating ice cream. Sorry, future Spike.\nPinkie Pie: [to Twilight] Are... you okay?\nTwilight Sparkle: Ah, Pinkie, I'm glad you're here. Can you help me recalibrate the apertures on the nine-and-quarter catadioptric telescopes?\nPinkie Pie: Sure!\nTwilight Sparkle: So I was thinking, after I came to see Madame Pinkie and the flowerpot landed on my head\u2014see the bandage? Just like the bandage from the future...\nPinkie Pie: Nice!\nTwilight Sparkle: I had an epiphany after that flowerpot. Doing things didn't work, not doing things didn't work, and I couldn't predict the future either, so I only had one other choice. Monitor everything.\nPinkie Pie: Makes sense to me!\nTwilight Sparkle: That way no matter what happens in the future, I'll be ready! I thought I saw something last night in the Horsehead Nebula, but after staring at it for three straight hours, I realized\u2014I was wrong!\nPinkie Pie: Three hours? But when did you sleep?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, I didn't sleep. I haven't slept since future Twilight was here. There are only three days left until next Tuesday, I can sleep all I want after that!\nSpike: You've been awake too long, Twilight.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah. Tuesday's not three days from now, Tuesday's tomorrow!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Pinkie, did you finish recalibrating the apertures on the nine-and-quarter-inch catadioptric telescopes?\nPinkie Pie: I have no idea!\nTwilight Sparkle: Ah! My eye!\nPinkie Pie: Don't worry, Twilight, I have eye patches stashed all over Ponyville, in case of eye patch emergency. There! Now you look like a pirate! A sleepy pirate, with a really weird mane cut.\nTwilight Sparkle: The eye patch...! Another sign! Nearly all the signs have come true! I haven't done a thing to prevent the catastrophe! If Tuesday's tomorrow, and the disaster happens by Tuesday morning, then there's only one solution. I'll just have to... stop time!\n\n[train chugging]\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] Okay, the Canterlot archives are right over there. Let's move!\nSpike: Uhh... I don't think we need to sneak around, Twilight. It's not illegal to walk around Canterlot.\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] Guard! C'mon, you guys! [exhales] That was close.\nSpike: I dunno why we have to wear these things, either.\nPinkie Pie: Aren't we wearing them for fun?\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] No, there's nothing fun about this!\nPinkie Pie: Oh... Are you sure?\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] Focus, guys! The only way to prevent this disaster is to stop time! Time spells are kept in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing, the most secure section of the archives. That's why we're sneaking around!\nPinkie Pie: Awesome! That sounds fun!\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] No, it's not fun!\nPinkie Pie: Aww.\n[rustling]\n[ripping sound]\nPinkie Pie: I still don't understand how sneaking into the archives is gonna help her find out about her birthday present.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] The coast is clear. Now slowly lift me into the window so we can\u2013 AH!\nSpike: [sighs] Let's get this over with.\n\n[splat]\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] Okay, if my calculations are correct, the Star Swirl the Bearded wing should be right... here.\nSpike: Uh, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] What is it, Spike?\nSpike: Isn't this where we came in?\nPinkie Pie: Cool! Can we climb in the window again? That was super fun!\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't understand. It's supposed to be right here... How are we supposed to find it now?\nPinkie Pie: Maybe we should ask somepony in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing?\n[orchestral twang]\n[angelic choir]\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh. How'd I miss that? Look at all those priceless magic scrolls. There are more than I ever imagined!\nPinkie Pie: Twilight, the guard!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] What do we do, what do we do?!\nGuard: Hey, Twilight, haven't seen you in a while. Let me open that for ya.\n[gate squeaking]\nTwilight Sparkle: [chuckles nervously] Thanks!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh no!\n[splat]\nSpike: Oof!\nPinkie Pie: Oh!\nTwilight Sparkle: Look! I look just like future Twilight... The last sign has come true!\nPinkie Pie: And that's bad, right?\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on! It's almost Tuesday morning! The disaster could happen at any moment!\nSpike: But how do we find the time-stopping spell? There must be a million scrolls here!\nTwilight Sparkle: I. Don't. Know!\n[birds singing]\nSpike: Twilight, it's over! It's officially Tuesday morning.\nTwilight Sparkle: Nnngh, no! Tuesday morning, the disaster! Incoming!\nSpike: I dunno, Twilight. I don't see any disasters. Looks like a pretty nice day.\nPrincess Celestia: Good morning, Twilight. Love the new hairstyle. Well, happy Tuesday!\nTwilight Sparkle: Why isn't anypony surprised to see me sneaking around in here?! Is it possible there never was a disaster? That I've just been making myself frantic over nothing?!\nSpike: I don't get it. If future Twilight wasn't warning you about a disaster, then what was she trying to tell you?\nTwilight Sparkle: [giggles] I don't know. But I do know one thing. I look ridiculous.\nSpike and Twilight Sparkle: [laughing]\nSpike: Yeah, you do!\nTwilight Sparkle: And it's all because I couldn't stop worrying and let the future handle itself! Well, not anymore. From now on, I'm gonna solve problems as they come, and stop worrying about every little thing!\nSpike: That's great! Does that mean there won't be any more late night pacing?\nTwilight Sparkle: No more late night pacing. If only I had learned this lesson a week ago, we wouldn't have had to go through all this.\nPinkie Pie: Twilight, Twilight, I found something! It doesn't stop time, but it lets you go back in time. It says you can go back once, and it only lasts for a few moments. Does that help?\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie, you're a genius!\nPinkie Pie: Woo-hoo!\nTwilight Sparkle: Now I can go back and tell past Twilight that she doesn't need to go berserk with worry about a disaster that's never gonna come!\n[magic crackling]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Twilight, you've got to listen to me!\nPast Twilight Sparkle: Who are you? I mean, you're me, but I'm me too. How can there be two me's? It's not scientifically possible. You are not scientifically possible!\nTwilight Sparkle: Twilight, please! I have a very important message for you from the future!\nPast Twilight Sparkle: You're from the future?!\nTwilight Sparkle: That's right, now listen\u2013\nPast Twilight Sparkle: What happened to you? The future must be awful.\nTwilight Sparkle: Please! I don't have much time!\nPast Twilight Sparkle: Is there some sort of epic pony war in the distant future or something?\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning, but that's not important right now!\nPast Twilight Sparkle: I can't believe time travel is really possible! How did you, I mean, I figure it out?\nTwilight Sparkle: The time spells are in the Canterlot archives. But that's not\u2013\nPast Twilight Sparkle: Really? Where? I've never seen them.\nTwilight Sparkle: They're in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing. Now, you have to listen to\u2013\nPast Twilight Sparkle: Is time travel fun, or does it hurt? I have so many questions\u2013 [muffled voice]\nTwilight Sparkle: I have something extremely important to tell you about the future, and I only have a few seconds, so you've got to listen! Whatever you do, don't\u2013\n[magic crackling]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: \u2013waste your time... worrying... about... Ugh! I can't believe I just did that!\nPinkie Pie: Did you tell her about the cool birthday present?\nTwilight Sparkle: Remember last week when future Twilight came to warn me about something? That was me trying to warn myself not to worry so much! Now I'm gonna spend the next week freaking out about a disaster that doesn't even exist! Ugh...\nPinkie Pie: Ah, don't worry about it. It's past Twilight's problem now.\nTwilight Sparkle: [giggles] Huh, I guess you're right, Pinkie.\nSpike: [stomach growls] Ohhh... my stomach... I, I think it's all that ice cream... I thought the stomach ache would be future Spike's problem... but now I am future Spike. Ohh...\nPinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle: [giggling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on, future Spike. Let's get you home.\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[digging sounds]\nTwilight Sparkle: C'mon, Fluttershy, it'll be fun!\nFluttershy: There's nothing fun about dragons! Scary, yes! Fun, no!\nTwilight Sparkle: But Fluttershy, the great dragon migration happens only once in a generation! Do you really wanna pass up a chance like that?\nFluttershy: Now that you put it that way, yes!\nTwilight Sparkle: Aw, Fluttershy, we just don't want you to miss out.\nFluttershy: Miss out on what? Dragons? Big, scaly, fire-breathing dragons?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well... yeah!\nFluttershy: Thanks, but... no thanks!\nRainbow Dash: Look, Fluttershy, I watched that boring butterfly migration with you, so now it's your turn to watch the dragon migration with me! You owe me!\nFluttershy: I... said... no!\nRainbow Dash: Yeaagh! Ugh!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\nFluttershy: [high-pitched growling] [whimpers]\nRainbow Dash: Okay, I guess I'll let you off the hook this time.\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] I don't see any dragons.\nApplejack: [hushed] Me neither.\nPinkie Pie: Me neither neither.\nRainbow Dash: Shoot! You don't think we missed them, do you?\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] No, I don't think so. We're just a little early, and I'm glad we are. This way, we can watch every moment of the migration without bringing any unwanted attention to ourselves!\nRarity: Yoo-hoo! Well?\n[squeaking]\n[party horns]\nRarity: What do you think? Am I the toast of the trench or what?\nApplejack: [hushed] You'll be toast alright, when the dragons see you parading around in that getup.\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] You look very nice, Rarity, but could you maybe look nice down here in the trench with us?\nRarity: Nice is an understatement. I look fabulous! Who says camouflage has to be drab?\nPinkie Pie: [hushed] Ahoy, maties! Dragons ho!\nMain cast: Oooh... ahhhh!\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow, amazing!\nRainbow Dash: Pfft, pretty lame move. Is that all they've got?\n[dragon roaring]\nApplejack: [hushed] What do ya think of that 'move', Rainbow Dash? Still think they're lame?\nRainbow Dash: [hushed] Uh, not so much. The word 'fierce' comes to mind.\nRarity: [hushed] And 'formidable'.\nPinkie Pie: [hushed] And 'super-duper scary'!\nSpike: Yeah. Us dragons are definitely a force to be reckoned with.\nRainbow Dash: [laughs] Yeah, right, Spike. That's one of the scariest aprons I've ever seen!\nApplejack, Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash: [laughing]\nSpike: What's wrong with wearing an apron? You won't be laughing when you spill blueberries all over your scales\u2014 feathers. That's one tough stain!\nRainbow Dash: One tough stain against one lame dragon. [laughs]\nRarity: You leave him alone, Rainbow Dash! Spike's style is unique. He doesn't have to look like other dragons.\nTwilight Sparkle: Or act like them.\nRarity: My little Spikey-wikey is perfect the way he is.\nSpike: I don't act like other dragons?\nPinkie Pie: Oh, not even close!\nApplejack: But why would you want to, Spike?\nRarity: Yes. You've got something those dreadfully fierce dragons can only dream of.\nSpike: What's that?\nRarity: The cutest widdle chubby cheeks! Ooooo!\nSpike: Cute?! Dragons aren't supposed to be cute! Right?\nRarity: Oh, sweetie, you are turning the most delightful shade of red. It is most becoming.\nSpike: Rrrgh!\nRarity: Oh, isn't he adorable when he waddles off in anger?\nSpike: Waddle?! Rrrrrggggh!\n\nSpike: What am I? Where am I from? Who am I supposed to be?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uuugh! I don't know! For the last time, Spike, you were given to me as an egg. I don't know who found you or where they found you.\nSpike: Seriously? That's all you know?\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sorry, Spike.\nSpike: That doesn't tell me anything about who I am! I need answers! I feel like I'm... I'm looking at a complete stranger. Oh!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Spike. Why don't we do some late-night research? See what we can find out.\nSpike: Really? You'd do that?\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course! I'm sure we can find something.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Nothing. Nothing in this one either!\nSpike: Nothing at all about dragons? This is getting ridiculous!\nTwilight Sparkle: I know! It's hard to believe, but ponies know next to nothing about dragons. Apparently they're too rare and too scary to try to talk to or study!\nSpike: I wonder if dragons cry...\nTwilight Sparkle: Aw, Spike.\nSpike: It's okay, Twilight. I'm gonna discover who I am if it's the last thing I do!\nRarity: Yoo-hoo!\nRainbow Dash: Hey, guys!\nSpike: Waugh!\nRarity: Good morning!\nRainbow Dash: Ya wanna join us for breakfast?\nTwilight Sparkle: That sounds great. I'm famished.\nSpike: Count me out. I've gotta get an early start!\nRarity: An early start?\nSpike: Yes! I'm going on a quest of self-discovery! I need to learn what it means to be a dragon! And the only way I'm gonna do that is to join the dragon migration!\nTwilight Sparkle, Rarity, Rainbow Dash: What?!\nRainbow Dash: Spike, that's nonsense talk! I know that you're a dragon, but those dragons mean business! They're big, and tough, and scary...\nSpike: And I'm small, and meek... and I like to wear aprons. See? This is exactly why I need to spend time with them.\nRainbow Dash: All I'm saying is that you could get hurt.\nRarity: Darling, this time I really do have to agree with Rainbow Dash. I don't want those big, ugly, nasty dragons to hurt one little scale on your cutesy-wutesy head!\nSpike: I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind.\nRarity: Oh, uh, quick, do something! Stop him before it's too late!\nSpike: Ngh! Hey! Give it back!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hold it!\nSpike: Whoa!\nRainbow Dash: Aaagh!\nSpike: Really?\nRainbow Dash: Don't tell me you think he should go?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, Spike. I couldn't answer your questions. My books couldn't either. I understand why you want to look elsewhere. I truly believe you need to go on this quest. And we have no right to stop you.\nRarity: I suppose not.\nRainbow Dash: I still say you're nutty, but hey, I've done lots of nutty things.\nRarity, Spike and Twilight Sparkle: We know.\nRainbow Dash: [under her breath] Rrgh.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well then, I guess this is goodbye, Spike. We can't wait to hear about it when you return.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, we hope your trip\u2013\nTwilight Sparkle: Quest.\nRainbow Dash: \u2013your quest answers some of your pesky \"Who am I?\" questions.\nSpike: Thanks, everypony. I know it will.\nRarity: Goodbye, Spikey-wikey!\nRainbow Dash: Go get 'em, big guy!\nTwilight Sparkle: We have faith in you!\nRarity: [through her grin] We're following him, right?\nTwilight Sparkle: [through her grin] Of course.\n\n[wind blowing]\n\n[rain pouring]\n\n[dragon roaring]\n[teacup clinking]\n\nSpike: Ugh!\n\nSpike: Nngh...\n[dragons roaring]\nSpike: [gulps]\n[distant shouting]\nSpike: Alright, teenage dragons! Now that's more my speed. And size.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sounds of exertion]\nRainbow Dash: I'm telling you, we'll never pass for a real dragon!\nRarity: Oh, pish-posh! This costume is fabulous, one of my finer creations.\nTwilight Sparkle: Shh! [hushed] We'll never pass if they hear three voices coming out of one dragon! Now come on, let's go!\n[dragons cheering]\nSpike: Um, excuse me? Uh, hi. I'm Spike.\nFume: You sure your name is Spike and not Shrimp?!\n[dragons laughing]\nSpike: No, it's Spike! I'm not, I mean, I'm sure about that...\n\"Clump\": You look more like a Peewee to me.\n[dragons laughing]\nGarble: Hey guys, c'mon, seriously. Leave him alone or he might fly away. That is, uh, if he had any wings! [laughs]\n[dragons laughing]\n\"Clump\": You fly in on your mommy's back during the migration?\nSpike: Not exactly...\nFume: No, no, can't you see baby Spike just hatched? I bet he still sucks his claw at night!\nSpike: No, I haven't sucked my claw in months!\n[dragons laughing]\nGarble: Well, if you weren't just hatched, how come we haven't seen you around before?\nSpike: Oh, well, y'see, I live in Ponyville and\u2013\nGarble: Hahaha! Ponyville? That explains it! I knew there was something vaguely pony-ish about you! If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were part pony!\nSpike: Who, me? I'm not part pony! I'm all dragon, see? Raar!\nGarble: Or maybe you're a pony in a dragon costume.\n[dragons laughing]\nFume: A pony in a dragon costume...! [laughs]\nTwilight Sparkle: [deep voice] Aheh... yeah... hilarious.\nSpike: Nnh, I am a real dragon!\nGarble: Oh, yeah? Prove it.\nSpike: Well... how?\nGarble: By acting like one! Who's up for a little belching contest?\n[dragons cheering]\n\"Fizzle\": [belches]\nFume: [belches]\n\"Clump\": [belches]\n[dragons cheering]\n\"Clump\": [coughs]\nGarble: You think you can beat that, Peewee?\nSpike: [gulps] [belches]\nTeenage dragons: Huh?\nGarble: From the desk of Princess Celestia. Dear Spike, please te\u2013 Ha! Get this, guys! Spike's pen-pals with a namby-pamby pony princess!\n[dragons laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] How can he just throw that away?! That letter could be something important!\nRainbow Dash: We can't worry about that now, Twilight. We're here to help Spike!\nTwilight Sparkle: I know, I know!\nRainbow Dash: [strained noise]\nTwilight Sparkle: There's no reason to disrespect Princess Celestia that way!\nGarble: Maybe tail wrestling is more your speed.\nSpike: Uh...\nTeenage dragons: Yeah!\n\nGarble: Ready... go!\nBackdraft and Charcoal: [sounds of exertion]\nGarble: The winner!\n[dragons cheering]\nSpike: Good old tail wrestling...\nRarity: We can't let little Spikey-wikey wrestle one of them! He'll get clobbered!\nTwilight Sparkle: Let's go! [deep voice] I challenge Spike to a tail wrestle!\nGarble: Who's this weirdo?\nFume: I think he's Crackle's cousin.\nCrackle: BWAAGH!\nGarble: Oh, that would explain it. Ready? Go!\nSpike: [sounds of exertion]\nGarble: Spike's the winner!\n[dragons cheering]\nGarble: Nice going, little Spike! Maybe you are a dragon after all!\nSpike: Yeah! Maybe I am!\nRarity: Rainbow Dash, I can't believe your silly plan actually worked. Ow.\nSpike: Alright, who's next?\nGarble: Getting a little cocky, huh? I like that. So how about you wrestle... him! Go!\nSpike: Whooooooooa!\n\nGarble: So, Spike, you haven't exactly proven yourself as a dragon yet, have you?\nSpike: But... I get an A for effort?\nGarble: Huh, maybe. Let's see how you do in this next contest.\nSpike: Whaaaaa! Oof! Wha! Oah! Oof!\n[dragons laughing]\nGarble: King of the hoard!\n[dragons cheering]\nSpike: This is my chance.\nFume: [chuckling]\nRainbow Dash: Not so fast!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oof!\n[pinching noise]\n\"Clump\" and Garble: Whoa!\nSpike: King of the ho- whoa! Oof! Uh! Nuh! Oof!\nGarble: Looks like this is another fail for you, little Spike. Can't wait to watch you fail at lava cannonball, too.\nSpike: [gulps]\n\nGarble: Whoever makes the biggest lava splash is the ultimate dragon! Geronimo!\n[splash]\nSpike: Nuh!\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] Spike's on his own this time.\n[dragons cheering]\n\"Clump\": Cannonball!\nSpike: Guh!\nGarble: What's wrong, Spike? You afraid the lava will hurt your soft pony hide?\n[dragons laughing]\nSpike: [gulps] [screams]\n[thwack]\nTeenage dragons: Oooh...\nSpike: Ugh... was I... that bad?\nGarble: No, dude, that was awesome! No pony could live through a belly flop like that! [chuckles] You're one tough little dragon.\nTeenage dragons: [general approval]\n\nCharcoal: [snorts]\nGarble: Spike, by belly flopping so hard, you have proven yourself worthy. I hereby dub you 'rookie dragon', and will now perform the initiation ritual. Rrrrgh. [chuckles] Now let's party dragon style!\n[dragons cheering]\n\n[dragon roars]\nSpike: Man, was that a great party.\nGarble: Great? Huh, maybe by Ponyville standards. Stick with us, Spike. We still got plenty to teach you about being a dragon.\nSpike: I'm not going anywhere. The way I feel right now, I could hang out with you guys forever.\nRainbow Dash, Rarity and Twilight Sparkle: Forever?!\n\nGarble: [sighs]\nRarity: Spikey-wikey is going to stay with these awful dragons? Forever?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh no, this is terrible!\nRainbow Dash: I should've stopped him back at the library when I had the chance!\nTwilight Sparkle: No, Rainbow Dash, this is all my fault! I encouraged him to go!\nGarble: Y'know, Spike, I think you just might be ready for a real dragon raid.\n[dragons cheering]\nGarble: There's a nest full of phoenix eggs nearby, and we're gonna swipe 'em!\n\"Clump\": Aren't you totally psyched to go on this raid?\nSpike: Oh yeah, I'm excited. I mean, I'm psyched.\nGarble: Alright then. Let's fly!\nSpike: Uh, sorry, guys! I guess I'll meet you back here at the crater! After the whole raid thing's over? We'll totally hang then! Whoahoa!\nRainbow Dash: Oh no, they took Spike! We've gotta go after them!\nRarity: [screams]\nTwilight Sparkle: [yelps] Rainbow Dash, stop! We can't fly!\nRarity: And you're ruining my fabulous costume!\nRainbow Dash: I'm sorry, but we gotta help Spike!\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, we're just gonna have to hoof it!\n\nGarble: Alright, Spike. Since you're our rookie dragon, you get to lure the parents away from the nest.\nSpike: Heh... lucky me...\nGarble: Well go on, then!\nSpike: Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Phoenix! I was hoping I could have a word with you? Um, I'd, um, like to ask you some questions actually...\nGarble: [hushed] We haven't got all day, Spike!\nSpike: Hey, you bird brains! Come and get me!\n[phoenix caws]\nSpike: [yelps]\nGarble: What the...\n[phoenix chicks chirping]\nFume: The eggs have hatched.\n\"Clump\": What do we do now?\nGarble: We take the hatchlings, of course!\n[phoenix chicks screeching]\n[phoenix chicks blowing raspberries]\nGarble: Get 'em!\n\nSpike: [continues yelping]\n[phoenix chicks screeching]\nGarble: Ohh... get them!\n[phoenixes screeching]\nGarble: [chuckles] Nnnghh...\nTeenage dragons: Ugh!\nGarble: Nnngh, they got away! I hate that!\n[crash]\nTeenage dragons: Oof!\n\nSpike: Huh, what have we got here? What happened?\nGarble: They got away! Hey! You stole an egg?\nSpike: Uh...\nGarble: Well, I guess the raid wasn't a total waste after all.\n\"Clump\" and Fume: [cheering]\nGarble: Nice going, Spike.\n\"Clump\": Well, what are you waiting for, Spike? Smash it!\nSpike: Smash the egg?\n\"Clump\": Yeah!\nFume: Yeah, throw it on the ground as hard as you can!\nTeenage dragons: Yeah! Smash it! Smash it! Smash it! Smash it! Smash it!\nSpike: No! It's just a defenseless egg, like I was! And I'm not gonna let you hurt it!\nGarble: What did you say?\nSpike: I said no.\nGarble: No one says no to me. [growls]\nRainbow Dash: Nopony's gonna lay a claw on him!\nTwilight Sparkle: That's right!\nRarity: Fighting's not really my thing, I'm more into fashion, but I'll rip you to pieces if you touch one scale on his cute little head!\n[dragons laughing]\nGarble: Ooh, scary, hehe! Spike, are these namby-pamby ponies your friends?\nSpike: Yes, they are. And they're better friends than you could ever be. Now, if you don't back off, you'll see what us ponies do when confronted by a huge group of jerky dragons.\nGarble: Oh, yeah? [snorts] What's that?\nSpike: Run away!\nGarble: [growls]\nTwilight Sparkle: Nyuh!\n[crash]\n\nRainbow Dash, Rarity, Spike and Twilight Sparkle: [yelps]\nSpike: Phew, that was a close one. Thanks, you guys.\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course. What are friends for?\nSpike: You're more than friends. You're my family.\nRarity: [squeaks]\n\nSpike: Dear Princess Celestia,\nSeeing the great dragon migration made me wonder what it meant to be a dragon. But now I realize that who I am is not the same as what I am. I may have been born a dragon, but Equestria and my pony friends have taught me how to be kind, loyal, and true! I'm proud to call Ponyville my home, and to have my pony friends as my family.\n\nYours truly,\nSpike\n\n[egg cracking]\n[phoenix chick chirping]\nSpike: Aww. [chuckles] Hey, welcome to the family, Peewee! Stick with me. I've got plenty to teach you about being a pony.\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nRainbow Dash: Calling all Pegasus ponies! Meeting tonight!\nFlitter: [reading] \"Mandatory meeting for all Ponyville Pegasi.\"\nRainbow Dash: Library, tonight. Be cool or be mule. No offense.\nMule: None taken.\n\nRainbow Dash: All right, go on in, find a seat. [groan] You too, Fluttershy. Come on, let's go.\n\n[theme song]\n\n[film projector running]\n[old music begins playing]\nFilm announcer: Every living thing depends on the life-giving nourishment of rainwater, and it is up to Cloudsdale to provide rain-filled clouds to every corner of Equestria. But how, one pony might ask, does Cloudsdale gather all this extra water? Tornado power! That's right, Pegasi-driven tornado power. A team of Pegasi combine their wing power to create a jumbo tornado, powerful enough to pull water out of the local reservoir and funnel it all the way up to Cloudsdale. Remember, Pegasi, your jumbo tornado must reach a minimum of eight hundred wing power to lift that water up to Cloudsdale. So, the next time you're wondering \"Where does all that extra rainwater come from?\", just remem\u2013\n[music and voice suddenly halt]\nPegasi: [confused chatter]\nSpike: Uh... intermission?\nRainbow Dash: So, here's the scoop. Cloudsdale has chosen our own highland reservoir as a source of the rainwater they need for all of Equestria. And you know what that means. It means it's up to Ponyville's Pegasi to bring that water up to Cloudsdale.\nPegasi: [excited chatter]\nRainbow Dash: Not only that, but Spitfire, captain of the Wonderbolts, will be here to oversee the water transfer and record our top tornado windspeed. Now last year, Fillydelphia broke the windspeed record with a top speed of nine hundred and ten wing power. But I think we can do better. I think we can get a top speed over a thousand!\nPegasi: [excited chatter]\nRainbow Dash: ...if each and every pony trains, and trains hard to get their wing power numbers up.\nThunderlane: [coughing]\nRainbow Dash: That coughing better be from a popcorn kernel, Thunderlane. Nopony's getting sick on my watch. So, are we gonna train hard?\nPegasi: Yeah!\nRainbow Dash: Are we gonna be strong?\nPegasi: Yeah!\nRainbow Dash: Are we gonna be fast?\nPegasi: Yeah!\nRainbow Dash: Record-smashing fast?\nBulk Biceps: YEAH!\nRainbow Dash: Who's with me?\nPegasi: Woo-hoo! [cheering]\nRainbow Dash: Fluttershy!\n\nRainbow Dash: Stretch those glutes, Flitter! Nice flexibility, Cloud Chaser. A... little too much flexibility, Blossomforth. Uh, somepony give Blossomforth a hoof. Let's see some faster trotting, Thunderlane! Good pace, Silverspeed! [blows whistle] Keep it up! We're gonna need all the wing power we can get to break that record!\nBulk Biceps: YEAH! [snorts]\nRainbow Dash: Good work, everypony! [under her breath] Everypony except Fluttershy.\n\nRainbow Dash: [knocking] Fluttershy? I know you're in there! You're avoiding tornado duty and I want to know why! Fluttershy, open\u2013\nFluttershy: Achoo. Hi, Rainbow Dash. [coughs weakly]\nRainbow Dash: Fluttershy, what happened to you?\nFluttershy: Oh, I [sniffs] I think I have [coughs weakly] the pony pox. I'm sorry. I really, really wanted to come to training day today [coughs weakly], but this pony pox has really knocked me for a loop. Achoo. [coughs weakly]\nRainbow Dash: Oh, you poor thing. You know, there's only one cure for pony pox.\nFluttershy: I know, plenty of bed\u2013\n[splash]\nFluttershy: [yelps]\nRainbow Dash: Cold water! Those pony pox are clearing right up.\nFluttershy: Oh, y'know, all of a sudden, I'm, I'm starting to feel better. [laughs nervously] I'll just get out of these robes and\u2013 ow! Oh, my wing, oh, ow, it's hurt. I guess I can't fly after all\u2013\nRainbow Dash: [blows whistle]\nFluttershy: [yelps]\nRainbow Dash: Messed up wing, huh? Stop horsing around, Fluttershy. We've got a lot of training to do. Come on now, what's going on?\nFluttershy: Well, y'see, uh, well... oh, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it! I can't fly!\nRainbow Dash: What are you talking about? Just last week you went into that wicked nose dive to save that falling baby bird right before it hit the ground!\nFluttershy: But that was different, that was an emergency! This whole tornado thing, it's more like a performance, and you know how I hate performing in front of others. Don't you remember flight camp? I couldn't gallop hard or fly fast, not with everypony looking at me!\nRainbow Dash: It wasn't that bad.\nFluttershy: You're right, Rainbow Dash, it wasn't bad. It was horrible!\n\nFilly Fluttershy: [gasping] [yelps]\nFluttershy: [voiceover] The other foals used to tease me, a lot!\nFoals: [chanting] Fluttershy, Fluttershy, Fluttershy can hardly fly!

This is no time for\u2013 I mean, confidence or no confidence, I'm gonna need every Pegasus to break the record, including you. I need every ounce of wing power I can get.\nFluttershy: Oh, I-I don't think so, Rainbow Dash...\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Thanks anyway.\nFluttershy: Wait. I'll do it.\nRainbow Dash: You will?\nFluttershy: I will.\nRainbow Dash: You're game?\nFluttershy: I'm game.\nRainbow Dash: Alright!\n\n[anemometer squeaking]\nCloud Chaser: What exactly does this machine do?\nTwilight Sparkle: This is an anemometer. It measures your accelerative velocity and translates it into wing power, thus gauging your cumulative H2O anti-gravitational potential. Any other questions?\nFlitter: Yeah. [to Spike] What exactly does this machine do?\nSpike: It tells you how fast you're flying and how strong your wings are.\nPegasi: [Oooh. Ok, yeah.]\n[cough]\nTwilight Sparkle: Is that you again, Thunderlane? Please, we need to have a germ-free environment.\nThunderlane: It wasn't me, it was Blossomforth.\nRainbow Dash: Don't worry, Twilight. Thunderlane's just cooking up an excuse to spend tornado day in bed. Why don't you get over here and be our first test flyer, Thunderlane?\nBlossomforth: [coughs]\nThunderlane: [revving sounds]\n[anemometer squeaking]\nTwilight Sparkle: We have 9.3 wing power.\nPegasi: Wow! That's fast!\nBulk Biceps: YEAH!\nRainbow Dash: Not bad, not bad. [joints cracking] [revving sounds]\n[anemometer squeaking]\nTwilight Sparkle: 16.5 wing power!\nPegasi: [cheering]\nRainbow Dash: Now listen up! If each of you can get your numbers up to at least 10.0 wing power by the end of the week, we'll no doubt set a new tornado speed record. We'll be number one!\nPegasi: [cheering]\n\n[anemometer squeaking]\nRainbow Dash: Impressive. Fluttershy, your turn.

You aren't gonna go quit just because of that, are you?\nFluttershy: [crying] Yes!\nRainbow Dash: But I need you!\nFluttershy: I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just [between sobs] don't have the courage right now...\n\nFluttershy: [squeaks] [crying]\n[squirrel chittering]\nFluttershy: [sniffles] Oh, thank you, but I'm afraid a couple of little acorns won't solve my big flying problem.\n[duck quacking]\nFluttershy: I tried, but you should've seen those ponies laughing at me...\n[birds chirping]\nFluttershy: I know it's important to have confidence in myself...\n[badger squeaking]\nFluttershy: Yes, yes, I do remember. The river was swelling...\n[badger squeaking]\nFluttershy: ...and you were scared...\n[badger squeaking]\nFluttershy: ...yes, I did tell you to never give up... and to believe in yourself.

That has to be some kind of mistake! I worked so hard!\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy, that's a huge improvement!\nRainbow Dash: You did awesome, Fluttershy.\nFluttershy: No, I didn't. I thought I'd gotten over my nerves, but they still got the best of me! There's no way I'll fly with 10.0 wing power tomorrow!\nRainbow Dash: So you won't fly with 10.0 wing power. Every bit counts!\nFluttershy: How would you feel if everypony else was flying with 10.0 wing power and you were flying with 2.5?\nSpike: Actually, it was only 2.3, and\u2013 ow!\n[zipping noise]\nRainbow Dash: Well, uh... I'd feel... um...\nFluttershy: Exactly! Humiliated! [between sobs] I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it!\nSpike: It's okay, Rainbow Dash, you've still got plenty of wing power for your tornado. You'll be able to lift tons of water up to Cloudsdale!\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] If only there was a way to lift Fluttershy out of the dumps.\n\n[ponies cheering]\nRainbow Dash: Are we ready to do this?\nPegasi: Yeah! [cheering]\nSpike: Look!\nRainbow Dash: Lazy Thunderlane! Where is he?! He's been trying to get out of tornado duty the whole time with his fake coughing and all. Rumble, where's your lazy brother?\nRumble: He's got the feather flu. He's down at Ponyville Hospital.\nSpike: But he's not the only one.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Let's see, with those eight sick Pegasi out with the feather flu...

Forget the record. Cloudsdale still needs water! Okay, everypony! Let's give it all we've got! On the sound of the horn, we take off!\nTwilight Sparkle: [taps giant anemometer]\nSpike: [takes deep breath, blows horn]\n[wind howling]\n[giant anemometer squeaking]\nSpike: You think they're gonna make it to eight hundred wing power?\nTwilight Sparkle: I sure hope so!

Five hundred wing power!\n[water churning]\nTwilight Sparkle: Seven hundred and fifty wing power!\nFluttershy: Twilight!\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy! What are you doing here?!\nFluttershy: I figured... if I couldn't help Rainbow Dash with the tornado... the least I could do was offer moral support!\nTwilight Sparkle: She could sure use it, considering eight Pegasi are sick with the feather flu!\nFluttershy: Oh no! That's terrible news!\n[water splashing]\n[crunch]\nPegasi: Whoa!

You should quit, it's not safe!\nRainbow Dash: No! One more time! I've gotta know we gave it our all! If I'm going down, I'm going down flying! C'mon, ponies, let's make this happen!\nPegasi: [cheering]\nBulk Biceps: YEAH!\nSpike: [blows horn]\n[wind howling]\n[giant anemometer squeaking]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, here we go... one hundred wing power! Two hundred! Five hundred!\nRainbow Dash: Stay in position! Flap those wings! Faster!\nTwilight Sparkle: Seven hundred! Seven hundred and fifty wing power!\nSpike: [yelps] They fell apart right after this!\nFluttershy: Oh, I'm too nervous to look!\nRainbow Dash: C'mon! Just a little harder! I can see the water trying to funnel through!\nTwilight Sparkle: Seven ninety five! We are so close! Fluttershy, they need you up there!\nFluttershy: I won't make a difference!\nTwilight Sparkle: You can make a difference!\nFluttershy: My measly 2.3 wing power is still too little!\nSpike: It's sticking at seven ninety five! I don't know if they've got any more in 'em!\nTwilight Sparkle: Do it for Equestria! Do it for Rainbow Dash! Do it for yourself!\nFluttershy: [gulps] [yelps]\nTwilight Sparkle: It's moving! She's doing it! Seven ninety eight! She surpassed her best wing power number!\nFoals: [echoing] Fluttershy, Fluttershy, Fluttershy can hardly fly!

They all did it!\nSpike: [blows horn]\nPegasi: [cheering]\nRainbow Dash: Whoa, girl, take it easy!\nFluttershy: Whuh, what? Did we do it?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, we did it! You did it!\nFluttershy and Rainbow Dash: Ah!\nFlitter: Great job, Fluttershy, that was awesome!\nCloud Chaser: Yeah, we couldn't have done it without you.\nSpitfire: Nice job, Rainbow Dash. You may not have set a new record, but you showed a lot of guts.\nRainbow Dash: Thanks, but if you wanna talk guts, then you've gotta give it to my number one flyer, Fluttershy! Let's hear it for Fluttershy!\nPegasi: [chanting] Fluttershy! Fluttershy! Fluttershy can really fly! [cheering]\n\nFluttershy: Dear Princess Celestia,\nSometimes you can feel like what you have to offer is too little to make a difference, but today, I learned that everypony's contribution is important, no matter how small.

Gotta run!\nScootaloo: Maybe there's something to this newspaper idea.\nSweetie Belle: Guess it's worth a shot...\n\n[paper ripping]\n\n[bubbling]\n\nSweetie Belle: Apple Bloom. Your newspaper idea was nothing but a big bust.\nScootaloo: We tried everything, from papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 to making birds' nests, and nothing worked.\nApple Bloom: [laughs]\nSweetie Belle: What's so funny?\nApple Bloom: What I meant was, we should write for the paper! We can get our cutie marks as journalists!\nScootaloo and Sweetie Belle: [groan]\n\n[theme song]\n\nCheerilee: Okay, class, see you tomorrow! Oh, for those of you who want to join the newspaper staff, stay here, because we're meeting right now!\nApple Bloom: Cutie marks in journalism!\nScootaloo: Such a good idea.\nCheerilee: Welcome, everypony. Now, as you know, our editor-in-chief graduated last year\u2013\nSweetie Belle: Oh, oh, oh, ohohohoh!\nCheerilee: Yes?\nSweetie Belle: What's an editor-in-chief?\nCheerilee: Good question, Sweetie Belle. I like those reporter's instincts. The Foal Free Press is a student-run paper. I'm only involved as an adviser, so the editor-in-chief is the pony in charge, from choosing the stories to making sure it gets to press on time. Now, as I said, we have a new editor this year!\n[door opens]\nStudents: Diamond Tiara?!\nDiamond Tiara: Hm.\nCheerilee: I'll leave you alone now to discuss everypony's assignments. Have fun!\n[door closes]\nDiamond Tiara: Alright, listen up. The Foal Free Press is a joke.\nStudents: Huh?\nDiamond Tiara: Nopony at this school takes it seriously. Well I, the editor-in-chief in charge, am going to deliver us to newfound glory!\n[pause]\nTruffle: Yay!\nDiamond Tiara: First things first. Where's the staff photographer? Get out there and document everything. I'll decide what's important.\n[door closes]\nDiamond Tiara: The rest of you, I want hard-hitting news and interesting think pieces. No more Namby-Pamby stories like last year's editor.\n\"Ruby Pinch\": But Namby-Pamby was a great editor.\nDiamond Tiara: Well, there's a new regime now, and I want juicy stories. The juicier, the better! Now get out there and report!\nScootaloo: Let's get out of here, girls. Maybe we can try packing boxes again.\nSweetie Belle: But this could be our last chance to earn our cutie marks! If we really are supposed to be journalists, isn't it worth a little grief?\nScootaloo: I guess you're right. We can take a little bit of Diamond Tiara for a lifetime of cutie marks.\nSweetie Belle: C'mon! Let's go get these marks!\n\nSweetie Belle: [voiceover] My first story's going to be an exclusive interview.\n\nScootaloo: [voiceover] I saw a brand new nest of baby birds the other day.

I reckon I'll do a piece on the history of Ponyville.\n\n[typewriter clicking]\n[ink squirting]\nDiamond Tiara: I hope you've got something, because everything so far is unusable. \"Baby Birds Born\"? \"Rarity's Hot New Hat\"? \"Ponyville: The Early Years\"!? Oh! I don't know what you call this, but it sure isn't news!\nSweetie Belle: We just... thought...\nDiamond Tiara: Get something else on my desk by the end of the day, and it better be juicy!\nScootaloo: Now what? Do you know what I had to do to get that story?\nApple Bloom: Oh, you don't even wanna know what I had to sit through.\n[camera snapping]\nSnips: Oh! Get it off me, Snails!\nSnails: Eh, you get it off me, Snips?\nSnips: Aah! Stop it! You are making it worse! Nah! Oh, great.\nSnails: I'll get it. [grunt]\nSnips: Aah!\nSnails: Get it off!

We finally got the gum out! [laughs]\n\nDiamond Tiara: Your column is a sensation! I don't want you doing news anymore. I want more columns like this. Columns about ponies and their private lives, the things they do when they think they're alone. You three are my new gossip columnists! And I love the way you signed it! \"Gabby Gums\"... [sigh] That was a stroke of genius!\nSweetie Belle: We couldn't fit all of our names, so we decided to create one for all three of us.\nDiamond Tiara: Well, I want more Gabby Gums! Nice work, girls.\nScootaloo: But we sure seem to have a gift for gossip.\nSweetie Belle: If we can write a few more of these Gabby Gums columns, we'll earn our cutie marks for sure!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Woo-hoo!\n\nSweetie Belle: Scootaloo? Do you have anything?\nScootaloo: Nope.\nSweetie Belle: Apple Bloom?\nApple Bloom: [sighs] Sorry.\nScootaloo: Let's face it, nothing very juicy happens at this school.\nSnips and Snails: [grunts]\n[thwack]\nSweetie Belle: We're doomed.\n\n[thud]\nRarity: Ohh, Sweetie Belle...

I've never heard of her before. Is she a new\u2013\n\nSweetie Belle: We gave up too quickly, girls. Forget trying to squeeze stories out of this school.

Come on, relax, have a hooficure, it feels amazing.\nRainbow Dash: [swallows] Did you forget who you're talking to? The day I get a hooficure is the day I turn in my daredevil license. Besides, I haven't read this Gabby Gums yet.\nSpike: Well, do it quietly, will ya?

Gabby Gums doesn't value anypony's privacy.\nRarity: Oh, lighten up, Twilight, it's nothing but harmless gossip!\n[splash]\nPinkie Pie: Yeah, Twilight, I mean listen to this one. \"Mayor Not Naturally Gray!\" The Mayor in a mane dyeing scandal? Who wouldn't wanna read that?\nTwilight Sparkle: I just can't help feeling sorry for the ponies featured in her columns. It's gotta be a little embarrassing.\nRainbow Dash: Are you kidding? Do you know how awesome it is to get your name in the paper?\nRarity: Rainbow, why don't you join me in one of these delicious hooficures?\nRainbow Dash: It's that good, huh? Well, maybe just one little hoof.\n[chords]\nRainbow Dash: [yelps] Forget it, I don't like ponies touching my hooves. Man...

Spike opens up about Canterlot, naps, and his favorite jams!\"\nScootaloo: It's our best column yet!\nDiamond Tiara: More like your worst column yet! Gabby Gums didn't become the biggest thing in Ponyville with namby-pamby stories like this!\nApple Bloom: [sighs] Yeah, she's right. This column is a little softer than our usual gossip.\nSweetie Belle: Were you guys feeling guilty about all the gossip too? Like... maybe we could be hurting other ponies' feelings?\nApple Bloom: Yeah, I didn't wanna say anything because everypony loves Gabby Gums so much, but... I was sorta hoping we could start writing more stories like this one.\nScootaloo: Me too.\nSweetie Belle: If we're gonna get our cutie marks, we've got to give the ponies what they want.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Awww...\n\n[paper spinning noise]\nApplejack: \"Applejack Asleep on the Job!\" Can y'all believe this?!

Gabby Gums made that up! I never said anything like that!\nRarity: Everypony, please! She's just a harmless schoolpony engaged in a little harmless gossip. You're really making too big a deal out of this.\nTwilight Sparkle: But it's all lies! Gabby Gums prints whatever she wants!

So she tweaks a few ponies every now and then. Maybe they deser\u2013 [gasps] I'll destroy her! \"The Drama-Queen Diaries\"... She's reprinted my diary! How could Gabby Gums possibly get access to my private diary?!\nTwilight Sparkle: We've got to put a stop to this once and for all! Sweetie Belle's on the newspaper staff. Maybe she knows who Gabby Gums is.\nRarity: [gasps] My sister would never associate with anyone as beastly as Gabby Gums! I resent you even suggesting such a thing, Twilight! Why, she's the most innocent, most lovely\u2013\n\nRarity: \u2013most evil pony in Equestria! How could my own sister steal my private diary? How could my own sister be...

How'd you find out?!\nRarity: The gilded pages of your betrayal!\nSweetie Belle: Oh, yeah.\nRarity: How could you do this to me?! You stole my secret diary and published it for all the world to read! Gossip can be a very hurtful thing. It is an invasion of privacy, just like when I snooped through your saddlebag. You didn't like that much, did you?\nSweetie Belle: No...\nRarity: What is important is that you understand how your column makes the ponies that you're writing about feel!\nSweetie Belle: I do understand, and we've all been feeling guilty, but we just want our cutie marks so badly!\nRarity: Do you really think that writing nasty things and making everypony feel horrible is your destiny?\nSweetie Belle: Well, when you put it that way...\n\nDiamond Tiara: No! I won't let you quit!\nSweetie Belle: But the gossip we've been printing is hurting everypony's feelings!\nDiamond Tiara: Feelings?! I don't care about feelings!

And if Gabby Gums really does go into retirement, I'll need something to fill that empty column space. Now get out there and bring me more Gabby Gums!\n\nSweetie Belle: We'll find a way out of this, girls.\nScootaloo: Maybe Rainbow Dash will have a story for us. She's always good for some gossip.\nApple Bloom: Rainbow Dash! Hey, Rainbow Dash!\nRainbow Dash: Well, if it isn't Gabby Gums!\nSweetie Belle: You heard too, huh?\nRainbow Dash: Are you kidding?

You're not mad at us too, are you?\nApplejack: Eeyup.\nApple Bloom: You're not even gonna talk to us?\nApplejack: Nnope.\nBig McIntosh: You should be ashamed of yourself, humiliatin' your sister 'n' me like that.

But this will be my final piece. We want to apologize for the pain and embarrassment we've caused.\nApple Bloom: Y'see, I'm actually three little fillies, Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo.\nScootaloo: As the popularity of our column grew, we got swept up in the hype. We knew that what we were doing didn't feel quite right, but we ignored the guilt because everypony seemed to want to read what we were writing.\nSweetie Belle: From now on, we promise to respect everypony else's privacy, and we won't engage in hurtful gossip any more.\nApple Bloom: All we can do is ask for your forgiveness, Ponyville.\n\nSigning off for the very last time,\nXOXO, Gabby Gums\n\nCheerilee: Well, staff, I guess I gave a little too much authority to a first-time editor.

Should we start looking for clues?\nPinkie Pie: Perfect silly question, my dear Twilight, because the obvious answer is...\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes?\nPinkie Pie: No! 'Cause I know who did it.\n[gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie, how could you possibly know?\nPinkie Pie: How could I possibly not know? Clearly this dastardly deed was done by the baker who knew their dessert could not measure up to the mastery of the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. I guess you feared your \u00e9clairs lacked flair, Gustave!\n\n[silent film music]\n\nPinkie Pie: Thus, destroying the cake and the Cakes' chance of winning the National Dessert Competition.\nTwilight Sparkle: But it makes no sense!\nPinkie Pie: What do you mean, lowly assistant?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, first, if you were tied to the train tracks, how are you now here?\nPinkie Pie: Huh... Guess that isn't a totally silly question.\nTwilight Sparkle: And second, the cake hasn't been sliced. It's been bitten. Just look at the teeth marks!\nPinkie Pie: Hm... You're right, my fine fellow. Gustave le Grand is clearly in the clear, which means the \"MMMM\" was destroyed by another baker. A baker whose donuts are do-nots. That's right, it was Joe!\n\n[spy music]\nPinkie Pie: [voiceover] Or as he's known in the spy world, Mane. Con Mane.\n[giggles]\n[beeps]\n[spraying noise]\n[thud]\n[laser noise]\n\nPinkie Pie: Crushing the Cakes' chances to win!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie! There is no laser beam security system! And Joe is not sleek, stealthy Con Mane! He's big, gruff, and messy!\nDonut Joe: Hey!\nRarity: Although, you would look rather dapper in a tuxedo.\nPinkie Pie: Huh... You may be right, lowly assistant.\nTwilight Sparkle: May be?\nPinkie Pie: Now that I'm taking a closer look at these desserts, I see that one simply cannot look me in the eye.\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie... that moose is a mousse!\nPinkie Pie: Yes, and the mule behind the moose panicked when she saw the mastery of the \"MMMM\".\nTwilight Sparkle: So you're saying that the culprit is...\nPinkie Pie: Mulia Mild!\n\n[flute and percussion sounds]\n[clang]\n[cutting sounds]\n\nPinkie Pie: Putting an end to the Cakes' dreams of taking first prize. Huh, I hope you're proud of yourself, Mulia.\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie, stop! This is ridiculous! Look at her!\nMulia Mild: [whimper]\nPinkie Pie: [sigh] I guess you're right...\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you!\nPinkie Pie: But I was so sure that it was one of the other bitter bakers that destroyed the \"MMMM\". That way, their delicious dessert would reign supreme. I mean, just look at Joe's Donutopia. It's a spectacular city of donutty delight, topped temptingly in sprinklicious sprinkles. And Gustave's \u00e9clairs look incredibly edible, with glistening glaziness. But then there's Mulia Mild's Mousse Moose. [sighs] why, this mouth-wateringly marvelous mousse moose tempts the taste buds with its silky, smooth, yummy-nummy, chocolateyness. So why did this criminal devour the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness while leaving this trio of tasty treats untouched?\n[munching sounds]\n[scream]\nPinkie Pie: [gasp] Now I have no idea who do-doned it!\n\nPinkie Pie: This mystery gets more mysterious every minute.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, you have to stop the wild accusations and get to the truth. Everypony go back to your cars while we do a little investigating. Okay, Pinkie, in order to really solve this mystery, we're going to have to find clues. Now you were here at the scene of the crime all night.\nPinkie Pie: Huh! You're not accusing me, are you?\nTwilight Sparkle: No! But maybe you saw something that will help us.\nPinkie Pie: I saw a silhouette in the moonlight!\nTwilight Sparkle: Good... Let's retrace your steps.\n\nPinkie Pie: And then I chased the culprit down the train towards the caboose, but when I got there, he was gone.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hm... A-ha! Our first clue. I think I know who did it, Pinkie.\nPinkie Pie: Already?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, but I need more evidence to confirm. Tell me what happened next.\nPinkie Pie: I heard somepony else in the dessert car and chased them up to the engine...\n\nPinkie Pie: ...But, when I got there, all I saw was the conductor shoveling coal.\nTwilight Sparkle: The conductor, huh? [gasp] But that doesn't make any sense. What happened next, Pinkie?\nPinkie Pie: Well... I went back to the dessert car.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes?\nPinkie Pie: The curtains mysteriously closed, all on their own.\nTwilight Sparkle: Interesting. Anything else?\nPinkie Pie: I heard hoofsteps, a loud thud...\n[thud]\nPinkie Pie: ...and then they were gone! When I opened the curtains, I saw that the portrait by the door was all crooked.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh my, what is that?\nPinkie Pie: [growling]\n[teapot whistling]\nTwilight Sparkle: What next Pinkie?\nPinkie Pie: That's it. I was here guarding the cake the rest of the night. I mean... I slept by the cake the rest of the night.\nTwilight Sparkle: And when you woke up, half the cake was gone?\nPinkie Pie: Exactly.\nTwilight Sparkle: By Jove, I think I've got it. Call everypony back. We have a cake culprit to catch.\n\nMulia Mild: [stuttering] Why are we all here again?\nTwilight Sparkle: I bet you're wondering why you're all here again.\nDonut Joe: She's good.\nTwilight Sparkle: We have discovered the true culprit of this cake carnage.\nGustave le Grand: But how?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, you see, when committing a crime, it's crucial that one never leaves behind clues, especially an obvious clue like... this.\n[gasp]\nPinkie Pie: A-ha! A blue feather! I knew it was you, Gustave le Grand!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie, Gustave doesn't have blue feathers.\nPinkie Pie: No, 'cause he's been dyeing them!\nTwilight Sparkle: No, Pinkie. Remember how when you chased the suspect to the caboose, they suddenly disappeared? That's because they flew away. But the thief did leave a little something behind, didn't you, Rainbow Dash?\nRainbow Dash: I-I don't even like cake!\nPinkie Pie: So Rainbow Dash did it! Case solved!\nTwilight Sparkle: Case not solved, because when we went to the engine, I saw the conductor's hat. And inside the hat was... this.\nPinkie Pie: So it was you! That pink hair came from your rainbow-colored mane!\nRainbow Dash: I don't have pink in my mane, Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie: So you're wearing a wig?\n[stretching noises]\nRainbow Dash: Ow! Cut it out!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie, remember? You chased a pony to the engine, where you thought you saw the conductor shoveling coal, but that wasn't the conductor at all. It was... Fluttershy!\nFluttershy: [gasp] Oh my.\nPinkie Pie: You're goin' down, Fluttershy!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie! But then another clue confounded my suspicions. You were guarding the cake when the curtains mysteriously closed. But that's no mystery, that's magic. But when the thief tried to make their great escape, they left a little addition to the portrait. Has anypony else noticed that Rarity is wearing her hair rather differently today?\nRarity: [gasp] What? Is it a crime to change one's style now and again? Why, I think it's a crime not to.\nTwilight Sparkle: Really?\nRarity: Fine, I'm guilty! [crying] I wear false eyelashes! Oh, and I took a bite of the cake.\nFluttershy: So did I.\nRainbow Dash: Aw nuts, so did I.\nRarity: You just made it sound so delectable.\nFluttershy: So tasty.\nRainbow Dash: And boy was it!\nRarity: I only meant to take a little, lady-like bite.\nFluttershy: And it was so good.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, I just dove right in!\nFluttershy: But I'm really really sorry.\nRarity: Terribly sorry.\nRainbow Dash: Sorry, Pinkie.\nPinkie Pie: That's okay. At least this mystery is finally solved.\nTwilight Sparkle: But it isn't. We figured out who ate the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, but we still don't know who devoured the other bakers' goods.\nPinkie Pie: You're right, Twilight. You know what we have to do?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well... Yes, I do. Do you?\nPinkie Pie: Look for clues! [sniffing] Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, Pinkie. Did you find the devourer of the desserts?\nPinkie Pie: I most certainly did. It was none other than... the bakers!\n[gasp]\nPinkie Pie: First of all, Gustave has mousse in his moustache! And Joe has \u00e9clair in his hair! And Mulia has sprinkles in her wrinkles!\nTwilight Sparkle: What do you say, bakers?\nGustave le Grand: Oh, I am so sorry, Mulia, but Pinkie made your mousse moose sound... tr\u00e8s magnifique.\nDonut Joe: And Pinkie's description of your \u00e9clairs really did make 'em sound scrumptious.\nMulia Mild: And the way she spoke of your Donutopia, ohh, was too delectable to resist.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, everypony, we finally have the mystery solved.\nGustave le Grand: Yes, but now we don't have any desserts to enter into ze contest!\nPinkie Pie: I think we can fix that. Come on!\n\nPinkie Pie: Dear Princess Celestia,\nToday I learned that it is not good to jump to conclusions. You have to find out all the facts before saying somepony did something. If you don't, you could end up blaming somepony for something they never did. This could hurt their feelings, and it can make you look really foolish. So from now on, I will always make sure to get all the facts.\n\nPinkie Pie: How's that for a lesson, Princess Celestia?\nTwilight Sparkle: Care for a bite?\nPinkie Pie: I don't mind if I do.\n[munching sounds]\nPinkie Pie: Mmmmm.\n[laughter]\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nRarity: Ahh!\n[running footsteps]\nRarity: It is gorgeous out.

Fluttershy, I would like you and your songbird choir to provide the music.\nFluttershy: Oh my goodness!

See you all very soon. Yours, Princess Celestia. But... I don't understand. Who's getting married?\nSpike: Oh, wait! Uh, I was probably supposed to give you this one first.\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and... [gasp] My brother?!\n\n[theme song]\n\nApplejack: Your brother's getting married? Congratulations, Twilight! That's great news!\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah, great news. That I just got from a wedding invitation! Not from my brother, but from a piece of paper! Thanks a lot, Shining Armor. I mean, really, he couldn't tell me personally? [as Shining Armor] Hey, Twilight, just thought you should know I'm making a really big decision that changes everything. Oh, never mind, you'll hear about it when you get the invitation. [normal] Princess Mi Amore Cadenza? Who in the hoof is that?! [snort]\nFluttershy: Um, Twilight? Are you okay?\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry, it's just that Shining Armor and I have always been so close.

At a wedding?! Can you say \"best wedding ever\"?!\nPinkie Pie: [gasp] [echoing] Best wedding ever!\nSpike: So you all get to help with the big fancy wedding, but I'm the one who gets to host the bachelor party! I have just one question. What's a bachelor party?\nRainbow Dash,  Rarity,  Pinkie Pie,  Applejack, and  Fluttershy: [laughter]\nApplejack: Why the long face, sugarcube?\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm just thinking about Shining Armor. Ever since I moved to Ponyville, we've been seeing each other less and less. And now that he's starting a new family with this \"Princess Mi Amore Ca-whatshername\", we'll probably never see each other.\nApplejack: Come on, now. You're his sister. He'll always make time for you.\nTwilight Sparkle: Couldn't seem to make time to tell me he was getting married.\n\nPinkie Pie: We're here, we're here!\nRainbow Dash: Whoa, what's with all the guards?\nRarity: I'm sure they're just taking the necessary precautions. Royal weddings do bring out the strangest ponies.\nPinkie Pie: Aaaaaaaaa\u2013 [sneezes like a trumpet]\nRarity: Now, let's get going! We've got work to do!\nApplejack: And you've got a big brother to go congratulate.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah. Congratulate. And then give him a piece of my mind.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I've got something to say to you, mister.\nShining Armor: Twily! Ah, I've missed, you, kid. How was the train ride? I\u2013\nTwilight Sparkle: How dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married! I'm your sister, for pony's sake!\nShining Armor: It's not my fault! Princess Celestia has requested a major increase in security. Didn't you see all the guards at the train station?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah, there's a big wedding coming up. Maybe you heard about it?\nShining Armor: It has nothing to do with the wedding. A threat has been made against Canterlot. We don't know who's responsible for it, but Princess Celestia asked that I help provide additional protection. This, you need to see.\n[pop]\nShining Armor: [gasps] The burden of keeping Canterlot safe and secure rests squarely on my shoulders. Staying focused on the task at hand has been my top priority.\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, okay, I get it. You've got a really important job protecting all of Canterlot with a force field only you can conjure up. But still... how could you not tell me about something as big as your wedding? Am I not that important to you any more?\nShining Armor: Hey. You're my little sister. Of course you're important to me. But I'd understand if you didn't want to be my best mare now.\nTwilight Sparkle: You want me to be your best mare?\nShining Armor: Well... yeah.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'd be honored! But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know! When did you even meet this \"Princess Mi Amore Cadenza\"?\nShining Armor: Twily, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance, your old foalsitter.\nTwilight Sparkle: Cadance? As in the Cadance? As in the greatest foalsitter in all the history of foalsitters?!\nShining Armor: [chuckles] You tell me. She was your foalsitter.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ohmygoshohmygosh! Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever! She's beautiful, she's caring, she's kind...\n\nYoung Twilight Sparkle: I am so lucky to have you as my foalsitter!\nYoung Cadance: I'm the one who's lucky, Twilight.\nYoung Twilight Sparkle: [scoffs] You're a princess. I'm just a regular old unicorn.\nYoung Cadance: You are anything but a regular old unicorn.\nYoung Twilight and Young Cadance: Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake! [laughing]\n\nWild Fire: I am going for a hooficure and that is that!\nLucky Clover: You are not going\u2013\nWild Fire: I am! I am!\nLucky Clover: I've already paid for three this month!\nWild Fire: I... no! My girlfriends are all getting their hooves done! And you said that onl\u2013\nLucky Clover: Please, we've done this at least\u2013\nLucky Clover and Wild Fire: [suddenly stop arguing]\nLucky Clover: Oh! Ho, ho, ho.\nWild Fire: Oh, sweetie. You just did that face.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: How many unicorns can just spread love wherever they go? I only know of one! And you're marrying her! [sing-song voice] You're marrying Cadance! You're marrying Cadance!\nPrincess Cadance: I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.\nTwilight Sparkle: Cadance! Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake!\nPrincess Cadance: What are you doing?\nTwilight Sparkle: Cadance, it's me, Twilight!\nPrincess Cadance: [uninterested] Uh-huh.\nShining Armor: I've gotta get back to my station, but Cadance will be checking in with all of you to see how things are going. I think I speak for both of us when I say we couldn't be more excited to have you here. Right, dear?\nPrincess Cadance: Absolutely.\nShining Armor: Well, we'll let you get to it.\n\n[country music]\nApplejack: Cake, check. Ice sculpture, check. Best darn bite-size apple fritter you ever tasted...\nTwilight Sparkle: Mmm. Check.\nSpike: [deep voice] I do. Do you? [high voice] I do!

You come to check out what's on the menu for your big day?\nPrincess Cadance: I have!\n[sinister chords]\nPrincess Cadance: [gulp] Delicious! I love-love-love them. [laughs nervously]\nApplejack: Aw, shucks. Why don't you take a few to go? [squee] I know how you brides can be. So busy, you forget to get a little somethin' in your belly.\n[thud]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\n[door closes]\nTwilight Sparkle: Did... you see what she...\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, you should have seen how she acted back there. I don't know when she changed, but she changed! [imitating Cadance] \"Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza.\"\nPrincess Cadance: Did I hear someone say my name?\nRarity: Your highness! Let me just start by saying what an honor it is to play a role in such a momentous occasion. [laughs nervously]\nPrincess Cadance: [unenthusiastically] Uh-huh. Is my dress ready?\nRarity: [stammers] Yes, of course. Um, I've been working on it ever since I was given the assignment, and I think you'll be pleased with the results! Mmm!\nPrincess Cadance: I was hoping for something with more beading and a longer train.\nRarity: Oh, yes, of course.\nPrincess Cadance: And those should be a different color.\nTwinkleshine: I think they're lovely.\nMinuette: Me too!\nLyra Heartstrings: I love them.\nPrincess Cadance: Make them a different color.\nTwilight Sparkle: Gee, maybe her name should be \"Princess Demandy-pants.\"\n\n[pop]\nPinkie Pie: Okay, let me see. We've been over the games... [rattles dice] ...the dances...\n[polka from Swarm of the Century plays and stops]\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] I think this reception is gonna be perfect! Don't you?\nPrincess Cadance: Perfect! ...If we were celebrating a six-year-old's birthday party.\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] Thank you!\n\nPrincess Luna: Rest, my sister. As always, I will guard the night.\nTwilight Sparkle: Bet I can guess what you're all thinking. Cadance is the absolute worst bride-to-be ever.\nSpike: [high voice] Who, me?\nApplejack: Spike! That goes on the cake.\nSpike: [laughs nervously]\nRarity: Twilight, whatever are you talking about? Cadance is an absolute gem!\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity, she was so demanding!\nRarity: Well, of course she is! Why shouldn't she expect the very best on her wedding day?\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack, did you know that after she told you how much she just 'love-love-loved' your hors d'eouvres, she threw them in the trash?\nApplejack: Aw, she was probably just trying to spare my feelin's.\nTwilight Sparkle: No, she was just being fake and totally insincere!\nFluttershy: She did raise her voice at one of my birds during rehearsal.\nTwilight Sparkle: See? Rude!\nFluttershy: But he was singing really off-key.\n[bird sings off-key]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, you had to have noticed how Cadance treated\u2013\nPinkie Pie and Spike: [kissing noises and laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Never mind. Rainbow Dash, you're with me, right?\nRainbow Dash: Sorry, Twi. Been too busy prepping for my sonic rainboom to pay much attention to the bride's bad attitude.\nTwilight Sparkle: [growls]\nRarity: The princess is about to get married. I'm sure any negative behavior she might be displaying is simply the result of nerves.\n[thump]\nTwilight Sparkle: And I'm sure it's the result of being an awful pony who doesn't deserve to even know Shining Armor, let alone marry him!\nApplejack: Think maybe you're bein' just a tiny bit possessive of your brother?\nRest of main cast: Uh-huh.\nTwilight Sparkle: I am not being possessive, and I am not taking it out on Cadance! You're all just too caught up in your wedding planning to notice that maybe there shouldn't even [thumps table] be a wedding!\n\n[knocking]\nShining Armor: Twily! Your big brother's looking pretty good, don't you think? Huh. Everything okay?\nTwilight Sparkle: We need to talk. I think you're making a big\u2013\nPrincess Cadance: [clears throat]\nShining Armor: Oh, uh, hi, sweetie.\nTwilight Sparkle: She sure has a way of sneaking up on people.\nPrincess Cadance: Could I speak to you for a moment, dear?\nShining Armor: Better see what she wants.\nPrincess Cadance: [muffled] Look, we need to talk.\nShining Armor: [muffled] I'm here to talk.\nPrincess Cadance: [muffled] It's about your sister, okay?\nShining Armor: [muffled] I\u2013 look, look, she's okay\u2013\nPrincess Cadance: [muffled] Just... listen to me, (over Shining Armor) alright? No no\u2013\nShining Armor: [muffled] I'm listening, I'm listening.\nPrincess Cadance: [muffled] I thought I made it perfectly clear I didn't want you to wear that.\nShining Armor: This was my favorite uncle's.\nPrincess Cadance: And?\nShining Armor: And I think I should wear it.\nPrincess Cadance: Are you disagreeing with me?\nShining Armor: I guess I am\u2013 Ah!\nPrincess Cadance: Oh, dear. Are you getting another one of your headaches?\nShining Armor: Gyah!\nPrincess Cadance: Feeling better?\nShining Armor: [grunts] Mm-hmm.\nTwilight Sparkle: She isn't just unpleasant and rude. She's downright evil!\nShining Armor: Twilight!\nPrincess Cadance: Let her go.\nShining Armor: Huh. It seemed like she had something else she wanted to tell me.\n\nPrincess Luna: Who goes there? Stay indoors, Twilight Sparkle.\nTwilight Sparkle: Shining Armor's in real trouble! You have to help\u2013\nRest of main cast: [various chatter]\nTwilight Sparkle: Dresses? What are you\u2013?\nFluttershy: Can you believe it? We're gonna be Princess Mi Amore Cadenza's new bridesmaids!\nTwilight Sparkle: New bridesmaids? What happened to her old bridesmaids?\nApplejack: She didn't say. But she did tell us that she would love-love-love it if we'd fill in for them.\nRarity: Seeing as we've been working so hard and everything.\nApplejack: And you had your doubts about her.\nRarity: Told you she was an absolute gem!\nRainbow Dash: You sure this is what I should wear? Doesn't seem all that aerodynamic.\nRarity: Hmm. I'll see what I can do.\nApplejack, Pinkie Pie, and Fluttershy: [excited chatter and laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Looks like I really am on my own.\n\n[church organ music]\nPrincess Celestia: Perfect, girls. No need to rush. Then of course, Cadance will enter.\n[Wagner's \"Bridal Chorus\" plays]\nPrincess Celestia: I'll say a few words, and then we'll begin with the vows. Shining Armor, you'll get the ring from your best mare.\nSpike: [deep voice] Do you? [high voice] I do!\nShining Armor: Hey... has anypony seen Twilight?\n[doors open]\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm here! I'm not gonna stand next to her! And neither should you!\nShining Armor: I'm sorry, I... I don't know why she's acting like this.\nPrincess Cadance: Maybe we should just ignore her.\nTwilight Sparkle: You have to listen to me!\nFluttershy: Oh, goodness! Are you okay?\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm fine.\nApplejack: Ya sure about that?\nTwilight Sparkle: I've got something to say! She's evil!\nRest of main cast: [concerned chattering]\nRoyal guard: [inaudible comment to other guard]\nTwilight Sparkle: She's been horrible to my friends, she's obviously done something to her bridesmaids, and if that wasn't enough, I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all [bells jangling]!\nPrincess Cadance: [starts crying] Why are you doing this to me?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Because you're evil!\nPrincess Cadance: [crying]\nTwilight Sparkle: Evil! And if I don't stop you, you're gonna ruin my brother's life!\n[smack]\nShining Armor: You want to know why my eyes went all [bells jangling]? Nuh! Because ever since I started having to perform my protection spell, I've been getting terrible migraines. Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me. She's been using her magic to heal me!\nTwilight Sparkle: [inhales]\nShining Armor: And she decided to replace her bridesmaids because she found out the only reason they wanted to be in the wedding was so that they could meet Canterlot royalty! And if she hasn't been on her best behavior with your [stomps hoof] friends, it's because with me being so busy, she's had to make all the decisions about the wedding!\nTwilight Sparkle: I was just trying to\u2013\nShining Armor: She's been completely stressed out because it's really important to her that our big day be perfect! Something that obviously wasn't important to you! [gasps] Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go and comfort my bride. And you can forget about being my best mare. In fact, if I were you, I wouldn't show up to the wedding at all.\nApplejack: C'mon, y'all.

Ah, I've missed you, kid.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: How dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married!\n\nShining Armor: A threat has been made against Canterlot. Princess Celestia asked that I help provide additional protection.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know.\n\nShining Armor: Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever!\n\nQueen Chrysalis: I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Cadance, it's me! Twilight!\nQueen Chrysalis: [uninterested] Uh-huh.\n\nShining Armor: And I think I should wear it.\nQueen Chrysalis: Are you disagreeing with me?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: She's evil! I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all [bells jangling]!\n\nShining Armor: Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me. She's been using her magic to heal me! If I were you, I wouldn't show up to the wedding at all.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I just lost a brother. I'm sorry!\n\nQueen Chrysalis: You will be.\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [echoing] Hello? Is anyone there?\n[thud]\n[laughter]\nTwilight Sparkle: Where am I?\nQueen Chrysalis: The caves beneath Canterlot, once home to greedy unicorns who wanted to claim the gems that could be found inside. And now, your prison.\nTwilight Sparkle: Help! Help!\nQueen Chrysalis: [laughing] It's no use. No one can hear you. And no one will ever think to look for you, either. Most ponies have forgotten that these caves even exist, which is why they are the ideal place to keep the ones who try to interfere with my plans. [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Plans? What plans?\nQueen Chrysalis: The plans I have for your brother, of course.\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't you dare do anything to my brother, you... you monster!\nQueen Chrysalis: Only way to stop me is to catch me! [laughing] Over here! [laughing] Nope, over here! [laughing]\n[glass breaking]\nPrincess Cadance: No! Wait! Ugh! Please! Don't hurt me! Twilight, it's me! Please, you have to believe me. I've been imprisoned like you. The Cadance who brought you down here was an imposter.\nTwilight Sparkle: Likely story!\nPrincess Cadance: Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake. Clap your hooves...\nTwilight Sparkle and Princess Cadance: ...and do a little shake.\nTwilight Sparkle: You remember me!\nPrincess Cadance: Of course I do.

But you're still too late.\nApplejack: I-I don't understand. How can there be two of 'em?\nPrincess Cadance: She's a changeling. She takes the form of somepony you love and gains power by feeding off your love for them.\n[flames roaring]\n[ponies gasp]\nQueen Chrysalis: [laughing] Right you are, Princess. And as queen of the changelings, it is up to me to find food for my subjects. Equestria has more love than any place I've ever encountered. My fellow changelings will be able to devour so much of it that we will gain more power than we have ever dreamed of!\nPrincess Cadance: They'll never get the chance! Shining Armor's protection spell will keep them from ever even reaching us!\nQueen Chrysalis: [chuckling] Oh, I doubt that. Isn't that right, dear?\nShining Armor: Mm-hmm.\nQueen Chrysalis: Ah, ah, ah. Don't want to go back to the caves, now do you? Ever since I took your place, I've been feeding off Shining Armor's love for you. Every moment he grows weaker and so does his spell. Even now, my minions are chipping away at it.\nChangelings: [laughing]\nQueen Chrysalis: [laughing] He may not be my husband, but he is under my total control now.\nTwilight Sparkle and Princess Cadance: [gasp]\nQueen Chrysalis: And, I'm sorry to say, unable to perform his duties as captain of the Royal Guard.\nPrincess Cadance: Not my Shining Armor!\nQueen Chrysalis: Soon, my changeling army will break through. First, we take Canterlot. And then, all of Equestria!\nPrincess Celestia: No. You won't. You may have made it impossible for Shining Armor to perform his spell, but now that you have so foolishly revealed your true self, I can protect my subjects from you!\nQueen Chrysalis: [grunting]\n[explosion]\n[crown clatters]\n[ponies gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Celestia!\nQueen Chrysalis: Ah! Shining Armor's love for you is even stronger than I thought! Consuming it has made me even more powerful than Celestia!\nPrincess Celestia: The Elements of Harmony.

How did you...?\nTwilight Sparkle: They're changelings, remember?\nChangelings [as Twilight Sparkle]: They're changelings, remember?\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't let them distract you. We have to get to the Elements of Harmony. They're our only hope.\n[various fighting sounds]\nChangelings [as Rainbow Dash]: [growls]\nChangeling: [hisses]\nApplejack: Okay, this is just gettin' weird. Real me!

Feed!\n[doors close]\nQueen Chrysalis: [laughing] It's funny, really. Twilight here was suspicious of my behavior all along. Too bad the rest of you were too caught up in your wedding planning to realize those suspicions were correct! [laughing]\nApplejack: Sorry, Twi. We should've listened to you.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's not your fault. She fooled everypony.\nQueen Chrysalis: Hmm, I did, didn't I?\n\nThis day has been just perfect\nThe kind of day of which I've dreamed since I was small\nEverypony I'll soon control\nEvery stallion, mare, and foal\nWho says a girl can't really have it all?

Is...is the wedding over?\nQueen Chrysalis: It's all over!\nTwilight Sparkle: Your spell! Perform your spell!\nQueen Chrysalis: [laughing] What good would that do? My changelings already roam free.\nShining Armor: No! My power is useless now.

I get why the queen of the changelings wanted to be with you, but how did you get someone as amazing as Cadance to marry you?\nShining Armor: I told her she wouldn't just be gaining a husband. She'd be getting a pretty great sister, too.\nPrincess Celestia: Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of the real Princess Mi Amore Cadenza\u2013\nPrincess Cadance: Princess Cadance is fine.\nPrincess Celestia: Hm. The union of Princess Cadance and Shining Armor. The strength of their commitment is clear. The power of their love, undeniable. May we have the rings please? I now pronounce you mare and colt!\n[cheering]\nPrincess Celestia: This is your victory as much as theirs. You persisted in the face of doubt, and your actions led to your being able to bring the real Princess Cadance back to us.

I don't think there's anything in any of my books th\u2013\nPrincess Celestia: There wouldn't be. Few remember it ever existed at all. Even my knowledge of the Empire is limited. But what I do know is that it contains a powerful magic. One thousand years ago, King Sombra, a unicorn whose heart was black as night, took over the Crystal Empire.\nKing Sombra: [growls]\n[chains jangling]\nPrincess Celestia: He was ultimately overthrown, turned to shadow, and banished to the ice of the arctic north.\nKing Sombra: [roars]\nPrincess Celestia: But not before he was able to put a curse upon the Empire. A curse that caused it to vanish into thin air. If the Empire is filled with hope and love, those things are reflected across all of Equestria. If hatred and fear take hold... Which is why I need your help finding a way to protect it.\nTwilight Sparkle: You want me to help protect an entire empire?\nPrincess Celestia: It is, as I said, a different kind of test.

Hahaha, there are Crystal Ponies?! Um, ahem. Please continue.\nShining Armor: But we have to believe one of them knows how we can protect the Empire without having to use Cadance's magic.\nTwilight Sparkle: A research paper!\nShining Armor: Huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: That must be part of my test \u2013 to gather information from the Crystal Ponies and deliver it to you!

You really do.\nApplejack: We're lookin' for a history book. Somethin' that might tell us how the Empire might've protected itself from danger back in the day.\nAmethyst Maresbury: Yes. Of course. History, history... Ah, yes.\nMane Six: [squee]\n[pause]\nTwilight Sparkle: Which is where, exactly?\nAmethyst Maresbury: I... I can't seem to remember. I'm not sure I actually work here.\nRainbow Dash: Ugh.\nTwilight Sparkle: We'll just take a look around. I'm sure we can find it on our own.\nAmethyst Maresbury: Let me know if you find anything.\nPinkie Pie: I like her!\n\nApplejack: Uh, anyone else startin' to think this is a lost cause?\nTwilight Sparkle: No, no, no, no, no... Yes! \"History of the Crystal Empire\". I just hope it has the answers we need.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: A 'Crystal Faire'. According to this book, it was established by their first queen and became their most important tradition. The Faire was held every year to \"renew the spirit of love and unity in the empire so they could protect it from harm\". My friends and I could put it together.

One last check to make sure everything is in place, and then the festivities can begin!\nApplejack: What's this thing for?\n[thunk]\nTwilight Sparkle: The last page of the book mentioned a Crystal Heart as the faire's centerpiece, so I used my magic to cut one out of a crystal block.\nApplejack: Nice work, Twi.

Crystal Heart?\nCrystal Ponies: [chattering]\nRainbow Dash: We totally nailed it, right? Must be feeling a lot of love and unity about now! Gonna have some grub, huh? What are you thinking? Crystal Empire berry pie? Maybe some crystal corn-on-the-cob!\n[clang]\nRainbow Dash: What is with these ponies?!\nAutumn Gem: Seeing all of this, I feel like I'm starting to remember.

Can't have a Crystal Faire without the Crystal Heart, right?\nAmethyst Maresbury: Of course you can't. The whole purpose of the Crystal Faire is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies, so the light within them can power the Crystal Heart, so that the Empire can be protected! [gasps] I do work at the library!\nRainbow Dash: W-what's that about 'powering the heart'?\nAmethyst Maresbury: I just can't believe you found it. King Sombra said he'd hidden it away where we would never see it again! I only hope it will still be as powerful after all these years...! Mm, funnel cake!\nRainbow Dash: [strangled sound]\nTwilight Sparkle: Why did you\u2013\nRainbow Dash: I think we may have a problem...\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I didn't know it was an actual relic! The book didn't mention anything about the Crystal Ponies powering the Heart! There was a page missing...

Retrieving the Crystal Heart must be it. But there is something else you can do.\nRainbow Dash: Name it.\nTwilight Sparkle: You and the rest of our friends have to keep the Faire going.\nRainbow Dash: What? With that thing moving into the Empire?\nTwilight Sparkle: The whole purpose of the Crystal Faire is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies, so they can activate the Crystal Heart.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, and?\nTwilight Sparkle: If the Crystal Ponies find out that King Sombra is trying to take over the Empire again, their spirits are gonna be anything but lifted. It won't matter if I find the Crystal Heart. They won't be able to make it work. You have to keep them happy here at the Faire.\nRainbow Dash: Keep the Faire going and the Crystal Ponies' spirits high.

They'd have been too afraid to even try.\nSpike: I hope you're right.\nTwilight Sparkle: You and me both.\nApplejack: [whinnies]\nRainbow Dash: What are you lookin' at?! That's what I thought!\nApplejack: [whispering] Uh, Rainbow Dash? We're supposed to be actin' like nothing's wrong.\nRainbow Dash: Exactly. [growls]\nApplejack: [hushed] What I mean is, maybe you should let me keep the Crystal Ponies away from the fake Heart, while you show off your joustin' skills.\nRainbow Dash: Huh. Seeing my awesomeness does have a way of putting ponies into a pretty good mood.\n\n[ewes bleating]\nRainbow Dash: Come on, Knight Fluttershy.\nFluttershy: Huh?\nRainbow Dash: It's showtime.\n\nApplejack: How are y'all feelin'? Havin' a good time?\nAutumn Gem: The best I've had in over a thousand years!\nApplejack: Well, that's good! Gotta renew that spirit of love and unity if you're gonna power up that Crystal Heart, right?\nAutumn Gem: I sure would like to see it before the ceremony. It's been such a long time.\nApplejack: Oh, I hear ya, but, uh... phew! Gettin' a little toasty out here. Bet you'd like to cool off with a little Crystal Empire nectar! Uh, you tried the Crystal Empire fritters yet? Made from a traditional Crystal Empire recipe! You're gonna love 'em! [loudly] Uh, I hear there's a joustin' match about to start!

If hatred and fear take hold... [echoes out]\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course!\nSpike: [panting for breath] Argh! What? Did you find it?\nTwilight Sparkle: No. Because this isn't King Sombra's castle.\nSpike: Well, isn't this where he lived when he was in power?\nTwilight Sparkle: It is. But it didn't look like this.

I was calling your name, but I couldn't seem to get your attention, and\u2013 What were you looking at? I mean... it's just a wall. ...Ponyville?! Well, how did I get... No! I don't wanna go! Please, Twilight, don't make me!\n[door slams]\nTwilight Sparkle: King Sombra's dark magic. A doorway that leads to your worst fear.\nSpike: We were home. You told me you didn't need me anymore.

And I'm not gonna fail my test!\n[door opens]\nSpike: What's in there?\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Stairs. Lots and lots of stairs.

If you don't, you'll fail Celestia's test!\nTwilight Sparkle: King Sombra is already attacking the Empire.

Gotta stay strong... for Twilight...\n\nPrincess Celestia: It's beautiful.\nTwilight Sparkle: I wish it had been me who ultimately made it so. But it wasn't.\nPrincess Celestia: Twilight, as I understand it, Spike brought Princess Cadance the Crystal Heart because you weren't sure how quickly you could find a way to escape the tower. You weren't willing to risk the future of the citizens of the Crystal Empire in an effort to guarantee your own. Far better that I have a student who understands the meaning of self-sacrifice than one who only looks out for her own best interests.\nTwilight Sparkle: Does this mean...?\n\nSpike: She's totally gonna lose it!

I'm here for the same reason.\nPinkie Pie: This is perfect! Everyone will now bring their fun to me. Ha, this'll solve everything!

Trot on over back to Ponyville with me and I'll tell you all about 'em.\n\nPinkie Pie: ...And then there's Rarity. She's the one with all the fancy clothes and ribbons and stuff!

Was it something I said?\n[bear grunts]\nPinkie Pie 2: Yes!\nFluttershy: Huh?\n\nPinkie Pie: So you see, that's how I'm able to have fun in two places at once.\nRainbow Dash: Duplicates of you, huh? Heh, yeah, sure, Pinkie. [yawns] Look, I was just gearing up to catch some Z's, so, uh...\nPinkie Pie: Gotcha. I'll have the rest of my fun really quietly. [quietly] Wheeeee...\nRainbow Dash: How'd you do that?\nPinkie Pie: Just trying to show a little consideration for my sleepy friend. Ooh, ooh, gotta run. Looks like I'm trying to get my attention. Excuse me.\nPinkie Pie 2: And me.\n\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, ooh, tell me all about it! Did they pull the walls of the barn up slow or fast?\nPinkie Pie 2: I\u2013\nPinkie Pie: Maybe slow to medium fast, somewhere in that range?\nPinkie Pie 2: I\u2013\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, did you get ice cream? What kinds did they have? Banana brickle?\nPinkie Pie 2: I didn't make it! I was on my way there and then Fluttershutter\u2013\nPinkie Pie: Fluttershy.\nPinkie Pie 2: Yeah, her. She offered something else fun for me to do! A picnic, with cute little animals!\nPinkie Pie: Aw, how could you say no to that?\nPinkie Pie 2: That's what I'm saying! Then I would've missed the super fun thing with Applesauce!\nPinkie Pie: Applejack.\nPinkie Pie 2: [bawling] So I didn't do anything fun at all!\nPinkie Pie: Aw, my poor poor me! There, there. Tell me what, we just need a couple more Pinkie Pies. Easy peasy.\nPinkie Pie 2: Really?\nPinkie Pie: Come on, would I lie to me?\n\nPinkie Pie and Pinkie Pie 2: \"...and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!\"\nPinkie Pie 2: Look, a double me!\nPinkie Pie: I think you mean a double-double me. Plus another double-double me, which makes two double-double mes, or a double-double-double me, if you will.\nPinkie Pie 2: [happy squeal]\nPinkie Pie 3: Did somebody say fun? Where? Fun fun fun fun fun!\nPinkie Pies 2, 3 and 4: [\"Fun! Fun! Fun!\", laughter]\nPinkie Pie: Now Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy are covered, plus one extra Pinkie Pie in case we get an extra invite from somepony else. Perfect! Okay, let's go! [under] Hey, Pinkies! Yoo-hoo!\nPinkie Pies 2, 3 and 4: \"...and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!\"\nPinkie Pie: Okay, good enough. Pinkie Pies, move it out\u2013\nPinkie Pie Duplicates: \"...not to be scared, at the prospect of being doubly mared!\"\nPinkie Pie: What in the name of pink?! Knock it off!\nPinkie Pie Duplicates: [\"Fun! Fun! Fun!\"]\nPinkie Pie: To Ponyville, everyone! Follow me!\n[pause]\nPinkie Pie: [sighs] Yes, it's fun there.\nPinkie Pie Duplicates: [\"Fun! Fun! Fun!\"]\n\nPinkie Pie Duplicates: [\"Fun! Fun! Fun!\", \"Whee!\"]\nPinkie Pie: [whistles] Okay, between the bunch of us, we should have every nook and cranny of fun in Ponyville covered at all times. An unprecedented and massive undertaking! But first, a pop quiz on the names I taught you!\nPinkie Pie Duplicates: [in chorus] Applejack! Fluttershy! Pinkie Pie!\nPinkie Pie: Excellent. Okay, let's get on with this, folks. Fan out on three. One\u2013\n[whoosh]\nPinkie Pie: Eh, good enough. La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, whee!\n\nPinkie Pie Duplicate: [giggling]\nRainbow Dash: [sneezes] What the\u2013\nPinkie Pie Duplicates: [shouting \"Fun!\", etc.]\nRainbow Dash: Wow! Pinkie Pie wasn't kidding about the duplicates! Except now there's triplicates... and quadruplicates!\nPinkie Pie: Dash is gonna love this! Aw, if I push her around on this floaty thing, it'll be fun and relaxing!\n[duplicates shouting in distance]\nPinkie Pie: Uh-oh...\nRainbow Dash: No more Pinkies! I can't take it!\n[drum banging]\nPinkie Pie: Gosh, uh... I wonder what fun they're having raising the barn at Applejack's right now! Maybe I'd better go check!\n\nApplejack, Big McIntosh, Apple Fritter, and Meadow Song: [sounds of exertion]\n[Pinkie duplicates shouting \"Fun!\"]\nPinkie Pie Duplicate: [laughs]\nApplejack: No!\n[crash]\nPinkie Pie: Oh, phew! Looks like I haven't missed a thing!\nApplejack: I wanna know right now where all you Pinkies came from, so I can find out who's responsible for y'all ruinin' our barn raisin'!\n[crash]\nPinkie Pie: Uh, you look pretty busy right now, so [laughs nervously] maybe we should talk a little later?\nPinkie Pie Duplicates: Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun!\nApplejack: Y'all come back here and clean up after yourselves this instant!\n[duplicates shouting]\nPinkie Pie: Oh no, what have I done, what have I done?! My poor friends...\n\n[ponies shouting angrily]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, everypony, please, calm down!\nRarity: Calm down? I just had a Pinkie hurricane raging through my shop!\nFluttershy: And they trashed our critter picnic!\n[ponies shouting angrily]\nTwilight Sparkle: Please, everypony, hang on while I try to figure something out! Come on, Spike. I've gotta try to remember the name of that legend she mentioned.\n[wood creaking]\n[thud]\nTwilight Sparkle: Aha, here it is! \"The legend of the Mirror Pond\"... It describes a spell I can use to send them back where they came from!\nSpike: That's perfect! Let's go!\nTwilight Sparkle: But there's a catch. If I can't figure out which one's the real Pinkie, I might send her back by mistake!\nSpike: Well, we'll just have to figure out who the real one is then. Shouldn't be too hard.\nTwilight Sparkle: Does anypony here know how we can tell the real Pinkie Pie from all the rest of them?\nPonies: [\"Uh...\", \"I don't know\", etc.]\nPinkie Pie: Twilight! I have to talk to you, I need your help!\nTwilight Sparkle: Excuse me, whoever you are, but I'm not talking to any of you Pinkies unless you're the real Pinkie.\nPinkie Pie: Oh, but, but I am the real Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie Duplicate: No, you're not! I'm the real Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie Duplicate 2: I'm the real Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie Duplicate 3: No, I'm the real Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie Duplicate 4: I'm the real Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie Duplicate 5: No, I'm the real Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie Duplicate 6: I'm the real Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie Duplicates: [\"Fun! Fun! Fun!\"]\nApplejack: How in tarnation are we supposed to tell which is the real Pinkie?\nTwilight Sparkle: I have no idea.\nPinkie Pie: Me either. Ohh... We've all got the same adorable tails, we've all got the same adorable manes, we've all got the same adorable hooves! Which one of us is the real Pinkie?! Oh! I haven't the slightest clue! And if I can't tell us apart... who can? [crying]\nPinkie Pie Duplicates: [\"Fun! Fun! Fun!\"]\n\n[duplicates shouting]\n[windows slamming]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh, this is hopeless!\nSpike: Maybe that one's the real Pinkie.\nTwilight Sparkle: Please. The real Pinkie Pie never sat that long in one place her whole life!\nSpike: I'm gonna go ask.\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course she's gonna say she's the real Pinkie! They all do! You're wasting your time.\nSpike: So lemme guess. You're the real Pinkie Pie.\nPinkie Pie: Heck if I know. Could be any one of us if you ask me. And if I said I was the real Pinkie, you wouldn't even believe me anyway. So just leave me alone. I've got some important poking the ground with my hoof to do.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Spike, how're we gonna do this? I can't risk sending the real Pinkie back into the pond!\nSpike: I miss the real Pinkie.\nPinkie Pie: [sighs] I bet she misses you too. Bet she'd do just about anything to get to be with her friends again. Hey. Hey! What if you gave them a test? Pick something really hard for a Pinkie to do, something not fun at all! Any Pinkie that can't do it goes back into the pond. But whoever wants to stay the most, that must be the real Pinkie!\nTwilight Sparkle: You know, that's not a bad idea.\nPinkie Pie: This is great! If I pass, I get to be with my friends again! [gasps] But what if I don't pass? Oh, what if I'm not the real Pinkie Pie?! Ohhhh! Stupid [thud] magic [thud] mirror [thud] water! This is all your fault! ...And mine. [thud]\n\nRainbow Dash: Hey, Twilight!\nTwilight Sparkle: I've been looking all over for you ponies. What are you all doing here?\nRainbow Dash: Fluttershy spoke with the woodland critters, and they've agreed to take us into their home 'til the Pinkie storm dies down.\nTwilight Sparkle: You guys, we're gonna fix this. And I know exactly how.\nFluttershy: Are we gonna lose our real Pinkie Pie?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't think so. Now come along. I've already got Applejack and her family rounding up all the Pinkies.\n\n[rumbling]\n[duplicates shouting]\nApplejack: Hyah, ya Pinkies! Hyah!\nPinkie Pie Duplicate: Ooh, they wanna play chase! This is fun, too!\n[duplicates shouting, continues under]\nApplejack: Oh, give it a rest.\nTwilight Sparkle: Welcome, Pinkies, welcome. Please have a seat and make yourselves comfortable. [pause] Okay, I suppose you can't be comfortable staying in one place, but have a seat anyway. [pause] Sit down!\n[duplicates stop shouting]\nTwilight Sparkle: Better. Now, I suppose you're all wondering why I've gathered you all here today.\nPinkie Pie Duplicate: For fun?\nTwilight Sparkle: No, just the opposite actually.\nRainbow Dash: Wait up, I got one more! Found this one poking at the ground with her hoof, drawing frowny faces.\nTwilight Sparkle: Have her come sit with the others.\n[thud]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkies, you've been brought here to take a test.\nPinkie Pie Duplicates: [in chorus] Awww!\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't worry, it's a simple test, about as simple as they come, and whoever passes gets to stay.\n[duplicates making huh noises, yeah]\nTwilight Sparkle: Curtain, please. The test... will be watching paint dry!\n[duplicates gasping]\nTwilight Sparkle: On your mark, get set, go!\nSpike: Ooh, this is so exciting!\n\nSpike: Okay, maybe not that exciting.\n[bird chirping]\nPinkie Pie Duplicate: Oh, hey, look at the birdie!\nTwilight Sparkle: [grunts]\n[poof]\nPinkie Pie Duplicate: Watch me bounce and touch the ceiling!\n[poof]\n[frog croaking]\nPinkie Pie Duplicate: Is that... is that a frog crossed with an orange?\nPinkie Pie Duplicate 2: Cool!\nPinkie Pie Duplicate 3: Where?\n[poof]\nPinkie Pie Duplicate: Look what I can do with my hooves! [blows]\n[popping noises]\n[poof]\nPinkie Pie Duplicate: Betcha can't make a face crazier than... this!\n[poof]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sounds of exertion] [blows]\n[long pause]\nRainbow Dash: Ugh, I can't take it anymore! Somepony's making balloon animals!\nPinkie Pie Duplicate: What? Where?\n[poof]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie, you can look away now.\nPinkie Pie: I passed?\nTwilight Sparkle: You passed. You're the only Pinkie who kept staring at the wall.\nPinkie Pie: I had to. I just had to. I couldn't leave my friends, I just couldn't. But I guess sometimes I will have to choose between them.\nTwilight Sparkle: I knew you'd be up to the challenge.\nPinkie Pie: I'm me! I'm me! I'm me! Or am I? Yeah, I'm pretty sure I am.\n\nPinkie Pie: Dear Princess Celestia,\nIt's great to have fun, but it's even greater to have great friends. And having lots of friends means that you sometimes have to make choices as to who you'll spend your time with. But that's okay, because good friends will always give you lots of opportunities to have fun. So even if you're missing out, it's never for long.\nRespectfully yours,\nPinkie Pie.\nSpike: [blows fire]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hi, Pinkie Pie. We were thinking we should go out and celebrate.\nApplejack: You up for some wheelbarrow races?\nRainbow Dash: Or I could take everypony on a cloud ride!\nRarity: I could throw a party with punch and zesty cucumber sandwiches! Ooh!\nPinkie Pie: You wanna know exactly what I feel like doing right now? [sighs] [snores]\nFluttershy: That looks like fun.\n[all laughing]\nApplejack: Oh, Pinkie.\n[door closes]\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nApple Bloom: [whining] What to wear, what to wear?

It's one of Zecora's doorstops.\n[rock shattering]\nTrixie: [upset] But... how did you do those spells? Nopony can do those spells!\nTwilight Sparkle: You're right. Not even me. Zecora taught me so much about magic while I was in exile. She even taught me when not to use it. My magic alone wasn't powerful enough to take on the Alicorn Amulet head to head, so I needed to use a different kind of magic \u2013 the magic of friendship.

Totally gonna be worth it when we get to Winsome Falls.\n[eerie noises]\nScootaloo: Yeah... Totally... [twitches]\n\nRarity: Ohh... Am I sweating? Oh! I think I'm sweating! Oh, uh, but it's absolutely worth it to get to spend time with my little sister. It's just that this cart feels like it's getting heavier all the time!\nApplejack: I don't care if that cart's as heavy as a pack of mules. If we don't get a move on, it'll be dark before we get to the campsite!\nScootaloo: [gasps] Dark?! [wings buzzing] I'll just ride ahead and make sure the path is clear. We don't wanna be out here after dark, right?\nRainbow Dash: Doesn't matter to me.\nScootaloo: Well, y'know, [hushed] it's for the scaredy-ponies, heheh.\n\nScootaloo: [yawns]\n[thump]\nScootaloo: [gasps] Don't fall asleep now... We've got to get to that campsite before dark... [snores, continues over]\n[bonk]\nCrocodile: [growls]\nBear: [licks lips] [chomps] [grunts]\nRarity: [fades in] That's why it's always important to bring your own trunk on any public outing.\nScootaloo: [gasps] Um... don't come this way! Take the path! It's, heh, way better than going through the bushes.\n\n[twig snaps]\nScootaloo: [yelps]\n[poof]\n[crunch]\nApplejack: You're more nervous than a worm in an apple on cider making day. What gives, Scootaloo?\nScootaloo: Heh, nothing, just thought I heard something, aheh.\n[owl hoots]\nScootaloo: [yelps]\nApplejack: You sure you're okay? You seem a little jumpy.\nScootaloo: Just getting my exercise! You know how important it is to stretch out those hindquarters every so often, aheh.\n[frog croaking]\n[bells ringing]\nScootaloo: Uh, d-do you need a little help?\nRarity: That's so sweet, thank you.\nScootaloo: Um... what are friends for? [sounds of exertion]\n\n[cart creaking]\nApplejack: No need for tents tonight, y'all. We'll just take shelter in that cave.\nRainbow Dash: All right! A deep, dark cave! Perfect for the story I've got for tonight. All we need is a campfire, and we're good to go.\nScootaloo: [gulps] [nervously] Uh, of course...\n[wolf howling]\nScootaloo: [nervously] I'll be right back with lots of firewood from the deep... dark... not-scary-at-all forest!\nRainbow Dash: Thanks.\n[creatures growling]\nScootaloo: [breathing heavily] [sighs] Okay. I can do this. On the count of three, I get those branches. One... two... three! [trembling] [sighs] [nervously] Here, branches branches branches...\nApplejack: Bbbbrrr! Hoo-wee! It's colder than a timberwolf's toenail. Bbbrr! Where's that Scootaloo?\nScootaloo: [panicked laughing] Here you go!\nRainbow Dash: That's it?\nScootaloo: It's all I could find, 'cause, y'know, there aren't that many trees around here!\nApplejack: It's all we need. Why don't you sit with Rainbow Dash for a while?\n[fire starts]\nRainbow Dash: Now, where was I? Oh yeah, the [spookily] scary part. [laughs evilly]\nScootaloo: Hey, I have an idea! How about I tell tonight's story?\nRainbow Dash: Alright, just make sure it's a horrible one.\nScootaloo: There once was a really really nice pony who lived in a bright and sunny land, where there are rainbows every day, and lots and lots of happy friends, and\u2013\nRainbow Dash: No offense, but it's not a real campfire story unless somepony's shaking. [spookily] I've been told that these very woods are haunted...\nScootaloo: [gulps]\nRainbow Dash: [spookily] ...by The Headless Horse! It gallops only at night\u2013\nApplejack: If it doesn't have a head, then how in tarnation does this pony know where it's goin'?\nRainbow Dash: It's headless, not brainless. [spookily] ...looking for little lost ponies\u2013\nApplejack: So where's its brain?\nRainbow Dash: Ugh. [spookily] Fear was dripping from the air...\n\nRainbow Dash: [spookily] ...and they were never heard from ever again!\nSweetie Belle: [gasps] Never?\nRainbow Dash: Never.\n[fire sparks]\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: [screaming] [laughing]\nScootaloo: [trembling]\nRarity: Don't worry, you'll be safe with me tonight.\nScootaloo: It's not time for bed yet, is it?\nApplejack: 'Fraid so, Scootaloo.\nScootaloo: Uh, but we haven't even sung any campfire songs yet! [squeak]\nSweetie Belle: You don't have to ask me twice!\n[thud]\nSweetie Belle: [singing] Ninety-nine buckets of oats on the wall, ninety-nine buckets of oats! Take one down [...] pass it around, you got eighty-one buckets of oats on the wall [...] forty-one buckets of oats! Take one down, pass it around you got forty... buckets of oats on the wall! [...] buckets of oats! Take one down, pass it around, you've got zero buckets of oats on the waaaaaaaalllllll!!!! [snores]\nOther ponies: [yawning]\nRarity: Good night, Sweetie Belle.\nApplejack: Good night, y'all.\nApple Bloom: Good night, y'all.\nRainbow Dash: Sleep tight.\nScootaloo: Oh, just one more song! Anyone? How about a dance contest? I know you love to cut a rug, so how 'bout we mess up a cave floor? I have a brilliant idea! Hide and seek! Who's with me?\nApple Bloom: [yawns] Maybe tomorrow.\nScootaloo: Aww.\nApplejack: Seems like you don't really wanna go to sleep tonight. Is there some reason why?\nScootaloo: Pfft, of course not! I just love camping and hanging out with Rainbow Dash so much that I don't wanna waste a single minute with sleep! [yawns] Heh, silly sleep.\nRainbow Dash: That's cool and all, Scoot, but this pony needs her shut-eye and she needs it now!\nScootaloo: Ugh, this is so unfair... [yawns] I'm falling asleep... [snores]\n[water dripping]\n\n[hoofsteps]\n[vehicle accelerating]\nScootaloo: [gasps] If The Headless Horse catches me, I'm never gonna be heard from again! And I wanna be heard from! Woah, woaaah!

[cries hysterically]\n\nScootaloo: [panting] Aaah!\nPrincess Luna: [echoing] A warm welcome to you, Scootaloo.\n[poof]\nScootaloo: Princess Luna! I thought you were The Headless Horse!\nPrincess Luna: You were mistaken, but I hope not disappointed.\nScootaloo: You are so, so much better than The Headless Horse. But what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in Canterlot?\nPrincess Luna: I am the princess of the night. Thus it is my duty to come into your dreams.\nScootaloo: Oh, yeah... Wait, is this just a dream? But it feels so real!\n[reverberating drumbeat]\nPrincess Luna: I assure you that you are asleep. But when you awake, the thing that frightens you most will still exist.\nScootaloo: [nervously] Eh... The Headless Horse?\nPrincess Luna: Hmmm... Is The Headless Horse really what frightens you the most?\nScootaloo: Mm-mm. I'm afraid Rainbow Dash will find out I'm not as tough as she thinks I am.\nPrincess Luna: Everypony has fears, Scootaloo. Everypony must face them in their own way. But they must be faced, or the nightmares will continue.\nScootaloo: [nervous whine]\n[rocks tumbling]\nPrincess Luna: Face your fears!\n\nScootaloo: \u2013Princess Luna?! [sighs] It was just a dream.\n[water dripping]\nScootaloo: [gasps] But The Headless Horse isn't! Rainbow Dash said it lives here, in these very woods!\n[distant whinnying]\nScootaloo: It's the wicked whinny of The Headless Horse! [wings motoring]\nRainbow Dash: [whinny-like snoring]\n\nScootaloo: [panting] So it's a horse without a head... which means it doesn't have a mouth... and if it doesn't have a mouth, then... it's not a horse-eat-pony kind of horse... but still... it's a horse without a head!\n[tires screeching]\nScootaloo: Whoa, whoa! [whining]\n[river rushing]\n[splash]\nScootaloo: Hello?! Is anyone out there? [nervously] Anyone except The Headless Horse?\n[branch cracking]\nScootaloo: Heellllp\u2013\n[splash]\nScootaloo: [gasps for breath]\n[splashing]\nScootaloo: [screams, fades out]\n[whoosh]\nRainbow Dash: I gotcha!\nScootaloo: Rainbow Dash! Is that you? Thank you, thank you!\nRainbow Dash: What were you doing out here in the middle of the night?!\nPrincess Luna: [echoing] It is time for you to face your real fear, Scootaloo!\nScootaloo: [sighs] I'm so, so sorry, Rainbow Dash! I just wanted you to hang out with me and see how cool I was so you'd take me under your wing, teach me everything you know, and become like my big sister! [takes breath] But then you started telling those spooky stories and I got scared! I thought I heard The Headless Horse so I ran out here by myself, and... [crying] ...well, I guess you know the rest. [sniffling]\nRainbow Dash: Hey, I'm gonna tell you something, but if you ever tell anypony else, I'm gonna deny it. First time I heard those stories... I was scared too.\nScootaloo: [sniffles] You were?\nRainbow Dash: Sure! I mean, I got over it because I realized pretty quick that if there was such thing as a Headless Horse, I could totally take it on. So, you're looking for somepony to take you under their wing, huh?\nScootaloo: Mm-hmm.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, I might be up for something like that.\nScootaloo: Really?\nRainbow Dash: As long as you don't go falling into any more rivers in the middle of the night.\nScootaloo: [giggles] It's a deal!\n\n[waterfalls rushing]\nSweetie Belle: I call sister teams! Last pair to make it to the falls is a moldy carrot!\nRarity: Ugh, if you insist. [giggles] It is so on!\nRainbow Dash: They think they can beat the two of us?\nScootaloo: [wings fluttering]\n\nThe Olden Pony: [grumbling] Who's got my rusty horseshoe?\nRainbow Dash: Here it is, for pony's sake.

When I get into the Wonderbolt Academy...\nPinkie Pie: IF you get in! If you get in! Don't jinx it!\nRainbow Dash: I'm telling you, it's in the bag.\nPinkie Pie: Don't jinx it!\nApplejack: She is the best flyer in Ponyville.\nRainbow Dash: In Ponyville? I'm probably the best flyer in all of Equestria. I wouldn't be surprised if they just went ahead and made me a Wonderbolt on the first day.\nMessenger Pony: Got a letter here for Rainbow Dash.\nRainbow Dash: I... didn't get in.\nPinkie Pie: [gasp]\nRainbow Dash: Gotcha! Ha, you guys are so gullible. Like I wasn't gonna get in!\nPinkie Pie: I'm just sooooooooooo happy for you!\nRainbow Dash: Uh... thanks?\nPinkie Pie: [squeals]\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie Pie?

Bet y'all think you're Wonderbolt material, don't ya?\nAll Pegasi: Yes, ma'am!\nSpitfire: Think you got what it takes to be an elite flyer?\nAll Pegasi: Yes, ma'am!\nSpitfire: Well then. Let me be the first to tell you... You don't! If you had what it took to be an elite flyer, you'd already be a Wonderbolt! Still think you're something special?\nCloudchaser: No, ma'am!\nSpitfire: [to Bulk Biceps] Ya think you're hot stuff? [to Rainbow Dash] You look like you're the worst flyer in the whole academy! You'll probably quit after the first day!\nRainbow Dash: No, ma'am! I'd never quit, ma'am!\nSpitfire: Ha. What about you? Bet you couldn't fly past the first flagpole without getting winded.\nLightning Dust: Try me, ma'am.\nSpitfire: What's that?\nLightning Dust: Let me show you what I've got, ma'am.\nSpitfire: Ah. You want a chance to prove yourself, huh?\nLightning Dust: Yes, ma'am!\nSpitfire: Well then, now's your chance. Give me five hundred laps! All of you!\n[Pegasi moan]\nSpitfire: Now!

If I'm not here when Rainbow Dash's letter arrives, I won't be able to read it right away. And if I don't read it right away, I won't be able to write her back right away. And if I don't write her back right away, she might think I didn't get her letter, and then she might worry it got lost. And if she's worrying about her letter, she'll be distracted. And if she's distracted, then she won't do well at the academy! And if she doesn't do well at the academy, then she'll get kicked out! And if she gets kicked out, they'll never let her be a Wonderbolt! And if she doesn't get to be a Wonderbolt, all her dreams will be crushed! And it will be all... my... fault! [thud]\nApplejack: So in other words, you're stickin' by the mailbox.\nPinkie Pie: Yep!\nApplejack: Suit yourself.\n[mailbox door creaking]\n\nSpitfire: The Wonderbolts are the fastest, best precision flyers in the world. But spin-outs can still happen. And when they do, a Wonderbolt must be able to recover quickly. This... is the Dizzitron. It's gonna make you very \u2013 I repeat \u2013 very dizzy. Your task is to try and recover and fly straight again, as soon as possible. Once you have recovered you must come in for a smooth landing. Now, who's first? [to Meadow Flower] You. You're up.\nMeadow Flower: Me? [gulps]\nSpitfire: Now! Ready?\nMeadow Flower: Yes, ma'am!\nSpitfire: Go!\n[Dizzitron spinning]\nSpitfire: Release!\nMeadow Flower: [groaning]\nSpitfire: Huh.

That's an academy record.\nMeadow Flower: You made it look so easy.\nRainbow Dash: I make everything look easy.\nSpitfire: Okay, Lightning Dust. You're up.\nLightning Dust: Ma'am, can you put the Dizzitron at maximum speed? I wanna push my limits.\nSpitfire: You sure about that?\nLightning Dust: Yes ma'am.\nSpitfire: Okay. You asked for it.\n[Dizzitron spinning rapidly]\nSpitfire: Release! Six point five seconds. Not bad.\nRainbow Dash and Lightning Dust: Heh!/Oh yeah!\nSpitfire: Next!\n\n[off-screen crash]\nRainbow Dash: No pony even came close to six seconds.\nLightning Dust: They should make us Wonderbolts right now.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, they should.\nSpitfire: Listen up! For the rest of the camp, you'll be working in pairs. 'Morrow morning, I'll post the teams, including who'll be lead pony and who'll be wingpony. Good luck.\nLightning Dust: Like we're going to need it.\nRainbow Dash: Heh, yeah.\n\nRainbow Dash: So, which one of you lucky gals gets to be my wingpony? What?\nCloudchaser: Eh, you might want to check the wall.\nRainbow Dash: A wingpony?\nLightning Dust: They made us a team! Isn't that awesome?\n\n[door opens]\nRainbow Dash: Permission to enter, ma'am.\nSpitfire: What is it, Rainbow Dash?\nRainbow Dash: I had the best time on the Dizzitron! Only six seconds!\nSpitfire: And?\nRainbow Dash: And you made me a wingpony!\nSpitfire: Because I believe you and Lightning Dust will be an unstoppable team. Do you not think you'll be an unstoppable team?\nRainbow Dash: Yes, ma'am! I mean no, ma'am! I mean... We'll be an unstoppable team, ma'am.\nSpitfire: Then what's the problem?\nRainbow Dash: I think I should be lead pony, ma'am.\nSpitfire: And I think Lightning Dust likes to push herself a little harder than you do. That's why I made her lead pony. Got it?\nRainbow Dash: Yes, ma'am.\nSpitfire: Good.\n\nSpitfire: Today you will all be participating in a flag hunt. We'll divide you into two teams, red... and blue. Whoever finds the most flags of the opposing team's color wins.\n[Pegasi cheering]\nMeadow Flower: Oh, this is gonna be so much fun!\nSpitfire: If you think this is gonna be fun, you are sadly mistaken. This is for training purposes. This is not recess. Lead ponies and wingponies must fly together. If any pair splits apart, they will be immediately disqualified. Do you understand?\nAll Pegasi: Yes, ma'am!\nSpitfire: Then let's go! [blows whistle]\nLightning Dust: Ready to rock and roll?\nRainbow Dash: Ready.\nLightning Dust: You spotted any flags yet?\nRainbow Dash: Not yet. Oh! There's one!\nLightning Dust: Good eyes!\nRainbow Dash: We should slow down. It doesn't look like both of us can make it at this speed!\nLightning Dust: Peh.\nRainbow Dash: Ow!\nSpitfire: Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash found the first flag!\nLightning Dust: Come on! Let's find some more!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, sure. Just give me a second.\nLightning Dust: Oh, you're fine.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah... totally. [groans]\n\nPinkie Pie: [snore] [gasp]\n[mailbox door creaks]\nRarity: She's still at it.\nFluttershy: I just wish we could help her.\nPinkie Pie: Help me? The only thing that could possibly help me right now is a letter from Rainbow Dash! It's been three days already. By now, she probably doesn't even know our names anymore! She probably can't remember our faces! \"Pinkie Pie? I never heard of a Pinkie Pie! Who is Pinkie Pie?\"\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, if you're so worried, then why don't you send her a letter first?\nPinkie Pie: Of course! That's a great idea!\nFluttershy, Rarity, and Applejack: [sigh of relief]\nPinkie Pie: Oh wait! I got an even better idea! How about we send Rainbow Dash a care package? You know, before she forgets all about us? Although, come on, let's face it. It's probably too late for that. But, uh, maybe it'll jog her memory somehow.\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, I'm sure Rainbow Dash still remembers our faces and who we are. But I think sending her a care package is a great idea.\nPinkie Pie: A care package it is! We'll send it through the mail! WAIT! Ah! That won't work at all!\nApplejack: Why not?\nPinkie Pie: Because what if the package gets lost in the mail? What if somepony else gets the package by accident and then she remembers us instead of Rainbow Dash and then she becomes our new friend? And then the real Rainbow Dash won't ever know that she used to have friends and she forgot them!\nApplejack: Is anypony else followin' this?\nFluttershy, Twilight, and Rarity: Mmm-mm.\nPinkie Pie: I've got it! We'll deliver the care package to Rainbow Dash in person!\nRarity: I wouldn't mind a little trip.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'll go!\nApplejack: Count me in!\nFluttershy: Me too.\nPinkie Pie: Me five! But don't be upset if she doesn't recognize you at first. It may take a while for her to get her memory back.\n\n[trumpet fanfare]\nSpitfire: Today we'll be doing our famous air obstacle course.\n[cloud spouts bursting]\nSpitfire: The object of this exercise is to work on your precision flying under extreme circumstances. And don't worry about winning. It's not a race. Now everypony, get on your marks!\n[whistle blows]\n[cloud spouts bursting]\nLightning Dust: Ugh! Can't they go any faster? It's no good, I can't get around them!\nRainbow Dash: Doesn't matter! We can still fly completely in sync and blow Spitfire's mind with our moves!\nLightning Dust: I guess...\n[rain falling]\nLightning Dust: What are they, a couple of snails? It's just a little weather.\n[lightning strikes]\nLightning Dust: Now's our chance to pass these slowpokes!\n[Pegasi screaming]\n[screech]\nSpitfire: Not bad! And in record time, too! Definitely made the right decision making you two a team. The others seem to have had a little trouble with the precision part of the exercise. I'd better go help sort them out. Why don't you two go hit the mess hall early?\nLightning Dust: Yes, ma'am!\nRainbow Dash: Thank you, ma'am. Um, Lightning Dust? Next time, maybe we don't cut the other teams off like that.\nLightning Dust: Hey, you snooze, you lose! Besides, Wonderbolts are supposed to be able to recover from a spin-out. You saw them on the Dizzitron! They could use the practice. I mean, it's not our fault we're so much better than those other guys! Not every pony is destined to become a Wonderbolt. Only the best of the best, right?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, I-I guess you're right...\nLightning Dust: 'Course I'm right! Now let's go fuel up! Kicking all that tail has made me hungry.\n\n[whistle blows]\n[cloud punching]\nBulk Biceps: [chomp] Yeah!\nLightning Dust: I have an idea about how we can literally blow away our competition.\nBulk Biceps: [growl]\nRainbow Dash: But we're already way ahead.\nLightning Dust: Are you in or not?\nSpitfire: [echoing] Lightning Dust likes to push herself a little harder than you do. That's why I made her lead pony.\nRainbow Dash: I'm in!\nLightning Dust: Then follow my lead!\n[tornado blowing]\nLightning Dust: I can't control it!\nApplejack: It's a twister!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hold on!\nMain cast sans Rainbow Dash: [scream]\nRainbow Dash: Noooooo!\nRest of main cast: [screaming]\n[boing]\nRest of main cast: [screaming] Huh?\nRainbow Dash: Are you guys okay?\nRarity, Twilight, Applejack and Fluttershy: Uh-huh.\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie Pie!\nPinkie Pie: You... remember me!\nRainbow Dash: Well... yeah, of course I remember you. But... what are you all doing here?\nApplejack: We wanted to bring you a care package. Didn't realize you'd be in the middle of some crazy tornado drill.\nLightning Dust: That... was... awesome!\nRainbow Dash: Awesome? My friends could have been smashed to pieces!\nLightning Dust: Yeah, but they weren't, right? Can't say the same for the clouds. We totally wiped them out with that tornado. The other cadets will have to be up there for days to bust as many as we did.\nRainbow Dash: A hoof bump? Seriously? You made me clip my wing. You sent half of our class into serious tailspins on the obstacle course. You unleashed a tornado that nearly demolished my friends!\nLightning Dust: Yeah, and?\nRainbow Dash: And I get that you want to be the best. So do I! But you're going about it in the wrong way.\nLightning Dust: The Wonderbolts don't seem to think so. After all, Spitfire did make me the leader and you the wingpony.\nRainbow Dash: [sigh] You're right. She did.\n\n[door opens]\nSpitfire: This better be important. You're supposed to be up there busting clouds with your partner.\nRainbow Dash: We're done with that, ma'am.\nSpitfire: Already? That's an academy record! Explain your methods.\nRainbow Dash: That's why I'm here, ma'am. Lightning Dust decided to use a tornado.\nSpitfire: A bit excessive for cloud-busting. But judging from your time, it was obviously an effective tactic.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, well that \"effective tactic\" nearly took out my friends! No disrespect, ma'am, but there's a big difference between pushing yourself as hard as you can and just being reckless. And if being reckless is what gets rewarded around here, if that's what it means to be a Wonderbolt, then I don't want any part of it.\nSpitfire: What are you saying, newbie?\nRainbow Dash: I quit.\n[door closes]\n\nApplejack: You did what?!\nRarity: Being a Wonderbolt was your dream!\nRainbow Dash: Not anymore.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash. I know how much this meant to you.\nSpitfire: Rainbow Dash! How dare you storm out of my office without giving me a chance to respond! The Wonderbolts are looking for the best flyers in Equestria, but you were right. Being the best should never come at the expense of our fellow ponies. It's not just about pushing ourselves. It's about pushing ourselves in the right direction. You've shown that you're capable of doing just that. You're no wingpony, Rainbow Dash. You're a leader.\nRainbow Dash: OhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygosh!\nSpitfire: Now get out there and give me twenty!\nRainbow Dash: Yes, ma'am!\nPinkie Pie: Wait!

I'll show ya!\n\nGranny Smith: We've been hostin' these things at Sweet Apple Acres every hundred moons since we first planted roots here in Ponyville.\nApple Bloom: Hey, who's that?\nGranny Smith: That'd be your Great-Great-Auntie Applesauce when she was just about your age. Now, she used to go by another name, but everypony started calling her Applesauce after half her teeth fell out when she was makin' apple jam. Yeah. Never did find them teeth in all those jars.\nApple Bloom: Hey! That's you, Granny!\nGranny Smith: Sure is. Apple family's been workin' on that same old quilt since our first reunion.\n\nYoung Granny Smith: I can do it! Ngh! Oh, fingle-fangle!\n[ponies laughing]\n\nApple Bloom: [giggling]\nGranny Smith: Well, nopony told me you actually had to knot the end of the thread!\nApple Bloom: [giggling]\nApplejack: Okay, so I'll need to get new quiltin' materials, fabric, needles, thread... You've really been workin' on the same quilt since the first reunion?\nGranny Smith: Surely have. I don't think we're ever gonna finish that doggone thing!\nApple Bloom: Hey, what's goin' on here?\nGranny Smith: Well, you know us Apples enjoy a good fritter...\n\n[splat]\nHalf Baked Apple: [licking lips] [munches]\u00a0Ooo, hot hot hot!\n[firetruck's bell ringing]\n[apple cider splashes]\n[plate clinking]\nApple Split: Hey, where did all them apple fritters go?\nBaby Applejack: [munches]\nApple Split: And...\nBaby Applejack: [baby noises]\nApple Split: Who are you, little one?\nBaby Applejack: I'm Applejack! More apple fwitter?\n\nGranny Smith: That's how we figured out your sister had the appetite of a full-grown stallion.\nApplejack: Better get twice as much honey and flour, then... fifty more buckets of apples... more oil... wood for the fire...\nGranny Smith: Now, stick an apple in my mouth and roast my rump! This one sure brings back memories. Y'know how Babs is your favorite cousin? Well, Apple Rose is mine. The two of us entered the seven-legged race every reunion!\n\nYoung Apple Rose: We're gonna win this one, cousin!\nYoung Granny Smith: You bet your hot-diggety-derriere we are! C'mon, cousin, speed'er on up!\nYoung Apple Rose: [yelps] [laughs]\nYoung Apple Rose and Young Granny Smith: [laughing]\n\nGranny Smith: Never won a single one of them races.\nApplejack: Races. We'll need cloth ties, finish line... Not much to a seven-legged race. Hmm...\nGranny Smith: And, of course, we can't forget to take the big family photo! We always snapped a photo in front of the barn at the end of every reunion, lets us see how our family's grown!\nApplejack: Photo in front of the barn. Got it.\nApple Bloom: You sure have some great memories of these reunions, don'tcha?\nGranny Smith: Indeedy, and I'm lookin' forward to makin' more at this one. Oh, I'm sure everypony is, and I do mean everypony! We got the whole family together this time 'round! Who knows if they'll all be able to make the next one?\nApplejack: That's true! Busy as everypony's lives are gettin' these days, chances are pretty slim we'll be this lucky next time 'round. Don't worry, Granny, I'm gonna make sure this is the most memorable reunion we've ever had! I'd better get started... I've got some plannin' to do!\nGranny Smith: Oh, hootenanny! Would you look what your second cousin is wearin' on her head?\nApple Bloom and Granny Smith: [giggling]\n\n[clock pendulum ticking]\nApple Bloom: [groans]\nApplejack: Apple Bloom! What are you doin' up?\nApple Bloom: I was gonna ask you the same thing.\nApplejack: I can't sleep. My gears are turnin' in my head about this reunion!\nApple Bloom: [yawning] Yeah... I can't wait to see my cousin Babs. We're gonna do so many fun things together...\nApplejack: Fun? That's just the beginnin' of it! Granny Smith handed me the reins of this reunion, and I'm gonna make the most of it. Apple Bloom, I've got so many things planned you won't even have a minute's rest!\nApple Bloom: [snoring]\nApplejack: Trust me, little sis. This reunion I'm puttin' together is gonna be worth the wait.\nApple Bloom: [snoring]\n\n[rooster crows]\nApple Bloom: [snoring] Whoa!\nApplejack: Rise and shine! We don't have much time!\n[thump]\n[dragging sounds]\n\n[bucking trees, apples falling]\n\n[bees buzzing]\nPinkie Pie: [belches] Don't forget the glitter!\nApplejack: [coughs]\n\n[rain falling]\n[lightning cracking]\nRainbow Dash: [whistling]\n\nSpike: [clicking noises] [breathes fire]\n\nApplejack: H-ah. Think that'll do it!\nGranny Smith: And just in time, too.\n[rumbling]\nApplejack: They're here!\n[ponies shouting]\nGranny Smith: Apple Rose! Ohhh! Ooh, this is more excitin' than when it rained frogs!\n[microphone feedback]\nApplejack: [through megaphone] Howdy, y'all, and welcome to the Apple family reunion!\n[ponies cheering]\nApplejack: [through megaphone] My name's Applejack, and I just want to let y'all know that I got a real big day planned for ya! We're gonna start off with an obstacle course for the young'uns, and some fritter makin' and quiltin' for the not-so-young'uns. And there's lots more to come after that! Hope y'all enjoy it!\n[ponies cheering]\nApple Bloom: Where is she?\nBabs Seed: [blows]\nApple Bloom: Babs!\nBabs Seed: Cuz!\nApple Bloom: I know it hasn't been that long since we've seen each other, but\u2013\nApple Bloom and Babs Seed: \u2013It felt like forever!\nBabs Seed: I can't wait to tell you about my new school!\nApple Bloom: I can't wait to hear all about it!\nBabs Seed: Jeepers, where do I start? Okay. So first day\u2013\nApplejack: Babs! Huh, so glad you could come!\nBabs Seed: What am I, gonna miss out on spendin' time with my favorite cousin? Forget about it! [blows]\nApplejack: Why don't you two head over to the obstacle course?\nApple Bloom: We kinda wanna catch up a little bit first...\nApplejack: Don't you worry. There'll be plenty of time for family bondin' while you're racin' against your other cousins.\n\nApplejack: Alrighty, ponies! Ready to have some fun?\nBabs Seed: Whoa, is that the finish line? It's like a mile away or somethin'!\nApplejack: Actually, that's just the marker where you go on to the next leg of the race.\nApple Bloom: There's more?\nApplejack: Much more. Trust me, I have put together somethin' you are never gonna forget. After the seven-legged race, you're gonna wanna hurry up and head over here, where you'll be bobbin' for apples!\n[splash]\nApplejack: Then you'll run around these trees fifty times until you're real good and dizzy. Then you'll jump these big wooden hurdles. And then there's the final leg, where you'll balance plates on your head while sayin' \"Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets\" over and over and over again. Last pony standin' wins!\n[pause]\nApple Bloom: Seriously?\nApplejack: Seriously! C'mon, y'all! Let's start makin' some memories! On your mark... get set... go!\n\nApplejack: Whooeee! Lookin' good, everypony! Ooh, better go check on the quilt.\n\nGranny Smith: How long you had those new choppers, Auntie Applesauce?\nAuntie Applesauce: A lady never reveals the age of her teeth.\nApple Rose: Ugh.\nAuntie Applesauce: Don't you roll your eyes at me, Miss Apple Rose! I imagine you two think I have forgotten what you did to my parasol six reunions ago?\nGranny Smith: [giggles] We were just usin' it to help break open that pi\u00f1ata!\nApple Rose and Granny Smith: [laughing]\nAuntie Applesauce: Applejack, delightful to see you. Are you gonna join us in some quiltin'?\nApplejack: Sorry, Auntie Applesauce, I am busy-busy-busy. Y'all should get started, though!\nGranny Smith: We couldn't find our rocking chairs.\nApplejack: I got rid of 'em to make room for these. This is the year y'all are finally gonna finish that quilt!\nApple Rose: Finish it?\n[engine starting]\n[very loud sewing machine rattling]\n[Auntie Applesauce's teeth chattering]\nApplejack: [over noise] Won't that be excitin'?\nApple Rose: [over noise] What's that?\nApplejack: [over noise] I said, won't that be\u2013\n[rattling stops]\nApplejack: \u2013excitin'?\nAuntie Applesauce: I suppose, although I have been told that too much excitement can wreak havoc on this youthful complexion of mine.\nApple Rose: Oh.\nGranny Smith: [giggling]\n[rattling restarts]\nApplejack: [over noise] That's the spirit!\nGranny Smith: [over noise] What did she say?\nApple Rose: [over noise] What?\nGranny Smith: [over noise] Good gracious!\nApple Rose: [over noise] Golden Delicious? I think he's racing with his cousin!\n\n[dizzy music]\nBabs Seed: [dizzy] How are Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle?\nApple Bloom: [dizzy] Great! Ugh...\nBabs Seed: [dizzy] You alright?\nApple Bloom: [dizzy] So... dizzy... [Wilhelm scream]\n[crash]\nApple Bloom: Ugh...\nBabs Seed: [sigh]\n\n[splat]\nBig McIntosh: [sniffs] [licks lips] [gulps] [whistles innocently]\nApple Dumpling: You've got eight now, dont'cha?\nApple Leaves: Oh, sure do. Tell you what, my Apple Tart may just be a baby, but he is a hoot!\nApplejack: Havin' fun?\nApple Leaves: Sure are!\nApplejack: Better pick up the pace on those fritters though, huh? Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left. Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left. Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left. Now you try! That's it! Gotta keep this assembly line movin', gals! We want every Apple here to get a chance to taste the best darn fritters in Equestria!\n\nApple Bloom and Babs Seed: Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets.\nApple Bloom: Any other blank flanks at your new school?\nBabs Seed: Yeah. Two.\nApple Bloom and Babs Seed: Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets.\nApple Bloom: Do they wanna be Crusaders?\nBabs Seed: Totally!\nApple Bloom: Great!\nApple Bloom and Babs Seed: Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets. Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets. Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets.\nBabs Seed: Ah can' thfeel my tongue.\nApple Bloom: Neh nehber.\n\nApplejack: [through megaphone] Alright, Apples, break!\n[sewing machine rattling stops]\nApple Bloom: [sighs] Finally...\nApplejack: Ooh, can't forget to capture all these memories for Granny's album! Huh. Nothin' all that memorable there. Or there. Or there. C'mon, Applejack, think. You gotta kick this thing up a notch! Hm...\n\nApple Bloom: I get that my big sis wants this to be like a super-awesome reunion, but that was ridiculous!\nBabs Seed: I thought we'd never get a minute to just hang out!\nApplejack: And your minute's up! Your fellow Apples are waitin' for you to join them.\nApple Bloom: Applejack, I haven't had any time with Babs! We were so busy with that obstacle course, we didn't even get to talk!\nApplejack: There'll be plenty of time to bond with Babs when we do the hayride.\nBabs Seed: Hayride?\n\nApplejack: Alright, everypony! Step right up, take a seat, and leave the drivin' to these stallions! Now, I know y'all've been workin' real hard makin' some awesome memories. And in all of our past reunions, we always had a nice and relaxin' hayride around the farm. Which is why I decided to change things up a bit, and try somethin' just a wee bit more excitin'. So let's get this show on the road! Giddy-up!\nStallions: [whinnying]\nPonies: Whoa!\n[crunch]\n[Auntie Applesauce's teeth chattering]\n[chomp]\nAuntie Applesauce: [teethless] I just had those professionally polished.\nGranny Smith: Where in the world does that girl have us headed? The west orchard?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nGranny Smith: What?! I was jokin'! Why, we haven't tended those fields since all the trees went and got filled up with... [gulps]\n[thunk]\n[fruit bats squeaking]\n[ponies oohing and ahhing]\nBabs Seed: Wowza! Never seen real fruit bats before!\n[fruit bat licking lips]\n[aeroplane engine noises]\nApplejack: Uh-oh.\nAuntie Applesauce: [yelps]\n[ponies yelping]\nApple Bloom: Everypony! Jump out!!\n[crash]\n\nApplejack: [crying] Ruined. Everythin' is ruined.\n[crunch]\nApplejack: Oh, Granny. I'm so, so sorry.\nGranny Smith: Oh, it's alright, child.\nApplejack: But it's not alright. Just look at this! The barn and all my plans for the perfect family reunion are completely destroyed!\nApple Bloom: Maybe that's a good thing.\nApplejack: How can that possibly be a good thing?\nGranny Smith: Applejack, you had us so caught up in all the doin', we haven't had a second to enjoy the company of the folks we've been doin' it with!\nApplejack: Really?\n[ponies agreeing]\nApplejack: [sighs] Oh, Granny Smith, here you let me be in charge of creatin' great memories, and the only thing anypony's gonna remember about this reunion... is that it was the worst one we ever had.\nGranny Smith: Oh, hey now... everypony's still here, ain't they? Still plenty of time to make good memories! You've just got to give everypony a chance to actually make 'em.\nApplejack: The family photo! Guess we can't take it in front of the barn this year... unless... Everypony! I have one more activity!\nGranny Smith: Applejack...\nApplejack: Trust me, Granny Smith.

Turns out that when you're with folks you care about, you don't have to do much to make that time memorable. Even the simplest of activities can take on a whole lotta meanin'! And you'll find that you'll remember the \"who\" long after you've forgotten the \"what\".\n\nYour humble subject,\nApplejack\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nSpike: Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh. That's not that many.\nSpike: Are you kidding? How are you supposed to read twelve books in one weekend?\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Celestia obviously thinks I can or she would never have assigned them to me. I'm not planning on letting her down.\nSpike: Well, I hope you're not planning on sleeping then, either.\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, Spike, why don't you take the day off?\nSpike: Really?\nTwilight Sparkle: Why not? These books are gonna keep me busy for a while.\nSpike: Hmm... I do have a long list of things I've been dying to do!\n\nSpike: \"Touch nose with tongue.\" Eeeng... done! \"Play bongos on my belly.\"\n[bongo drum sounds]\nSpike: Done! \"Smell my dirty feet.\" [sniffs] [sigh] Done!

I-if I didn't know better, I would swear that I was in the middle of the dark and scary Everfree Forest.\n[twig snaps]\nSpike: [yelps] What was that?! C'mon, Spike. Just because this forest is full of wild dangerous animals, doesn't mean that you're gonna see one!

I'm running!\n[barking]\nSpike: [yelping]\nApplejack: Whew!\nSpike: Wow, Applejack! That was amazing! I mean, you rocketed those boulders at them like they were... rockets! Pow, pow, pow pow pow! You saved my life! [softly] You... saved... my life.\nApplejack: Aw, don't mention it, Spike. C'mon, we should be headin' on back, now.\nSpike: Man, am I lucky you were out here. Uh, why were you out here?\nApplejack: Saw the balloon floatin' by with nopony in it, came out here to investigate. Guess you did too, huh?\nSpike: Uh... yeah... I was investigating the runaway hot air balloon too! So, uh, now that the mystery's been solved, let's get outta here, huh?\n[distant howling]\n\nApplejack: Thanks for walkin' me home, Spike. That was mighty kind of you. But now I have chores that need tendin' to, so see you later.\nSpike: What chores? I'll do them!\nApplejack: That's sweet, but you don't have\u2013\nSpike: It's the least I can do! You saved my life! I need to repay the favor.\nApplejack: Shoot, Spike, that's what friends do for each other. You don't need to repay the favor.\nSpike: Yes, I do!\nApplejack: Sugar, it's okay, it's not necessary.\nSpike: Applejack, you don't understand! This is something I really need to do!\nApplejack: Well, I'd hate to get in the way of doin' somethin' you need to do...\nSpike: Great! What should I do?\nApplejack: Uh... Apple Bloom's over yonder givin' little Piggington a bath. I was gonna lend her a hoof, but maybe you could lend her one instead.\nSpike: On the double!\n\nSpike: Applejack said I could help you!\n[pig snorts]\nApple Bloom: Great! I could use all the help I can get!\n[thud]\nSpike: Heh, wait 'til Applejack sees how you sparkle!\n\n[pig squealing]\nSpike: Ta-da!\n[pig oinks]\nApplejack: Good job, you two.\nApple Bloom: Applejack, is it okay if I get goin'?

I reckon you have repaid me in full so we are officially even Steven.\nSpike: What? Ohhh no. We aren't even close to being even Steven! Please, Applejack, you must allow me to assist you further!\nApplejack: I dunno, Spike. Just don't feel right to have you, uh, doin' things for me.\nSpike: Please?\nApplejack: Really, you don't\u2013\nSpike: Pretty please?\nApplejack: It's just not necessary\u2013\nSpike: Pretty pretty pretty please?\nApplejack: [sigh] Oh, all right. You can help Granny Smith and me bake some\u2013\n\nSpike: Pies! Pies! I'm helping Applejack make some pies!\nGranny Smith: Uh, Spike, little feller, could you get us some more eggs?\nSpike: Coming right up!

Lemme get something to clean that up!\n[thud, splash]\n[poof]\n[splat]\nApplejack: [sighs] Appreciate all your help today, sugarcube, but... I can take it from here.\nSpike: Don't be ridiculous! It is my honor and my duty! Today's just the beginning!\nApplejack: What's that now?\nSpike: You saved my life! [belches] According to the \"Spike the Dragon Code\", I owe you a life debt and must serve you.\nGranny Smith: Now, what about Twilight? Doesn't she need your help and such?\nSpike: [breathes fire] Huh, you're right. I better break the news to Twilight. I just hope she doesn't take it too hard... Be right back!\n[splat]\n\nSpike: Come on, Spike, this is your personal, moral, ethical dragon code we're talking about! You have to do this! It's not like you and Twilight won't be friends anymore... but it won't be the same... but it has to be done. [to Twilight] Twilight, Applejack just saved my life from horrible, dragon-eating timberwolves!\nTwilight Sparkle: Mm-hmm...\nSpike: And, as you are aware, I adhere to my dragon code, and this means I must serve her for the rest of my natural born days! I'm sure you understand.\nTwilight Sparkle: Mm-hmm...\nSpike: It's... been an honor... being your faithful assistant.\nTwilight Sparkle: Sounds good.\nSpike: [sighs]\n\nSpike: She said it was okay.\nApplejack and Granny Smith: Really?\nSpike: So, with Twilight's blessing, I'm free to follow my code and serve you until\u2013\n[crash]\nSpike: Well, until forever!\n\nApplejack: Listen, sugarcube, I completely respect your \"dragon code\"... Truly I do, but I just can't cotton with you permanently servin' me.\nSpike: Please, Applejack, my dragon code is a part of me! I have to be true to myself! If you don't let me do this, I won't be a noble dragon anymore!\nApplejack: Oh, well, I can't have you feelin' like you're not a noble dragon now, can I?\nSpike: Great! Then from here on in, your wish is my command.\n[pause]\nApplejack: Oh, uh, okay... I would like you to... hmm... huh... oh! ...Help me take some of the pie you made to...\nSpike: Rarity?\nApplejack: Uh, sure, why not?\n\nSpike: I helped bake it.\nRarity: Eugh. [chewing]\nSpike: You even look good when you're chewing... [laughs nervously] W-who looks good when they're chewing?\nRarity: [spits]\nSpike: Aren't you gonna have some more?\nRarity: I... had a big lunch!\nSpike: It's ten in the morning.\nRarity: Breakfast. A big breakfast.\nSpike: Ohhh. Okay.\nApplejack: Maybe you could take her plate back to the kitchen and wash it off?\nSpike: As you wish!\nRarity: What was that all about?\nApplejack: [sighs] I saved Spike from some timberwolves in the Everfree Forest, and now he thinks he has to serve me forever.\nRarity: [delighted squeal] Oh, what I wouldn't give to have somepony forever in my debt! I'd get them to organize my closets, and give me pedicures, and help me with my sewing and\u2013\nApplejack: Okay, I get it, havin' somepony to do things for you would be a dream come true. But I don't feel right havin' Spike thinkin' he owes me somethin'. And you tasted that pie. Sometimes, his help isn't that helpful.\n[crash]\nSpike: Do you... have a broom I could borrow?\n[soap bubbles bubbling]\nRainbow Dash: AJ, Rarity, what's happening?\nRarity: Applejack saved Spike's life and now he has to serve her forever.\nRainbow Dash: Sweet! What are you having him do? Wash your laundry? Clean your room? Help you with your unfinished novel? Mine's about this awesome Pegasus who's the best flyer ever and becomes the captain of the Wonderbolts!\nRarity: [sarcastic] How ever did you come up with that ingeniously woven intricate plot line?\nRainbow Dash: Just came to me.\nApplejack: Thing is, I don't really want him to serve me forever, but I don't know how to get him to stop.\nRainbow Dash: That's easy! Just make him help you with something really, really hard.\nApplejack: I dunno. I don't want him to get hurt.\nRainbow Dash: Puh-lease. He'll quit way before there's even a chance of getting hurt!\n[crash]\nRainbow Dash: [hushed, to Applejack] Leave this to me. [to Spike] Sooo, Spike, Applejack was gonna help me stack some hay so I could practice smashing through it, but I'm feeling extra, extra powerful today.\nApplejack: You are?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, I am. So instead of hay, I'm gonna smash through rocks!\nSpike: Rocks?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! A huge tower of rocks! And you're gonna build it!\nSpike: I am?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, I mean, unless you don't wanna help Applejack...\nSpike: I do! It is Spike's dragon code!\nRainbow Dash: Then get to it! [to Applejack] Trust me. This is gonna work like a charm!\n\nSpike: [sounds of exertion]\nRainbow Dash: Huh. I was sure he'd give up after, like, three rocks.\nFluttershy: Oh, goodness. If it'd been me, I'd have just pretended I didn't have anything for him to do.\nApplejack: Why didn't I think of that?\nSpike: [yelling] Is this high enough?\nApplejack: That's plenty high! Come on down, Spike!\nRainbow Dash: Bad news: He actually ended up building the whole rock tower. Good news... [nervously] I've got a rock tower to knock down.\nSpike: Haha, yeah! You can do it! Haha, hahah, alright, yeah!\n[crash]\nSpike: That... was... awesome!\n[thud]\nSpike: Wanna do it again, Rainbow Dash? Applejack can rebuild it for you. And when I say \"Applejack\", I of course mean me!\nRainbow Dash: [dazed] Sure! Why not...?\nApplejack: No! I mean, I don't think Rainbow Dash needs any more of your help. My help. She doesn't need it. Right, Rainbow Dash?\nRainbow Dash: Bbbbrrr. Yeah. I guess I'm good. For now.\nApplejack: And so am I! I just can't think of one more thing I need help with, so you don't have to do anything else.\n[thud]\nSpike: W-What do you mean you can't think of anything else I can help with?\nApplejack: Exactly that! There's nothin' else. I don't want you to do anything.\nSpike: If I don't help you, how will I know I'm a noble dragon?\nApplejack: Well, I\u2013\nSpike: Maybe there's things you need help with, but you don't even realize you need help with!\nFluttershy: If she needed help, I think she'd realize it.\nSpike: Maybe not! Maybe Applejack needs help realizing what she needs help with. Like... maybe your back itches!\nApplejack: Huuuuh... that does feel... good...\nSpike: [laughs] See? Or you might need help remembering your favorite song! \"The dragon is the finest creature ever, there's more to him than just guarding treasure...\"\nFluttershy: I don't think that's her favorite s\u2013\nSpike: Or... you might need help breathing!\nApplejack: Breathin'? I certainly do not\u2013\n[bellows pumping]\n[air being let out of balloon]\nSpike: See? There are plenty of things I can help you with, and you don't even have to trouble yourself with thinking of them!\nApplejack: No, I'll think of 'em. Lemme think of 'em.\nSpike: As you wish.\n\nApplejack: Twilight? Twilight, are you there? Twilight!\n[clatter]\nTwilight Sparkle: Agh!\nApplejack: Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] No, it's okay, I need to take a break anyway. What's going on?\nApplejack: I know Spike told you that he was gonna follow his dragon code, and serve me forever for savin' him from the timberwolves, and that you were okay with it, but\u2013\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait, what?\nApplejack: He said he told you all about it. I'm guessin' maybe you were a little distracted when he told you.\nTwilight Sparkle: Um, maybe a little...\nApplejack: I should've realized you wouldn't have let him go so easily. Well, now that you know what's goin' on, maybe you could talk some sense into him!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Applejack, I wish I could, but this is dragon code we're talking about. Surely you know how important the dragon code is to a dragon!\nApplejack: I sure am startin' to.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hm, there's only one other way Spike is gonna fulfill the debt he feels he owes you.\n\nSpike: Seventy, seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three, seventy-four, seventy-five...\nApplejack: All right, y'all, here's the deal. Spike needs to save my life.\nPinkie Pie: And you want us to shoot you out of a cannon towards a hornet's nest and give Spike a butterfly net so he can catch you mere seconds before you hit the nest and are stung by a thousand angry hornets! I'll wear this mustache.\nApplejack: No. I am gonna be attacked by a timberwolf!\nRarity, Twilight Sparkle, Fluttershy, and Rainbow Dash: [gasping]\nPinkie Pie: Can I still wear the mustache?\n\nApplejack: When I give the signal, Pinkie Pie and Rarity will come runnin' out of the woods, bein' pursued by the timberwolf. I'll start to run too, but then pretend to get my hoof stuck. I'll ask Spike to help me dislodge it, and he will, and I'll be able to get away from the terrifyin' timberwolf! Havin' saved me from certain doom, Spike will then consider us even. Everybody get it?\nFluttershy and Rainbow Dash: Uh-huh.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'll do my best.\nRarity: Mm-hmm.\nPinkie Pie: Just one question.\nApplejack: Yes? [beat] No.\nPinkie Pie: [sighs] Suit yourself.\n[crash]\nRarity: [clears throat] We are all ready to play our parts, ahem, but are you sure you are ready to play yours, Applejack?\nApplejack: What d'you mean?\nRarity: Show us your best \"damsel in distress\" move.\nApplejack: Uh... Oh, well, aheh, how's this? Hooooooo.\nRarity: Absolutely horrendous! Okay, this needs some serious work! Now, first, you must lift your foreleg up to your forehead, like so\u2013\nSpike: [in distance] Applejack?\nApplejack: No time! Here he comes! Uh... over here, Spike!\nSpike: [pants] You said you had something else you needed me to do?\nApplejack: Oh, yes, I, I was just hopin' you could maybe, uh, sweep up all those leaves for a compost pile, and\u2013\nSpike: But of course. Oh, by the way, there are exactly twenty-four million, five hundred and sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred and thirty seven blades of grass at Sweet Apple Acres.\nApplejack: I can't believe you counted every single one of 'em...\nSpike: You asked me to.\nRainbow Dash: [inhales]\nSpike: And, as a noble dragon and follower of my dragon code, I\u2013\nRainbow Dash: [roars like a timberwolf]\nFluttershy: That was very convincing!\nRarity: [screaming] Timberwolf! [sobbing] We are doomed!\nPinkie Pie: [screams]\nRarity: [to Applejack] See? Like that.\n[wood clacking]\n[wood stomping]\nRainbow Dash: [quietly laughing] [roars like a timberwolf]\nApplejack: [unconvincingly] Oh no! I seem to have got my hoof caught in between two rocks! I cannot run away! I am a damsel in distress! Help me, Spike!\nSpike: Wait a minute.\nApplejack: No, no, don't wait a minute. Save me from the terrifyin' timberwolf!\nSpike: Well, he would be terrifying if he wasn't a fake! You got the clomping on his claws...\n[string snapping]\nSpike: ...The roar was spot on, and the detail on his face is pretty good. But you forgot one thing: his breath! You could smell a real timberwolf's breath from a mile\u2013 [sniffs] [laughs] Too late, I'm already on\u2013\n[magical poof]\nTwilight Sparkle: [screams]\nRainbow Dash: Timberwolf!\n[wolf snorts]\n[timberwolves roaring]\nSpike: Timberwolf!\n[barking]\n[crunching]\nApplejack: Whooooah!\n[crash]\nApplejack: Ow!\n[wolf howling in distance]\n[wood clicking]\nSpike: Uh oh... Applejack, come on!\nApplejack: [grunting] I can't! I'm really stuck!\nSpike: No more messing around! Let's go!\nApplejack: [grunting] Come on...\n[giant timberwolf roaring]\nApplejack: Forget it, Spike! You gotta get out of here! Would you just forget your dragon code already and go?!\nSpike: No! I have to save you!\n[crunch]\n[giant timberwolf choking]\nSpike: Let's get out of here! [grunts]\n[giant timberwolf coughing]\n[crash]\n\nApplejack and Spike: [panting]\nTwilight Sparkle: What happened to you guys back there? Thought you were right behind us!\nApplejack: My hoof was stuck, and that timberwolf was coming right at me!\nRarity: Wait, you were actually stuck?\nSpike: Uh-huh!\nApplejack: But Spike picked up a pebble, and rocketed that thing right at the huge timberwolf's mouth, and saved my life!\nSpike: Aw, it was nothing.\nApplejack: It was somethin' alright! 'Course, I wouldn't've needed help if I hadn't been tryin' to stage a fake timberwolf attack in the first place.\nSpike: Yeah, what was that all about?\nApplejack: [sighs] I know this code thing's important to you, but if somethin' like this comes up in the future, think maybe we can go back to my code, say \"that's what friends do\" and leave it at that? I promise I won't think of you as any less noble.\nSpike: Sounds good to me. But, maybe let's just try to avoid situations where one of us actually needs the other one to save their life?\nApplejack: You got yourself a deal.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks, Spike.\nSpike: Happy to help!\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't know what I'd do without you.\nSpike: No, really! I'm really really really happy to help you!\nTwilight Sparkle: [laughs] Oh...\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nPinkie Pie: I love it when Princess Celestia comes to Ponyville! I got my hooves shined just like Rarity for the occasion. Ya like?\nRarity: I certainly do!\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm surprised she's not here yet.\nSpike: [sighs] I wonder what's taking so long?\nTwilight Sparkle: And where are Applejack and Fluttershy?\nRarity: Fluttershy's detained helping Applejack with a mishap at Sweet Apple Acres. They'll be along.\nSpike: But, I still don't get why the Princess would be so late.\nTwilight Sparkle: She's bringing an important visitor. That could be part of it.\nRainbow Dash: A visitor who's important and slow.\nRarity: Maybe it's somepony so terribly important, she still had many more terribly important things to do before she got here.\nSpike: [gasp] Maybe the visitor has a deer antler, a goat leg, a bat wing, and a snake tail!\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah, right. That's Discord.\nRarity: Why in the wide, wide world of Equestria would Princess Celestia bring along someone like that?\nSpike: M-m-maybe you should ask... her!\nRarity: Huh?\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: With all due respect, Princess Celestia, how could you bring Discord here?! [clears throat] Your majesty.\nPrincess Celestia: I'm fully aware that the last time Discord was here, he created serious havoc.\nRainbow Dash: If by \"serious havoc\" you mean \"turning Ponyville into the chaos capital of the world\"...\nRarity: ...and tricking us all into being the opposite of our true selves...\nPinkie Pie: And making yummy delicious chocolate milk rain all over the place without a single dollop of whipped cream to go with it anywhere in sight! Not a single dollop!\nPrincess Celestia: Yes, I understand. But I have use for Discord's magic if it can be reformed to serve good instead of evil. This is why I've brought Discord here, because I believe that you are the ponies who can help him do just that.\nSpike: This will never work! This is a disaster! How will we ever control him?! We're doomed!\nPrincess Celestia: Need I remind you that you are the ponies who turned him back into stone like this in the first place?\nTwilight Sparkle: I suppose we can just use the Elements of Harmony against him again if it gets out of hand.\nSpike: Uh, w-w-we probably need a volunteer to run away from here right away to get them. I'll do it!\nPrincess Celestia: No need, Spike. I have them right here, and I've cast a spell so Discord can't take them and hide them again. Now where is Fluttershy? I believe she may know best how to begin reforming Discord.\nRainbow Dash: Fluttershy? Really?\n\n[beaver chittering]\nApplejack: What's he goin' on about now?\nFluttershy: Good news. Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth has agreed to take his dam apart and move it.\nApplejack: Well, it's about time. My apple trees are so waterlogged, I can practically hear 'em gargle!\n[beaver loudly complaining]\nFluttershy: But he says first you'll have to apologize for calling him \"a nuisance\".\nApplejack: Apologize? He's lucky I didn't call him a varmint!\n[beaver loudly complaining]\nFluttershy: [gasps] Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth! Such language!\nApplejack: Fine, fine. I apologize.\n[beaver blowing raspberry]\nApplejack: [growls]\n[logs tumbling]\n[splash]\nApplejack: [sighs] Thanks, Fluttershy. Don't know what I would've done without you.\nFluttershy: Glad I could help.\nRainbow Dash: Hey, slackers! Double time it on over to Ponyville, would ya?! We're all waiting on you!\n\nPrincess Celestia: I realize that this is a tall order, but I wouldn't ask if I weren't confident you could get him to use magic obediently of his own free will.\nFluttershy: And... you really think I'll know best how to do that?\nPrincess Celestia: I do. Now, I must return to Canterlot for Equestria's royal summit. You may release Discord when ready.\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, ponies, guess it's time to get started. Let's just hope this releasing spell works.\nSpike: Or... let's not.\nTwilight Sparkle: We'd best keep our elements on at all times 'til further notice.\nRest of main cast: Check!\n[magical warbling]\n[rock cracking]\nDiscord: [screaming] [yawns] Oh! Ooh! Ooooh! Well, it's about time somepony got me out of that prison block. What a relief! [snaps fingers]\n[twig snaps]\nMain cast: [gasps]\nTwilight Sparkle: What do you think you're doing?!\nDiscord: Nnnnnnnnngh\u2013 Why, stretching, of course. When you're a creature of chaos, stone bodysuits aren't your typical go-to fashion choice. Nnngh... [snaps fingers]\n[discorded bunny screeches]\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] Make that bunny cute again! Now!\nDiscord: Oh... [sniggers] He's adorable the way he is.\n[bunny chomps]\nDiscord: [blows raspberry] You know what else is adorable? You ponies truly believe that you can reform me, and that you're putting your faith in this one here to make it happen. Makes me wanna pinch your little horsey cheeks...\nTwilight Sparkle: How'd you know about that?!\nDiscord: Being turned to stone doesn't keep me from hearing every word Celestia says. Although I admit it makes rolling my eyes a challenge.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, unless you want us to turn you back to stone, you'll zap those animals back the way they were, pronto!\nDiscord: Oh, you wouldn't dare turn me back to stone and risk disappointing your precious princess.\nRainbow Dash: Try us, \"Dip-cord\"!\nFluttershy: You think you can treat poor defenseless animals like that and get away with it?!\nRainbow Dash: You go, Fluttershy!\nFluttershy: You'd best watch your step, buster, or I'll give you... the Stare!\nDiscord: [sarcastically] The Stare? Oh no, please, not that! Anything but your disapproving eyeballs! [laughs] Oh no! No no no, stop! No, no! [strangled noises] I can't! Stop! I can't take it anymore! I'll do whatever you say! Because... [laughs] You're hilarious! [laughs]\nTwilight Sparkle: If it turns out we need to use our elements against you, I'm sure we can convince Princess Celestia it was for a good reason!\nDiscord: Mmm... I suppose that's correct. [snaps fingers]\n[bunny chittering]\nDiscord: [snaps fingers on tail]\n[beavers chittering]\nDiscord: [to audience, under his breath] Oopsie! [normally] Well, it looks like I know where I'll be crashing while I'm being \"reformed\"... With you, Fluttershy. [laughs]\nFluttershy: Oh, dear.\n\nFluttershy: He may be horrible, but that doesn't mean we have to act the same way. We should at least try to be hospitable. [to Angel] You don't mind giving up your favorite spot on the couch, do you, Angel Bunny?\nAngel: [angry squeaking]\nFluttershy: Oh, I'm sorry about Angel. Are you alright?\nDiscord: Oh, yes. Thank you, Fluttershy, for your concern. If only your pony friends could be as considerate...\nRainbow Dash: Don't listen to him, Fluttershy! He's just trying to drive a wedge between us like he always does.\nDiscord: Now why in the world would I ever try to do a thing like that?\nRainbow Dash: So we can't unite and use the Elements of Harmony against you, that's why!\nDiscord: I never thought of that...\nRainbow Dash: You big liar!\nDiscord: Now, look who's a liar. Anyone can plainly see that I'm not big at all.\n[crash]\nDiscord: Oops. [snaps fingers] There, all better. [cracks tail like a whip]\nApplejack: I can't watch...\nRainbow Dash: We'll be outside.\nTwilight Sparkle: You sure you're okay with this?\nFluttershy: I know it's not gonna be easy, but Princess Celestia's counting on me. And... I think I actually know what to do.\nTwilight Sparkle: You do?\nAngel Bunny: [angry squeaking, continues under]\nFluttershy: I think the key is to befriend him. Being kind to him and letting him be my house guest is probably the best way to do that.\nTwilight Sparkle: And you really think that'll work?\nFluttershy: I think it's worth a try.\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, but if you need us, all you need to do is whisper \"help\", and we'll be back here with our elements. [to Discord] So watch that goat-legged step of yours, pal!\nDiscord: Wh-what?! Look at me! I'm practically reformed already.\n[door closes]\nRarity: She's really alright with him staying there?\nTwilight Sparkle: That's what she said.\nRainbow Dash: Personally, I think we should come up with a backup plan, in case this whole \"befriending\" business doesn't work out.\nRarity: Rainbow Dash is right. This is Discord we are talking about, girls. It wouldn't be a bad idea to have another trick up our sleeves.\nTwilight Sparkle: And I think I know just the trick.\n\nFluttershy: Discord? Oh, there you are. Listen, Discord, I just want to make sure you know that if there's anything I can do to\u2013 uh, umm, are you eating... paper?\nDiscord: [gulp] Am I? Huh, how odd of me. [chews]\nFluttershy: Well, um... I'm just heading out, so you just make yourself at home while I'm gone.\nDiscord: Buh-bye, have a nice time! Everything is fine here. Bye bye... Bye bye...\n[door shuts]\nDiscord: You like carrots, Angel? I'm playing your owner for a fool! [laughs] How d'ya like them carrots?\nAngel: [screams]\nDiscord: [snaps fingers]\n\n[pages turning]\nTwilight Sparkle: That's weird. The spell I had in mind isn't in here. Spike, where are the other books I asked you to pull?\nSpike: Right here, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: I really want to have a reforming spell up and running pronto.\nSpike: But what if he makes the Elements of Harmony disappear like he did last time?\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Celestia cast a spell protecting them, remember? Uh-oh.\n[books thudding]\nSpike: What's wrong?\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Celestia didn't cast a spell protecting our books! Everywhere I thought I'd find the reforming spell... [gasps]\n\n[rumbling]\nDiscord: [eating] Are you sure this isn't overdoing it? You said to make myself at home while you were gone, but I wouldn't want to overstep my bounds.\nFluttershy: Nngh... I did say that, so... if this makes you more comfortable... by all means, please feel free.\nDiscord: Oh. Well, it does, very much so. You're so very kind, my dear Fluttershy. I always knew that you were the understanding one, not like those nasty friends of yours.\nAngel: [Wilhelm scream]\nFluttershy: [gasps] My friends aren't nasty!\nDiscord: Well, of course you'd say that. It just goes to show how understanding you truly are. You know, I think Princess Celestia is right when she singled you out as the one who could reform me. You're off to such a good start, I'm seriously considering actually being reformed. [under previous: blows raspberry]\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy! Fluttershy, can you hear me?\nFluttershy: Goodness! I hear Twilight!\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy, what's going on? Are you okay?!\nFluttershy: We're fine. Everything's going great. Isn't it, Angel?\nAngel: [chitters dizzily]\nTwilight Sparkle: We've come to get you away from Discord! He's just terrible and, from the looks of it, completely out of control!\nFluttershy: Oh, but you're wrong! We're making great progress!\nTwilight Sparkle and Spike: Seriously?!\nFluttershy: I'm earning his trust by giving him a little space to be himself.\nSpike: Hate to break it to ya, but he used that \"space to be himself\" to tear out all the reforming spells from the library!\nFluttershy: That does explain the paper eating...\nTwilight Sparkle: He ate them?! Ugggghhhh!\nFluttershy: But we aren't gonna need a spell. He's already really considering being reformed! He said so.\nTwilight Sparkle: And you believed him?\nFluttershy: If I'm going to be his friend, I have to start by giving him the benefit of the doubt! Tell you what. Bring all the ponies over for a dinner party this evening, and I'll bet his manners will have really improved by then. I'll even get him to put the cottage back on the ground first.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Alright. Dinner it is.\n\nRainbow Dash: Ugh, I can't believe we're having a dinner party with Discord!\nRarity: This evening is sure to be a disaster. Glad I didn't bother wearing my fanciest outfit.\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy thinks this is the way to reform Discord and asked us to give it a chance.\n[door opens]\nDiscord: Oh, our pony guests! [upper class voice] We're so delighted that you've come. Please, do come in.\nFluttershy: See what a beautiful job he did helping? Discord set the entire table himself. I'm so proud.\nDiscord: May I take your... [clears throat] hats, ladies?\nTwilight Sparkle: Hang on to your elements, girls. It's gonna be a bumpy night.\n\nFluttershy: As you all know, Princess Celestia hoped we'd help Discord use his magic for good instead of evil.\n[splat]\nFluttershy: Pinkie Pie, care for some gravy?\nPinkie Pie: You bet!\nDiscord: Allow me.\n[magic pop]\n[animate gravy boat panting like a dog]\nPinkie Pie: Oh, what a cute little gravy boat you are! Yes you are! Yes you are!\nRainbow Dash: That's one creepy little gravy boat if you ask me.\nFluttershy: Oh, come on now, Dashie. You're not even giving this a chance.\n[pouring]\nRainbow Dash: Hey! That's hot!\nDiscord: Whoops! [chuckles] I'm so sorry!\nRainbow Dash: He did that on purpose!\nDiscord: Oh, well, I don't know about that. Mistakes happen. Oh, look, everypony, dancing candles!\nRainbow Dash: I'm not falling for that! Discord's just trying to distract us from\u2013\n[poking noises]\nRainbow Dash: [grunts] Hey! Knock it off! I suppose that's another \"mistake\"?\nDiscord: No, I think you just made them mad.\nTwilight Sparkle: There's something fishy going on.\n[splashes]\nFluttershy: Discord?\nDiscord: Well, it's hardly my fault if the soup tureen finds the term \"something fishy\" to be offensive.\nRarity: Not the dress! Not the dress!\n[splashes]\nApplejack: That tureen's only doin' what you're makin' it do!\nFluttershy: Now let's not jump to any conclusions.\nRainbow Dash: Fluttershy! Can't you see what he's doing? He's playing innocent with you so you'll never agree to use the Elements of Harmony against him!\n[splash]\nDiscord: Oh, well, that's a bit harsh, isn't it?\nRainbow Dash: You see what I'm saying, right, Fluttershy? Fluttershy!\nFluttershy: You know what I see? I see that Discord's far from perfect, but I also see none of you giving him a chance!\nRest of main cast: [complaints]\nRainbow Dash: What's gotten into you?! Why do you keep cutting him so much slack?\nFluttershy: Because that's what friends do.\nDiscord: We're friends?\nFluttershy: Why, of course! I can't remember my house ever being this lively before you came along.\nDiscord: Oh... Well, I've... never really had a friend before.\nFluttershy: Well, now you do!\n[window opening]\nAngel: [worried chittering]\nFluttershy: Now is not a good time, Angel.

What do you think of your \"friend\" now, Fluttershy?\n\n[splashing]\nApplejack: I've never seen the floodin' this bad! They've built dams 'round here before, but never like this! What's goin' on?\n[beaver chittering]\nFluttershy: [gasps] Such language! [sighs] It's no use. They won't listen to a word I say!\nRainbow Dash: You see Discord's behind all this, right?\nFluttershy: Oh, of course I do! Do you all think I'm a silly, gullible fool?\n\n\n\n\nRarity:\nOnly in the sense\nof being silly and gullible...\n\n\nPinkie Pie:\nUm, well...\n\n\nApplejack:\nUh... uh, no, not exactly...\n\n\nRarity:\nOnly in the sense\nof being silly and gullible...\n\nPinkie Pie:\nUm, well...\n\nApplejack:\nUh... uh, no, not exactly...\n\nFluttershy: I've just been trying to gain his friendship any way I can, so he'd come to trust and listen to me!\nDiscord: Hey there, Fluttershy, you want a turn? The water's great!\nFluttershy: Time to see if it worked.\nDiscord: Fluttershy, oh, there you are. A sight for sore eyes.\nFluttershy: As you can see, there's a big mess down here at Sweet Apple Acres.\nDiscord: Oh, yes. Awful business, that. Mm.\nFluttershy: It is awful. This is Applejack's home, and it's being destroyed by innocent creatures who would never be acting this way if it weren't for your reckless behavior. You need to fix this.\nDiscord: Oh, yes, very well, I will fix it. I only ask one thing in return.\nFluttershy: Yes?\nDiscord: I ask that you never use your Element of Harmony against me. As a sign of our friendship.\n[necks squeaking]\nFluttershy: I will never use my Element of Harmony against you.\nDiscord: Excellent! [snaps fingers] There, much better! I do prefer ice skating to water skiing! Don't you? [humming]\n[nonexistent crowd cheering]\nFluttershy: Discord! That's not fixing it! Why, I oughta...\nDiscord: Where are you going? What's wrong, pal?\nFluttershy: Don't call me your pal!\nDiscord: Oh, pfft, come skating with me, and we'll let bygones be bygones.\nSpike: Here you go, Fluttershy! Game on!\nTwilight Sparkle: He fixes this or he goes back to being stone! Princess Celestia will understand!\n[suspenseful pause]\nFluttershy: I made a promise not to use my element against him, and I'm going to keep it.\nPinkie Pie: [gasps]\nApplejack and Rainbow Dash: [groans]\nDiscord: Hahah! You see? She wants to have fun with me because we're friends. She can't use the elements against me because we're friends. I'm free forever! [laughs]\nFluttershy: [growls] Not. Your. Friend!\nDiscord: Who cares? I can do whatever I want, whenever I want. I'm Discord, the master of chaos! You think you can boss Discord around? You think I'm just going to turn all this back because you say so? Because if I don't, I'll lose the one friend I ever had? [pause] Oh. Oh. Well played, Fluttershy. Well played.\n[magic noises]\nMain cast sans Fluttershy: [cheering]\nDiscord: I like it better my way, but... I guess when you're friends, you can't always have things exactly your way all the time, eh?\n\nDiscord: Yes, Princess, I'm ready to use my magic for good instead of evil. [under his breath] Most of the time.\nPrincess Celestia: Congratulations on your success, ponies. I definitely sense a big change in Discord. [to Twilight] I'll leave the Elements of Harmony with you, Twilight. Just in case.\nTwilight Sparkle: You were right when you said Fluttershy would be the one to find the way to reform Discord. By treating Discord as a friend, she got him to realize that friendship was actually important to him. And something that, once he had, he didn't want to lose.\nFluttershy: Go on. Say it...\nDiscord: [groans] Alright. [quickly] Friendship is magic.\nFluttershy: See?

Gonna\u2013 [gasps] What happened to all my jewels?! [drums claws] I had a bowl full of them here, and now I don't! Which means somebody took 'em!\nOwlowiscious: [hoots]\nSpike: Who? That's what I'm asking, who?! Who took my jewels?! Oh. I'm who. This cake was gonna be so good! Why? [thump] Why?! [gulps] Whyyyyyyyyy???!!!\nOwlowiscious: [hoots]\n\n[theme song]\n\nSpike: [singing] I have no jewels... I have no cake... I'm a sad little dragon... With nothing to\u2013\n[knock on door]\nOwlowiscious: [hoots]\nSpike: ...is it?\n[door opens]\nFluttershy: Oh! Oh goodness, I-I hope I'm not interrupting anything.\nSpike: Well... I do have this cake to not bake...\nFluttershy: Oh... sorry, it's a bad time.\nSpike: Uh, inside joke. Talk to me.\nFluttershy: It's just that... Princess Cadance needs us to do a great job welcoming the Head of the Equestria Games when she visits the Crystal Empire tomorrow\u2013\nSpike: Oh, I know all about that. As if I wouldn't be any help at welcoming...\nFluttershy: Oh, I don't know what was I thinking. Of course you might be upset for not being invited, and... here I am coming to ask you for a favor. You were probably going to say no anyway. All I had to offer you in exchange was one little jewel.\nSpike: What was that?\nFluttershy: [yelps] All I have is this jewel.\nSpike: [slurp] That's a really big one. A really big, juicy, perfect-for-a-cake-topper jewel.\nFluttershy: Does this mean you'll do it?\nSpike: Yeah... Sure...\nFluttershy: Oh, thank you, thank you! So while I'm gone, you'll take care of Angel, and tomorrow is Tuesday, which is his tail-fluffing day, and it's really important for him to look good.\nSpike: Wait, what? You want me to take care of him?\nAngel: [blows raspberry]\nFluttershy: Oh, well, yes. But if it's too much trouble, I can always see if there is somepony else.\nSpike: Uhh... We already agreed on the whole jewel thing, so I'll just...\nFluttershy: Thank you, thank you, thank you! Angel, aren't you just so excited?\nAngel: [distressed squeaking]\nFluttershy: See you tomorrow.\nAngel: [blows raspberry]\nSpike: You know... She's not the only pony with a pet that might need some watching...\n\n[gyrocopter spinning]\nSpike: All I'm saying is, if Fluttershy thought that her beloved little friend shouldn't be left alone while you're busy in the Crystal Empire, then maybe that's just something to think about.\n[gems clinking]\nRainbow Dash: Tch! Tank's not some fuzzy little bunny. He can take care of himself.\n[thwack]\n[thudding]\nRainbow Dash: He's a strong, fearless, and totally together pet.\n[crash]\n[apples rolling]\nRainbow Dash: [groans]\n[gyrocopter restarts]\n[crunch]\nSpike: [whistles innocently]\nRainbow Dash: Alright. You can watch him, but only because... uh... Tank's got a strict flying regimen, and-and someone needs to make sure that he doesn't slack off while I'm gone.\nTank: [licking]\nRarity: Ohh! [laughs]\nRainbow Dash: You know... the two of us are very diligent.\nSpike: Okay, whatever.\nRarity: Yes, yes, more importantly, as for Opal, she likes to eat every thirty six and a half minutes, you groom her with her silken brush, head to toe...\n[scribbling]\n\nRarity: ...Oh, and don't forget to pooch her pillow out in the middle, that's where she likes it. And the temperature in the room should always be exactly eighty one point four degrees. That's the only way she can get to sleep.\nOpalescence: [purring]\n[scribbling]\n[feather spontaneously combusting]\nRarity: And, um... hmm... oh, good, so thanks for your help and good luck to you.\nRainbow Dash: A-hem... I think the dragon was expecting a little something for his efforts.\n[gem sparkling]\nSpike: Almost as beautiful as the pony who gave it to me...\nRainbow Dash: Shouldn't you be critter-proofing the library or something? Tank has a tendency to\u2013\n[thud]\nOpalescence: [yowls]\n[crash]\nSpike: Critter-proofing. Yeah, I'll get right on that. [chuckles] Three down, three to go.\n\nSpike: What's that you said, Gummy? Uh-huh. Well, you're just gonna have to ask Pinkie Pie about that one.\n[sproing]\nPinkie Pie: Ask me, ask me!\nSpike: Go ahead, ask her!\n[boing]\nPinkie Pie: Of course you can have another cupcake! Mm? Mm-hm? Yeah? Why didn't you say so? I'll get you a bigger pond immediately.\nSpike: I think what Gummy's trying to say is\u2013\nPinkie Pie: He's always wanted a pair of riding pants? His toenails need a new coat of shellac? He wants to floss twice a day instead of just once? [giggles]\nSpike: I think what Gummy's trying to say is that he'd like a little Spike time.\nPinkie Pie: Who wouldn't?! Spike time is the best!\nSpike: Alas, it doesn't come cheap.\n\nRainbow Dash: All I'm saying is you might wanna think about a helmet. You only want to get hit in the head by a flying turtle... once.\nSpike: A thousand plus carats of pure deliciousness... [slurp]\nApplejack: Looks like you got a regular pet day care in here, Spike. You'll still be able to get some good play time with Winona like you said though, won't ya? She tends to get a little wild if she doesn't get her exercise.\nSpike: Exercise. Sure, of course.\nWinona: [barks]\nSpike: Whoa!\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't remember seeing critters on the invite list.\nApplejack: That's 'cause we're leavin' them here with Spike. He's gonna do a little critter-sittin' for us.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, really?\n[thunk]\nFluttershy: So sorry I'm late. Silly bunny had hidden his brush. Be sure you get plenty on his tail, or it won't get as poofy as he likes it.\nApplejack: Come on, girls, or we're gonna miss the train. One more for the road? Oh, you little puppy-wuppy, come on here! [chuckles]\nPinkie Pie: No, no no no. I love you more. No, I love you more! I love you more!!!\nFluttershy: Oh, I promise it'll be okay. I'll fluff your tail twice next week. Three times?\nRarity: Oh, I know. It's a chilly eighty one point two in here. Spike, take care of this, would you please?\nSpike: You got it! So, uhh... What are you thinking about that hooting little friend of yours? Suppose you want me to keep an eye on him too.\nTwilight Sparkle: That would be nice. You sure you don't already have your hands full?\nSpike: Nah, pshaw. I'll be fine. But, uh, just between you and me, I gotta give priority to the... paying customers.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sigh] You absolutely sure you can do this?\nSpike: Of course. Wouldn't have agreed to it if I couldn't. Piece of cake. Speaking of cake, I got a little something I need to attend to.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah, like keeping an eye on a house full of critters.\nSpike: [slurp] Uh, yeah, uh, that was totally what I was talking about. Relax. Go to your welcoming thing in the Crystal Empire. Spike's got it all under control.\n[door closes]\n[crashing, scraping]\nWinona: [barking]\n[thunk]\n\n[crashing]\nWinona: [barking]\nOpalescence: [yowling]\n[pages ripping]\n[scratching]\n[gyrocopter spinning]\n[crash]\nSpike: Alright, sidekicks, front and center!\nWinona: [barks]\nSpike: There are six of you, but there's only one right here in front of me... Gah! Two! And what I say goes!\nOwlowiscious: [hoots]\nSpike: Spike, the boss of you, that's who. One, two, three! Nngh, come on, number four!\nOpalescence: [yowls] [scratches]\nSpike: Whoa! Guh...\nGummy: [sucking]\n[squelch]\nSpike: One, two, three, four, five... Argh, who's missing?\n[zip]\nSpike: Angel.\n[thunk]\n\n[gyrocopter spinning]\nSpike: All I wanted were some jewels. Big, juicy, delicious jewels. Now what do I have? A missing rabbit and\u2013\nWinona: [barks] [sniffs]\nSweetie Belle: Awww, little fluffy Angel Bunny-kins! You're so cute! The natural weaves in his fluff are to die for!\nSpike: [clears throat]\nAngel: [thumping]\nSweetie Belle: Isn't Angel just the cutest thing you've ever seen?!\nAngel: [blows raspberry]\n[ding]\nSpike: [to Angel] Look, you don't wanna be with me. I'd rather not chase you around all over the place when I could be enjoying some jewel cake. Watch me solve both of our problems. [to the Cutie Mark Crusaders] Y'know, I'm supposed to be watching him, but you all have just hit it off so well that maybe, maybe I could let you take care of him instead.\nApple Bloom: We would, but we've got some major Crusaders business planned for today!\nScootaloo: Major. We're getting our skydiving cutie marks today!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Ha! Yeah!\nSpike: Well, I suppose, if you've got other plans... It's just, you're so good with them. Like get-a-cutie-mark-for-bunny-sitting good?\nApple Bloom: A bunny-sittin' cutie mark...\nSweetie Belle: That would be adorable!\nScootaloo: He does seem to like us.\nApple Bloom: And we haven't exactly figured out how we're gonna pull off this whole skydivin' thing.\nSpike: You know what? As hard as it's gonna be for me to part with these little guys, I think you should probably just take all of them. If you ask me, nngh, the more critters you take care of, the more chances you have of getting some kind of critter-sitting cutie mark. Am I right or am I right?\nApple Bloom: Sure!\n[door shuts]\nSpike: Yes!\nApple Bloom: But wait! How're we gonna take good care of them without treats for when they're good?\nSweetie Belle: And we'll need beds for when they're tired!\nScootaloo: And toys! They need toys!\nSpike: It's an afternoon. They don't need all that stuff. They'll be fine.\nApple Bloom: We need to be able to buy them some things! One jewel might be able to cover it all.\nSpike: Uh... what would I possibly be doing with jewels?\nApple Bloom: I happen to know for a fact that Applejack gave you a gem to watch Winona, which means...\nSpike: Obviously, no one around here is getting a cutie mark for kindness toward a poor, hungry little dragon. Take it or leave it.\nApple Bloom: We'll take it.\n[zip]\n[door shuts]\n\nSpike: [singing] Gonna put in some flour, and add a little sugar for my five de-li-cious jewels!\nSweetie Belle: [distant] But pink feathers would look so good with your eyes!\nSpike: Meh... that bird could use a little color.\nScootaloo: [distant] Has anyone seen Tank's head? Where's his head?!\n[door opens]\nSpike: What have you done to the turtle?!\n[pop]\nScootaloo: Ohh, I totally forgot he could do that. Heh.\nApple Bloom: Yeah, so, pretty sure critter-sittin' cutie marks are out.\nSweetie Belle: And our critter-grooming cutie marks probably aren't going to appear anytime soon either.\nOwlowiscious: [hoots]\nSpike: [groans] Alright, load 'em up. And you can gimme back that jewel I gave you.\nApple Bloom: Sorry, we don't have it anymore.\nSpike: What? Why not?!\nScootaloo: How do you think we paid for the industrial-sized pet hair dryer?\n[dryer blowing]\nSpike: [groans] Oh.\n\nWinona: [barks]\nOpalescence: [yowls]\n[crash]\nAngel: [laughs]\nZecora: Zecora knows just what to do about all this bad mojo that's floating around you.\nSpike: I'm thinking a cage and a great big lock might be next.\nZecora: Zecora can take the bad away if you do just what I say.\nSpike: Really?\nZecora: But before I can do my duty, I am going to need some of your booty.\nSpike: [sighs] Where are you going?\nZecora: You think jewels are what you need, but there's no worse mojo than dragon greed.\nAngel: [laughs]\nSpike: [stomach growling]\n[pets fighting]\n\nSpike: Almost there...\nGranny Smith: [suspiciously] Mm-hm...\nSpike: Just taking good care of everyone's animals. What am I gonna have to do to get this to go away? [sighs] And this is just between you and me, right? No other pony has to hear a word about it?\n[pets fighting]\nGranny Smith: A word about what now?\nSpike: This better be important.\n[steam hissing]\nConductor: All aboard!\nSpike: Angel.\nConductor: I can't have all of these animals on my train. Not without tickets and not without chaperones.\nSpike: All I need is to get on for one minute, grab a bunny, and get off! Promise!\nConductor: [laughs] Likely story. No chaperone, no train.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [laughing]\nScootaloo: Skydiving cutie marks!\n[splash]\nSpike: Is three ponies enough? [sighs] At least I have you two left, my delectable little treasures.\nConductor: All aboard for the Crystal Empire!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Crystal Empire?!\nScootaloo: I've always wanted to see the Crystal Empire!\nSweetie Belle: I wish I were dressed for it, but still... [squealing] THE CRYSTAL EMPIRE!\nSpike: We're not really going! We just needed to get on the train so I can get that rabbit! And when I do, we're off!\nScootaloo: What?!\nApple Bloom: That's not fair!\nAngel: [blows raspberry]\nSpike: There he is!\nConductor: Next stop, the Crystal Empire!\nSpike: No, no, no, no, no, no!\n\n[train engine chugging]\nApple Bloom: So it seems like the Crystal Empire would be really cold, but I've heard that it's not! It's as warm as can be!\nScootaloo: Do you think the walls are crystal? [gasps] Maybe even see-through! Can you imagine see-through walls?\n[door opens]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [gasping]\n[crash, crunch]\nOpalesence: [yowls]\nSpike: Take it! Just take it!\n\n[train engine chugging]\nScootaloo: So beautiful!\nSpike: Well, enjoy it while you can, 'cause we're not getting out of this car until we're back in Ponyville!\nApple Bloom: There is no way, no how, we're comin' all the way to the Crystal Empire without lookin' around!\nSpike: Nopony's gonna get past this dragon!\nApple Bloom: Don't make me use this!\nSpike: You wouldn't dare! [giggles]\n[crunch]\nSpike: Oh no! [gasps]\nScootaloo: Whoa, just whoa.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [giggling]\nSweetie Belle: Ah! I'm in crystal heaven!\nSpike: Shhh! They're right there! There's the bunny! Please, please, pretty please, don't go down there! I'll fluff your tail! I'll perm, highlight, and blow it out if you'll just stop!\nAngel: [blows raspberry]\nSpike: What do you want?! Name it, and it's yours! [pants] [groans] [kisses] Hyah!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [gasping]\nAngel: [crying]\n[click]\n[luggage clattering]\nFluttershy: Oh my goodness.\nConductor: All aboard!\nSpike: Hah! You're coming with me!\nAngel: [crying]\n\nSpike: We made it!\nSweetie Belle: Without seeing the palace!\nTwilight Sparkle: I think this car's empty.\nSpike: They're coming this way! Everybody down!\nSweetie Belle: There has to be a better solution!\nSpike: Shh! Oh, don't sit down, don't sit down!\nApplejack: Whooeee! My dogs are barkin'.\nWinona: [barks]\nApplejack: Did y'all hear that? They really are!\nRainbow Dash: Huh, bummer Spike had to miss out on all this. He woulda' had fun here.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sure he's having a great time watching all the critters back at home.\nApplejack: Think he's still got a handle on things?\nTwilight Sparkle: If he's staying calm and collected, I bet he's doing a terrific job as a leader.\nSpike: Go ahead, bunny. Do your worst. I deserve it. I ignored you, tried to pawn you off on someone else, I didn't take these silly things out, or fluff this like I was supposed to. I wasn't really thinking about you at all. Any of you. Just wanted the jewels. I hope you'll all forgive me someday.\nWinona: [licks]\nSpike: You will? [stomach growls] Oh great. I'm gonna be the one who gives us away.\n[clink]\nSpike: Where did you\u2013 [stomach growls]\nApplejack: You all hear that?\n[patting]\n\n[train braking]\nApplejack: I can't wait to scratch the belly on Winona. Oh, I miss her.\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't wait to see Owlowiscious! [giggles]\nSpike: Hello! Thought we'd meet you at the station!\nSweetie Belle: So we could hear all about the Crystal Empire, and find out if you brought us one of the crystal snow globes that they sell at the train station!\nRarity: How did you know about the snow globes?\nSweetie Belle: Um... lucky guess?\nTwilight Sparkle: I've gotta hand it to you, Spike. You did a really good job of taking care of the animals.\n[gyrocopter spinning]\nFluttershy: Oh, Spike, Angel looks perfect! You did such a good job fluffing his tail.\nSpike: Yeah, well... we're like this now.\nOwlowiscious: [hoots]\nSpike: You know who.\n\nOwlowiscious: [hoots]\nTwilight Sparkle: So what are you thinking? Bake 'em into a jewel pie? Ooh, six-layer gem cake sounds pretty good!\nSpike: Yeah, it does. [slurps] It really, really does. Whyyyyyyyyy???!!!\nWinona: [howls]\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[train puffing]\nTwilight Sparkle: You absolutely sure you can do this?\nSpike: Of course. Wouldn't have agreed to it if I couldn't. Piece of cake.

We can't miss our train!\nConductor: Tickets.\nApplejack: Oh, this is gonna be a real treat. Princess Cadance said she'd never seen the Crystal Ponies so excited.\nRainbow Dash: Duh! Of course they're excited. They're up for the Equestria Games. It's only the biggest sporting event in all of Equestria.\nRarity: Didn't Cloudsdale host the Equestria Games one year?\nRainbow Dash: No. Cloudsdale should have hosted the games one year. I'll never forget when we got the bad news.\n\nLaurette: The Equestria Games go to... the city of Fillydelphia.\nYoung Rainbow Dash: NOOOOOOOOOOO!\n\nRainbow Dash: These Crystal Ponies lost a thousand years to an evil king's curse. They've had enough bad news. No way we're letting them experience the pain of losing out on these games.\nTwilight Sparkle: Exactly. Princess Cadance is counting on us to do our part to convince the Games Inspector to choose the Crystal Empire. And we are not gonna let her down. Are we?\nPinkie Pie: NOOOOOOOOOOO! What? I was just answering Twilight's question.\n\n[theme song]\n\n[train whistle]\nMain cast: Four, three, two, one! The Crystal Empire, that's the one!\nPinkie Pie: [through megaphone] Okay, everypony, great job! Sounds like we're ready.\nMain cast sans Twilight: [cheers, etc.]\nTwilight Sparkle: One more time from the top.\nRest of main cast: [groans]\nRarity: Oh, please! I think that was perfect.\nApplejack: [sighs] But we've run this, like, twelve times already. I think we've got it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Cadance said the Games Inspector really puts folks through the wringer on her visits. There's no margin for error here. And this time we need to practice the steps.\nApplejack: On a train car?\nRainbow Dash: You heard the pony! On your hooves!\nMain Cast: Two, four, six, eight\u2013 [screams]\n[brakes squealing]\n[crash]\nTrain Conductor: Crystal Empire, ladies! Watch your step leaving the train!\nRarity: [groans]\nApplejack: [sighs] Probably should've watched our step while we were still on it, too.\n\n[train chugging]\nPinkie Pie: Wow! The Crystal Empire looks crystallier than ever!\nApplejack: They must have everypony in the Empire out sprucing it up!\nTwilight Sparkle: This must be why we were asked to handle the welcome committee routine.\nRainbow Dash: And it's probably also because we'll be awesome at it.\nApplejack: Princess Cadance was right. These ponies do look pretty darn excited.\nRainbow Dash: Yup, I remember that feeling. But not as much as I remember the crushing wave of disappointment that came when things didn't work out. That right there. That is the face I do not want to see.\nRest of main cast: [mutters of agreement]\n\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: We're here.\nPrincess Cadance: [giggles] There are my girls.\nTwilight and Cadance: Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake!\nRarity: [gasp]\nTwilight and Cadance: Clap your hooves and do a little shake! [giggling]\nRarity: Oh, my. This is spectacular. Please, everypony, stand back! I need air!\nPrincess Cadance: Go ahead and try whatever you like. It's all complimentary for the welcome committee.\nRarity: Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!\nPrincess Cadance: That over there is a crystal mud bath, which relaxes your body and rejuvenates your coat. Now, I realize it can be kind of strange to climb into mud, but if you'll just give it a chance, I'm sure\u2013\nPinkie Pie: Woo-hoo!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie, no!\nPinkie Pie: [laughing] Ahh, so relaxing!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie! Honestly!\nPrincess Cadance: [breathes in]\nTwilight Sparkle: [breathes in]\nPrincess Cadance: [breathes out]\nTwilight Sparkle: [breathes out]\nPrincess Cadance: Go ahead, have a good time while I get my ceremonial headdress done.\nRarity: Ceremonial... headdress?\nPrincess Cadance: When meeting with important guests, it was tradition for rulers of the Crystal Empire to weave crystals into their manes in a very specific way. The Games Inspector is known for doing her homework. She'll certainly be expecting my look to reflect the importance of her visit.\n[door opens]\nGolden Hooves: Princess, if I may have a word... I-I have two pieces of news for you. First, your mane stylist has the flu and won't be able to make it for fear of you catching it, too.\nPrincess Cadance: Oh. Well... I hope she's better soon. Do any of the other stylists here know how to do the traditional royal ceremonial headdress?\nCrystal Ponies: Um... well... uh... (No.)\nPrincess Cadance: Oh. [breaths in] [breaths out] Just a... small detail.\nRainbow Dash: Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're trying to land the Equestria Games here. There is no such thing as a small detail!\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash!\nRarity: I suppose... I could give it a shot.\nPrincess Cadance: Oh, Rarity, you would do that for me?\nRainbow Dash: Way to step it up, Rare!\nPrincess Cadance: Fortunately, I have all the precise instructions right here.\n[paper unfurling]\nRarity: Oh, my!\nPrincess Cadance: You sure you're up to this?\nRarity: Working on the hair of royalty on such an auspicious occasion is the opportunity of a lifetime! I will give it everything I've got!\nTwilight Sparkle: See? No worries!\nRarity: Besides, the Games Inspector isn't expected for several hours. I'll have plenty of time to figure out exactly how to... do... this...\nPrincess Cadance: Oh, Rarity, that's wonderful! [to Golden Hooves] You said you had a second bit of news?\nGolden Hooves: Yes, quite. The Games Inspector, Ms. Harshwhinny, will be arriving on the... next train.\nAll: [gasp]\nRainbow Dash: What!? You couldn't have told her that news first!? That's fifteen minutes from now!\nFluttershy: Oh, my goodness!\nRainbow Dash: [panicked breathing]\nTwilight Sparkle: [breathes in] [breathes out] How long before Cadance is ready?\nRarity: Hmmmm... I'm sure to find some shortcuts.\nTwilight Sparkle: Can you have her back at the castle when we're done?\nRarity: Done.\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, we'll be fine. Everypony, just be on the look out for the pony with the flower print luggage.\nPinkie Pie: Easy peasy, pudding in the freezy!\nTwilight Sparkle: We bring the Games Inspector back to the castle, put on our big welcome committee how-do-you-do and then...\nPinkie Pie: Put the pudding out to thaw before you eat it or you'll crack a tooth?\nRainbow Dash: I'll just ignore that. We need to remember that the Games Inspector arriving early is probably part of a plan to psych us out.\nTwilight Sparkle: What do you mean?\nRainbow Dash: You said it yourself. She's got a rep for trying to catch hosts off-guard, just to see if we can handle the kind of massive pressure that comes with hosting the Equestria Games.\nFluttershy: Oh, no... We're gonna blow it...\nRainbow Dash: Not if we always stay one step ahead and don't fall for any of her mind games. Anything she throws at us, we just need to remember she's testing us and roll with it.\n\n[train braking]\nRainbow Dash: Excuse me, ma'am?\nMs. Peachbottom: Yes, what is it?\nFluttershy: Oh, no!\nTwilight Sparkle: Be cool. [to Ms. Peachbottom] Well, I know you're not expecting us, but we're here to personally welcome you to the Crystal Empire.\nMs. Peachbottom: The whole lot of you came to do that?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, well, um... yes!\nMs. Peachbottom: Well, darn tootin', ain't that the cat's meow! Y'all didn't need to do that. Why, I hardly expected anything like this.\nApplejack: Whew! The Princess wouldn't have had it any other way.\nMs. Peachbottom: The Princess? Princess Cadance?\nTwilight Sparkle: None other!\nMs. Peachbottom: Well, tie me up and throw me down! This just keeps gettin' better and better!\nFluttershy: Can we help you with your bags?\nMs. Peachbottom: Don't mind if ya do!\nFluttershy: Ooh, I love flower print! Sorry.\nPinkie Pie: Our first stop is the castle, where we got a big razzamatazzy welcome planned for you!\nMs. Peachbottom: The castle? Are you kidding?! Hot-diggety-dawg!\nTwilight Sparkle: See that? We just gotta roll with it until the Princess gets there and we'll be just fine.\n[train chugging]\n\n[drilling noise]\n[stretching noise]\nPrincess Cadance: So, uh... how's it going so far?\nRarity: Oh, I'm so sorry... It's just... oh so complicated. [laughs nervously] I can fix it!\nPrincess Cadance: Fix what?!\nRarity: Well, I-I was looking for shortcuts and I thought step twelve was optional! But it's not!\n\nMs. Peachbottom: My golly, the crystal castle! [gasps] Why, I've seen pictures, but I never expected to see it with my very own eyes! [gulps] From the inside...\nFluttershy: Oh, my gosh, she's so nice!\nRainbow Dash: You're letting her lull you into a false sense of confidence. Watch that. It's all part of the game.\n[twang]\nMs. Peachbottom: Oh, my, I'm so excited.\nTwilight Sparkle: Please, have a seat, won't you?\nMs. Peachbottom: Mind if I take a quick run outside first? It was an awfully long train ride and my legs could use a stretch.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, well... we were just about to start.\nMs. Peachbottom: Oh! Never you mind. You go on ahead. I'm listening.\nRainbow Dash: She was probably testing us to see if we could remain in control of a complex situation. Looks like we passed. Bump\u2013\nFluttershy: \u2013cha!\nTwilight Sparkle: We'd like to thank you for this opportunity to introduce you to this wonderful kingdom!\nMs. Peachbottom: Oh, why, the pleasure is all mine.\nTwilight Sparkle: And since we're not even from here ourselves, who better than us to let you know just how welcoming this place can be!\nMain cast:\nTwo, four, six, eight!\nName a place that's really great!\nOne, two, three, four!\nKeeps you coming back for more!\nTwo, seven, nine, three!\nThe place that we all wanna be!\nFour, three, two, one!\nThe Crystal Empire, that's the one!\nMs. Peachbottom: Oooh, yeah! [whistles]\nMain cast: [panting]\nMs. Peachbottom: Ooh, I tell ya! I have traveled far and wide, but I have never, ever been welcomed anyplace in the fashion that y'all have done here today.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's fantastic! Princess Cadance would be so glad to hear that!\nMs. Peachbottom: Honestly, I'm surprised she knows anything about me at all!\n[pause]\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course she does! She's been looking forward to your visit for weeks!\nMs. Peachbottom: Oh, goody! Is she here?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh...\nApplejack: [hushed] Where the heck is she anyway? Wasn't she supposed to be here by now?\nMs. Peachbottom: Oh, that's all right. [gulps] Maybe I-I-I'll just take my little run outside now. [panting]\nRainbow Dash: Or, if you like, we could give you a tour of the castle! That way you could be learning and stretching all at the same time!\nMs. Peachbottom: Ooh, a tour of the crystal castle... I'd love that a whole heap.\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] Dash! We've hardly ever even been here before!\nRainbow Dash: [hushed] It's just another test! We gotta roll with it, remember?\nPinkie Pie: Oooh! Lemme give the tour! I'lldoit, I'lldoit, letmeletmeletme!\nTwilight Sparkle: [breathes in] [breathes out] Fine. You all start giving her the tour, and I'll go see what's keeping Cadance.\n[luggage dragging]\nMs. Harshwhinny: Oof!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hello there!\nMs. Harshwhinny: Hello yourself. First hello of the day\u2013\n[splash]\nMs. Harshwhinny: Oof! [groans]\n\nTwo, four, six, eight!\nName a place that's really great!\nOne, two, three, four!\nKeeps you coming back for more!\nTwo, seven, nine, three!\nThe place that we all wanna be!\nFour, three, two, one!\nThe Crystal Empire, that's the one!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [humming]\nRarity: [gasps] W-What are you doing here?\nTwilight Sparkle: We finished the welcome committee song and we just wanted to introduce Ms. Harshwhinny to\u2013\nRarity: No, no! Princess Cadance isn't ready. Something's gone terribly wrong!\nTwilight Sparkle: I need to speak to the Princess.\nRarity: You can't! You mustn't! She's in the middle of a delicate conditioning rinse that must go perfectly if there's to be any hope for her hair!\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on, how bad can it be?\nRarity: Imagine her mane turned into a porcupine.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ew.\nRarity: Please! I will bring her back from the brink of tragedy, but you have got to buy me some time! There's no other way!\n[door slams]\n\nPinkie Pie: So, you see this here? This, um, this is, um... a big, round room. It's known for its roundness and bigness. And did I mention that it's round?\nMs. Peachbottom: I think they call it a rotunda? A small, confining, rotunda...\nPinkie Pie: [blows raspberry] Whatever. Round is round, am I right?\nApplejack: [hushed] Easy, Pinkie, let's play this safe! We got her in a good mood, so let's not do anything to ruin that.\nMs. Peachbottom: You know... I love this sort of architecture. I-I-I detect a neo-Gothic inspiration in the design, yes?\nPinkie Pie: Hey! Look at me! [makes funny noises]\nApplejack: [sighs] And not a moment too soon. Where's Cadance? Please tell me she's right behind you.\nTwilight Sparkle: There's a bit of a problem with her headdress. How's it going here?\nPinkie Pie: Boingy, boingy, boingy! [wibbles tongue]\nMs. Peachbottom: I, uh, hate to be a bother, but the legs are cramping up on me with all this standing around...\nRainbow Dash: Huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: She's getting bored, and we have to buy Rarity some more time. [breathes in] [breathes out] I'll see if Shining Armor can come help. Can't one of you other ponies take over in the meantime?\nRainbow Dash: I got this. Wanna stretch your legs, huh? Well, whatever you need, I'm sure we can provide. Let's just make our way to the castle's gymnasium. Our tour will now be headed... this way. And we're walking, and we're walking...\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [humming]\n[door opens]\nAthletes: [indistinct conversations]\nShining Armor: Twily!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hello there! Shining Armor, you've gotta help me.\nShining Armor: [blows whistle] Everything okay?\nTwilight Sparkle: I left the other ponies behind giving the Games Inspector the worst castle tour ever.\nShining Armor: Come on, gang! Are we gonna gallop, or are we gonna trot!? [to Twilight] Castle tour, huh? I'm pretty sure I can give you a hoof with that. [to athletes] Let's move, move, move! [to Twilight] Everything's gonna be okay.\nTwilight Sparkle: I know, I'm not worried. I'm not worried... it worked!\nMs. Peachbottom: [gasping] I'm outside! [laughing] Feels so good to stretch the old legs!\nShining Armor: Uh, what the\u2013\nRainbow Dash: Turns out the crystal castle doesn't have a gymnasium.\nShining Armor: Watch it!\n[crash]\nMs. Peachbottom: Woo-hoo!\nShining Armor: Make her stop!\nRainbow Dash: Wait, that's the Games Inspector! Let her do her thing.\nMs. Peachbottom: Good. Oh, these hooves! I'm outside!\nShining Armor: Why would she do that?\nRainbow Dash: I have no idea, but that's why she's who's in charge of choosing who gets the Games, and we're not.\n[crashing]\n[skidding]\nMs. Peachbottom: [muffled] Oh! Oh, get me outside for a run!\nShining Armor: Look out!\n[crash]\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, okay, we need to stop her.\n\nMs. Peachbottom: [muffled, hysterical yelps]\n[splash]\nFluttershy: Where's she going in such a hurry?\nMs. Peachbottom: [muffled, hysterical yelps]\nRainbow Dash: Closer... closer... I think we've got her... Yaaaaaaah!\n[thud]\n[glass squeaking]\nMs. Peachbottom: Hoo-eee! Oh, that felt good! Nothing like a great run to shake the cobwebs off these old bones.\nRainbow Dash: [panting]\nMs. Peachbottom: Hey there, speedy. Ah, these wide open spaces y'all got here remind me of home. This is great!\nRainbow Dash: Oh! [pants] So you're [pants] enjoying your visit? [pants] Well, I'm so [pants] glad! [pants]\nMs. Peachbottom: Oh, good golly, yes. I just love to travel and see new places. Such a beautiful spot you got here, too!\nShining Armor: Why... thank you so much! I'm Shining Armor.\nMs. Peachbottom: [gasps] The Prince!\nTwilight Sparkle: What's going on?\nRainbow Dash: From the looks of it, just locking up the games for the Crystal Empire is all. Ain't no thing.\nMs. Peachbottom: My, oh, my... I never met a Prince before...\nShining Armor: [chuckles] I'm surprised. I'd think in your line of work you'd meet princes all the time.\nMs. Peachbottom: Hardly. Just an ordinary wild mustang from Mustangia here to enjoy a little vay-cay. Never thought I'd also be meeting royalty to boot. [giggles]\nTwilight Sparkle: You... are Ms. Harshwhinny, the Equestria Games Inspector, aren't you?\nMs. Peachbottom: Inspector what-now?\nRainbow Dash: We got the wrong pony?!\nPinkie Pie: NOOOOOOOOOOO! I mean, YEEEEEEESSSSSSSS!\nTwilight Sparkle: [panicked breathing]\n\nApplejack: Oh, please still be here... Oh please, oh please, oh please...\nTwilight Sparkle: There's got to be another pony with flower print luggage around here somewhere.\nRainbow Dash: Except that there isn't!\nTwilight Sparkle: We've gotta find her before Cadance finds out what a mess we've made of things.\nRainbow Dash: Okay, here's what we do. We split the Empire up into five sectors.\nFluttershy: Each of us search a sector.\nPinkie Pie: Well... except for the spa. What's the point of checking there? That's where Cadance is. If Ms. Harshwhinny is there, well, then, game over, right?\nRest of main cast: [gasp]\n\nMs. Harshwhinny: Every city and empire wants to host the Equestria Games. So, I have to go through all the big phony-baloney song and dance, though of course, I'm never getting the real inside scoop.\nMs. Peachbottom: Oh, golly, I've been having a swell time since I got here. I'm actually thinking of extendin' my stay.\nMs. Harshwhinny: And what exactly has made your visit so special?\nMs. Peachbottom: Oohohohoooh, gosh, where to start?\nRainbow Dash: Oh, there she is! We're in luck! I don't think either of them knows yet that the other one's here!\n[bell rings]\nRarity: Wonderful news, look! Princess Cadance, better than new!\nMs. Harshwhinny: Princess Cadance? So, this is where you've been! I will have you know this is by far the worst welcome I've had in all my years!\nPrincess Cadance: I-I can't believe it... What was wrong with your welcome?\nMs. Harshwhinny: There wasn't one!\nPrincess Cadance: What is going on?\nRainbow Dash: Princess, we gave our welcome to the wrong pony, left the right one waiting at the station, and completely ruined everything.\nPinkie Pie: [nervously] Cinnamon bun? [squee]\nRainbow Dash: When I was a little filly, I wanted so badly for Cloudsdale to win the Equestria Games. But it didn't happen. So I thought I could make up for that disappointment by helping the Crystal Empire win the chance to host the Games. But it looks like I ruined your chances instead.\nMs. Peachbottom: Not so fast, speedy.\nMs. Harshwhinny: I just finished hearing about how this pony was just treated to the warmest, finest, most fabulous reception she ever had.\nMs. Peachbottom: Darn tootin'!\nMs. Harshwhinny: Courtesy of these fine ponies right here. Which, in my expert opinion, amounts to the first ever unvarnished, unrehearsed, and unbiased appraisal of a potential host of the Equestria Games. Which can only mean one thing...\n\nPrincess Cadance: [through microphone] The next host of the Equestria Games is... the Crystal Empire!\n[cheering]\nRainbow Dash: We did it!\nPrincess Cadance: [through microphone] Congratulations, Crystal Ponies!\n[boom]\n\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] You know, it feels good to help others get something you always wanted but never had. Almost as good as getting it yourself. Almost.\nTwilight Sparkle: We'll still be able to come back here and watch the games when they're played.\nRainbow Dash: You're right. That'll rock!\n[luggage collapsing]\nFluttershy: Oh, my goodness.\nConductor: All aboard!\nRainbow Dash: Huh, bummer Spike had to miss out on all this. He woulda' had fun here.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sure he's having a great time watching all the critters back at home.\nApplejack: Think he's still got a handle on things?\nTwilight Sparkle: [breathes out] If he's staying calm and collected, I bet he's doing a terrific job as a leader.\n[stomach growl]\nApplejack: You all hear that?\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n\n[Twilight Sparkle]\nMorning in Ponyville shimmers\nMorning in Ponyville shines\nAnd I know for absolute certain\nThat everything is certainly fine\n\nMorning in Ponyville shimmers\nMorning in Ponyville shines\nAnd I know for absolute certain\nThat everything is certainly fine\n\nThere's the Mayor en route to her office\nThere's the sofa clerk selling some quills\n\nThere's the Mayor en route to her office\nThere's the sofa clerk selling some quills\n\nDavenport: Morning, kid!\n\n[Twilight Sparkle]\nMy Ponyville is so gentle and still\nCan things ever go wrong?\nI don't think that they will\n\nMy Ponyville is so gentle and still\nCan things ever go wrong?\nI don't think that they will\n\nMorning in Ponyville shimmers\nMorning in Ponyville shines\nAnd I know for absolute certain\nThat everything is certainly\u2014\n\nMorning in Ponyville shimmers\nMorning in Ponyville shines\nAnd I know for absolute certain\nThat everything is certainly\u2014\n\n[splash]\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash, that's not funny!\nRarity: Terribly sorry, darling.

What happened to your cutie mark?\nRarity: Whatever do you mean, Twilight? I'm simply doing what I've done since the day it first appeared. Does my sky look fabulous or what?\n[ponies complaining]\nRarity: Too last season?\nTwilight Sparkle: Where is Rainbow Dash? Why isn't she handling this?\n\nSpike: [yawns] I still don't know what you had to wake me up for. I love sleeping in the rain.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's not about the weather, Spike. Rarity had Rainbow Dash's cutie mark and said this was Rainbow Dash's cottage. Something strange is going on... [knocks]\n[animal noises]\nRainbow Dash: Hey, guys.\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash! Why is Rarity doing your job?\n[crash]\nTwilight Sparkle: And what in Equestria is going on in... here?\n\n[Rainbow Dash]\nThese animals don't listen, no, not one little bit\nThey run around out of control and throw their hissy fits\n[cat hissing]\nIt's up to me to stop them, 'cause plainly you can see\nIt's got to be my destiny, and it's what my cutie mark is telling me\n\nThese animals don't listen, no, not one little bit\nThey run around out of control and throw their hissy fits\n[cat hissing]\nIt's up to me to stop them, 'cause plainly you can see\nIt's got to be my destiny, and it's what my cutie mark is telling me\n\n[Fluttershy]\n[blows balloon]\nI try to keep them laughing, put a smile upon their face\nBut no matter what I try, it seems a bit of a disgrace\n[blows party horn]\n[laughter]\nI have to entertain them, it's there for all to see\nIt's got to be my destiny, and it's what my cutie mark is telling me\n\n[blows balloon]\nI try to keep them laughing, put a smile upon their face\nBut no matter what I try, it seems a bit of a disgrace\n[blows party horn]\n[laughter]\nI have to entertain them, it's there for all to see\nIt's got to be my destiny, and it's what my cutie mark is telling me\n\n[Pinkie Pie]\nI don't care much for pickin' fruit and plowin' fields ain't such a hoot\nNo matter what I try, I cannot fix this busted water chute!\nI've got so many chores to do, it's no fun being me\nBut it has to be my destiny, 'cause it's what my cutie mark is telling me\n\nI don't care much for pickin' fruit and plowin' fields ain't such a hoot\nNo matter what I try, I cannot fix this busted water chute!\nI've got so many chores to do, it's no fun being me\nBut it has to be my destiny, 'cause it's what my cutie mark is telling me\n\n[Applejack]\nLookie here at what I made, I think that it's a dress\nI know it doesn't look like much, I'm under some distress\nCould y'all give me a hand here and help me fix this mess?\nMy destiny is not pretty, but it's what my cutie mark is tellin' me\n\nLookie here at what I made, I think that it's a dress\nI know it doesn't look like much, I'm under some distress\nCould y'all give me a hand here and help me fix this mess?\nMy destiny is not pretty, but it's what my cutie mark is tellin' me\n\n[Rarity]\nI'm in love with weather patterns, but the others have concerns\nFor I just gave them frostbite over top of their sunburns\nI have to keep on trying, for everyone can see\n\nI'm in love with weather patterns, but the others have concerns\nFor I just gave them frostbite over top of their sunburns\nI have to keep on trying, for everyone can see\n\n[Rarity and Rainbow Dash]\nIt's got to be\n\nIt's got to be\n\n[Fluttershy]\nIt's got to be\n\nIt's got to be\n\n[Pinkie Pie]\nMy destiny\n\nMy destiny\n\n[Applejack]\nMy destiny\n\nMy destiny\n\n[Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy]\nAnd it's what my cutie mark\n\nAnd it's what my cutie mark\n\n[Pinkie Pie and Applejack]\nIt's what my cutie mark\n\nIt's what my cutie mark\n\n[Rarity, Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Applejack]\nYes, it's what my cutie mark is telling me!\n\nYes, it's what my cutie mark is telling me!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: This is bad. This is very, very bad.\nSpike: What's going on? Why is this happening?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Last night when you were taking one of your seven-hour bubble baths, I got a special delivery from the princess.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Dear Twilight Sparkle,\nThe spell contained on the last page of this book is Star Swirl the Bearded's secret unfinished masterpiece. [gasps] Ooh! He was never able to get it right, and thus abandoned it. I believe you are the only pony who can understand and rewrite it. Princess Celestia\nFrom one to another, another to one. A mark of one's destiny singled out alone, fulfilled. That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't even rhyme!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I cast the spell so I could find out what it was, but nothing seemed to happen. But now I know something did happen. The spell has changed the Elements of Harmony! That must be why their cutie marks are all wrong!\nSpike: So just cast a counter-spell to switch them back.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. There is no counter-spell!\nSpike: Why don't you just use that memory spell you used to fix everypony when Discord was here?\nTwilight Sparkle: It's not their memories, Spike. It's their true selves that have been altered!\nSpike: Zecora's cure for the cutie pox?\nTwilight Sparkle: That won't work either...\nSpike: Well [sighs], maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe our friends will grow to like their new lives.\nTwilight Sparkle: No, Spike. They're not who they are meant to be anymore. Their destinies are now changed, and it's all my fault.\n\n\n[Twilight Sparkle]\nI have to find a way\nTo make this all okay\nI can't believe this small mistake\nCould've caused so much heartache\n\nI have to find a way\nTo make this all okay\nI can't believe this small mistake\nCould've caused so much heartache\n\nOh why, oh why?\n\nOh why, oh why?\n\nLosing promise\nI don't know what to do\nSeeking answers\nI fear I won't get through to you\n\nLosing promise\nI don't know what to do\nSeeking answers\nI fear I won't get through to you\n\nOh why, oh why?\n\nOh why, oh why?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Spike, what have I done?\n\nSpike: Aw, come on, Twilight, you'll figure out a way to fix this. These are your friends.\nTwilight Sparkle: You're right, Spike. And they mean more to me than anything. My friends...\nSpike: Twilight? Are you alright?\nTwilight Sparkle: I've got it! I know what to do!\nSpike: You do?\nTwilight Sparkle: I may not be able to remind them of who they are, but I can show them what they mean to each other. They'll find the part of themselves that's been lost so they can help the friend they care about so much! Come on, Spike!\n\n[bits clinking]\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy, wait!\nFluttershy: Oh... Hey, Twilight...\nTwilight Sparkle: Where are you going?\nFluttershy: I'm moving back to Cloudsdale. I don't know what's wrong, but I can't seem to make anypony laugh.\n[whoopee cushion deflating]\nTwilight Sparkle: Before you go, I was wondering if you might be willing to help Rainbow Dash. She's really struggling with her animals.\nFluttershy: But... I don't really know anything about animals...\nTwilight Sparkle: But you do know something about Rainbow Dash.\nFluttershy: I... know that she's a true friend, and I'll do anything I can to help her.\n\n[thunk]\nRainbow Dash: [muffled] Whoa!\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash!\nRainbow Dash: I'm in here! Help! I'm trapped!\nFluttershy: Hurry, Twilight! Can't you do some sort of spell to get her out?\nTwilight Sparkle: No. Fluttershy, you're the only one who can help! Rainbow Dash needs you!\nFluttershy: Um... Hello? Little... woodland creatures? I know that you're all very upset and feel like giving Rainbow Dash a hard time, but we'd all really appreciate it if you'd calm down and, um, maybe... rest for a bit? Oh! Uh... look! Here's some nice, juicy leaves for you to munch on. And some crunchy, munchy acorns too. Uh, wouldn't you like to take a break and have a little snack?\n[cutlery clinking]\n[animals eating]\nFluttershy: Aww, look at that. I guess you were all just cranky because you were hungry. Oh, you are very welcome, little friends.\nBear: [kisses]\nFluttershy: Goodness, it's like I can understand them! I...

Something even a great unicorn like Star Swirl the Bearded was not able to do, because he did not understand friendship like you do. The lessons you've learned here in Ponyville have taught you well. You have proven that you're ready, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ready?

I'll still be here to help and guide you, but we're all your students now, too. You are an inspiration to us all, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: But... what do I do now? Is there a book about being a princess I should read?\nPrincess Celestia: [giggles] There will be time for all of that later.\n\nPrincess Celestia: We are gathered here today in celebration of a momentous occasion. My most faithful student, Twilight Sparkle, has done many extraordinary things since she's lived in Ponyville. She even helped reunite me with my sister, Princess Luna. But today, Twilight Sparkle did something extraordinary. She created new magic, proving without a doubt that she is ready to be crowned Equestria's newest princess.

Um... [clears throat] A little while ago, my teacher and mentor Princess Celestia sent me to live in Ponyville. She sent me to study friendship, which is something I didn't really care much about. But now, on a day like today, I can honestly say I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the friendships I've made with all of you. Each one of you taught me something about friendship, and for that, I will always be grateful. Today, I consider myself the luckiest pony in Equestria. Thank you, friends. Thank you, everypony!\n[crowd cheering]\nShining Armor: Twilight! I'm so proud of you!\nTwilight Sparkle: Are you crying?\nShining Armor: Of course not. It's... it's liquid pride. Totally different thing.\nShining Armor and Twilight Sparkle: [laughing]\nApplejack: Way to go, Princess!\nPinkie Pie: Best coronation day ever!\nFluttershy: We love you, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: I love you too, girls!\n\n\n[Twilight Sparkle]\nLife in Equestria shimmers\nLife in Equestria shines\nAnd I know for absolute certain\n\nLife in Equestria shimmers\nLife in Equestria shines\nAnd I know for absolute certain\n\n[Main cast and crowd]\nThat everything (that everything)\nYes, everything (yes, everything)\nYes, everything is certainly fine\nIt\u2019s fine\n\nThat everything (that everything)\nYes, everything (yes, everything)\nYes, everything is certainly fine\nIt\u2019s fine\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes!

Oof!\nApplejack: Lookin' good up there, Princess Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack, you know you don't have to call me that.\nRarity: Why do you protest so? You've already given up wearing your crown all the time. The least you can do is embrace your new title.\nTwilight Sparkle: If other ponies want to address me that way, I suppose it's fine, but... not my friends. It just doesn't feel right. [sigh] And neither does all this flying business. The Summer Sun Celebration is only two days away, and I'm never gonna be ready to perform my part.\nRainbow Dash: Not if you spend all your time down here, you won't! Now get up there and show everypony the big finish!\nMain cast sans Twilight: [cheering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Woo-hoo! Whaaaa! Oof! Oof! [coughs] [screams]\nPinkie Pie: Wow! That was a big finish!\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\n\n[theme song]\n\nRarity: You look amazing, darling. They've really captured your regality.\nTwilight Sparkle: I suppose.\nRarity: Oh, don't be so modest. It's everypony's dream to someday wear a crown and have their coronation ceremony preserved in stained glass for all to see. [sighs]\nRainbow Dash: I don't know if it's everypony's dream.\nPinkie Pie: Most of my dreams are about frosting! [slurp] Ohohohoho...\nFluttershy: We'd better get going. We don't want to miss our train.\nApplejack: Fluttershy's right. Don't know about y'all, but I've still got bushels to do to get ready. The official celebration may be here in Canterlot, but hoo-wee, has the Mayor put us in charge of one heck of a party back home. Aw, don't look like that, sugarcube. You get to be right there with the other Princesses when Celestia raises the sun.\nTwilight Sparkle: And I'm honored. Really, I am. It's just that the Summer Sun Celebration is what first brought us all together. It just doesn't feel right not getting to spend such a special day with my Ponyville friends.\nRarity: It doesn't feel right to us either, darling. If the Mayor wasn't so desperate for our assistance, we'd most certainly stay here in Canterlot. And of course we do understand that your royal duties must come first.\nApplejack: The Summer Sun Celebration may have brought us together, but it's something much bigger that'll always keep us connected. Exhibit A: The six of us are united by the Elements of Harmony. No amount of royal duties is gonna change that. Right, everypony?\nFluttershy, Rainbow Dash and Rarity: [general agreement]\nApplejack: Right, Pinkie Pie?\nPinkie Pie: Creamy, creamy frosting... [chuckles]\nFluttershy: You should take that as a yes.\n\n[train whistle blows]\nPinkie Pie: We're gonna write you and give you so many details, it'll be like you're in Ponyville with us! Right, girls?\nApplejack, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash and Rarity: Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.\nRarity: And you will be with us right after the Celebration. We already have an appointment on the books to discuss the royal upgrades to your loft decor.\n[train whistle blows]\nTrain Conductor: All aboard for Ponyville!\nMain cast sans Twilight: [giggling]\nPinkie Pie: Whee!\n[train chugging]\nTwilight Sparkle: [exhales] I can't help it, Spike. They've only been gone a minute, and I already feel like I'm missing something.\nMessenger Pony: For the Princess.\nSpike: [reading] Dear Twilight, you aren't missing anything. Your friend, Pinkie Pie.\nPinkie Pie: [in the distance] That's me!\nMain cast sans Twilight: [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: But I am. I just know it.\n\nSpike: Check, check, check, check, and... check! Huh, whaddaya know? We're way ahead of schedule! I credit your extremely competent assistant.\nTwilight Sparkle: So do I.\nSpike: The Celebration isn't until the day after tomorrow. We could still fit in a quick trip to Ponyville and be back in plenty of time to finish off these last few things before the main event!\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] That would be nice, Spike, but what if something else came up while we were gone? What if we were delayed getting back and I wasn't able to finish everything on that list? What if we lost the list on the way to Ponyville and then couldn't remember which things we'd done and which things we hadn't done, and then spent so much time trying to figure out what we hadn't done and what we had done, and we ruined the entire Celebration by not doing the one really important thing that we were supposed to do?!\n[thud]\nSpike: Uh... so that's a 'no' then?\nTwilight Sparkle: These are the first royal duties Princess Celestia has given me. I can't risk letting her down!\nPrincess Celestia: And I'm sure you won't.\nSpike: Your highness!\nPrincess Celestia: No need for that now, Princess Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry.\nPrincess Celestia: [giggles] No need to apologize.\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry!\nPrincess Celestia: I must admit that it is wonderful to actually be looking forward to the Summer Sun Celebration.\nTwilight Sparkle: What do you mean?\nPrincess Celestia: For my subjects, it has always been a celebration of my defeat of Nightmare Moon. But for me... [sighs] It was just a terrible reminder that I'd had to banish my own sister.\nTwilight Sparkle: I guess I never really thought about it that way.\nPrincess Celestia: But now it has become a wonderful reminder of her transformation back into Princess Luna, and our happy reunion. I am so pleased that you will be playing a role in the festivities. I know it must have been difficult to see your friends return to Ponyville without you.\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe a little.\nPrincess Celestia: You may no longer be my student, Princess Twilight, but I hope you know that I will always be here if you need me. Just as I hope that you will always be there when I need you.\nSpike: [clears throat] I think this guy needs you?\nMessenger Pony: Uh, a message for Princess Twilight.\n[party popper going off]\nPrincess Celestia: A letter from Ponyville, I presume?\nTwilight Sparkle: Never mind. It's not important. Spike, where were we?\nSpike: About to call it a night?\nTwilight Sparkle: We should probably go over the checklist one more time.\nSpike: I knew you were gonna say that...\nPrincess Celestia: I'll leave you to it.\n\nPrincess Celestia: [gasps] [yelps]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh?! Spike?\nSpike: [snores] Check-check-check-check-check-check...\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike!\nSpike: Ungh... What time is it?\nTwilight Sparkle: It's the middle of the night! But it could be morning. That's just it! I can't tell!\nSpike: Whoa. That is weird.\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on, Spike, we have to find out what's going on.\n\n[ponies chattering]\nS01E26 Unnamed Unicorn Mare #1: What do you think it means?!\nRoyal Ribbon: Princess Twilight will know!\n[ponies chattering]\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm-I'm sure it's just... Well, there's certainly a logical ex\u2013\nRoyal guard #1: Your Highness, you must come with us.\n[doors slam]\nRoyal guard #1: It's Princess Luna and Princess Celestia.\nRoyal guard #2: They're gone!\nTwilight Sparkle and Spike: [gasp]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: But I don't understand! Where are they?\nRoyal guard #1: We don't know. It seems that Princess Celestia and Princess Luna have simply... vanished.\nSpike: Vanished?!\n[thud]\nRoyal guard #1: This is why we have come to you.\nRoyal guard #2: We await your command.\nTwilight Sparkle: My command?!\nRoyal guard #2: We're officers of the Royal Guard. We take our orders from royalty. With Princess Luna and Princess Celestia gone, and Princess Cadance overseeing the Crystal Empire now, that means we take our orders from you.\n[thud]\nRoyal guard #2: Princess Twilight, there's no time to waste. We need to know what you want us to do.\nTwilight Sparkle: I want you to continue the search for Princess Luna and Princess Celestia. We have to find them before ponies start to panic. There must be some clue that can tell us what's happened to them. If you find something, anything, let me know immediately. [exhales]\nSpike: Way to take charge, Twilight.\n[doors slam]\nRoyal guard #3: Your highness! News from Ponyville! The Everfree Forest appears to be... well... invading!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\n[thud]\n\n[animals chattering]\nFluttershy: Excuse me... Oh, pardon me... Are you all right? My goodness, what is it that has caused you all such distress?\nBear: [grunts]\nFluttershy: Whatever it is, I'm sure it's nothing you need to really worry about. [screams] Oh, no, you were right. You should be worried! Very, very worried!\n\nGranny Smith: [grunting]\n[snap]\nApplejack: Come on, y'all! Put your backs into it! [grunts]\n[stretching noises]\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup. [chomp] Nope. Eeyup. [chomp] Nope. Eeyup. [chomp]\n[thud]\nBig McIntosh: ...Nope.\nApplejack: [straining] Dagnabbit, we ain't never seen this kind of trouble with weeds before. Now that I think about it, I've never seen these kinds of weeds at all! Have y'all?\nBig McIntosh: Nope.\nApplejack: Where the heck are these things comin' from? And what in tarnation is goin' on with the sky?!\n\nRainbow Dash: Oh, no, you don't! This is Ponyville territory, and we aren't due for rain until after the Summer Sun Celebration. You Everfree clouds need to just head on back to where you belong! Whoa! [yelps] Gonna make me do this the hard way, huh? [yelping] Hey!\n\nRarity: [humming] Hmm. Something strange about the sky.\n[tea trickling]\n[splash]\nRarity: What in the name of calming chamomile is going on?!\nOpalescence: [yowls]\nRarity: Opalescence, darling, I'm so sorry! I promise I am not doing this on purpose!\n[hiss]\n[smashing crockery]\nRarity: It wasn't me, I swear!\nOpalescence: [growls]\nRarity: Ooh, Sweetie Belle! If this is some sort of prank you and your little Crusader friends are pulling, I find very little humor in it!\nSweetie Belle: Rarity, you have to help me! I think something's wrong with my horn!\n[thud]\nSweetie Belle: [grunts] [yelps]\nRarity: [gasps]\nSweetie Belle: [screams]\nRarity: [yelps]\n\nSpike: Where are we going?!\nTwilight Sparkle: The Everfree Forest is... 'invading'. Whatever is going on, I'm sure we're going to need our friends and the Elements of Harmony to stop it! I just hope we haven't missed the train...\nSpike: [gasps] [short on breath] Twilight? There is another way for us to get to Ponyville, remember?\nTwilight Sparkle: There is?\nSpike: Huah! You can fly!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. Right!\n[car engine starting and sputtering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Whoa!\n\n[Wilhelm scream, other ponies scream]\nRarity: Something very strange is going on, and- [gasps] I for one would appreciate an explanation!\nRainbow Dash: All I know is the sky's split in two, and these clouds moving in sure aren't from around here.\nApplejack: Neither are all these crazy plants! They're comin' from the Everfree Forest! And try as we might, us Earth ponies can't do anythin' to get rid of 'em! Don't suppose you know any magic that might stop 'em from spreadin'?\nRarity: Alas, this whole raging forest situation seems to have left my horn on the fritz!\nFluttershy: We have to figure out something! I don't know how much more of this Ponyville can take! [yelps] I don't know how much more I can take!\nApplejack: The forest is expandin', y'all, and judgin' by how fast it's movin', it doesn't seem content just takin' over Ponyville... I reckon before long, it'll cover half of Equestria!\n[plants creaking]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [unsure noises]\nSpike: [gags]\n[click]\nSpike: I'm starting to wish... we'd taken the train!\nTwilight Sparkle: Almost there! Come on, Spike, we need to get the Elements of Harmony and find the others!\nSpike: Incoming!\nTwilight Sparkle: Whoa! Aah!\n[thonk]\nRarity: Oh, thank goodness!\nFluttershy: Oh, I hope you know we wouldn't normally go through your books without permission...\n[door opens]\nSpike: Sweet ground! [kissing noises] Sweet, sweet, wonderful ground!\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, I get it! I need to work on my flying!\nPinkie Pie: I dunno if you've noticed, but the Everfree Forest is just a teeny-tiny bit out of control.\nRarity: [groans]\nApplejack: Guess it turned out you were missin' something here in Ponyville after all.\nRarity: But perhaps you already know what's causing all of this calamity. Has Princess Celestia sent you to dispel it posthaste?\nTwilight Sparkle: Not exactly. You see, Princess Celestia is, well... she and Princess Luna are both...\nSpike: They're missing!\nRest of main cast: [gasps]\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know who has taken them, but I've got a hunch we're going to need the Elements of Harmony to get them back.\nRainbow Dash: Oh, yeah, just like old times.\nPinkie Pie: A-boo-yah!\nApplejack: I told ya we'd always be connected by the Elements. [sighs] Now we just gotta figure out who to aim these bad boys at so we can get Celestia and Luna back and keep the rest of Equestria from becoming plant food! Any ideas?\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmm...\nPinkie Pie: I haven't found squat in any of the books I've been looking through! Oopsies! Missed a spot!\n[scribbling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Half day, half night... strange weather patterns... out of control plants. I think I'm starting to get a pretty good idea of who we're up against.\n\n[magical whirling noises]\nDiscord: [singing] Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap-ooh! [laughs] Now, Twilight, you know Princess Celestia said that you were to give me a heads up before you summon me with that little spell she gave you. In case you haven't noticed, I was in the middle of a particularly invigorating shower.\nTwilight Sparkle: E-nough! Release Princess Celestia and Princess Luna, and stop the Everfree Forest from invading!\nDiscord: Why, [chuckles] whatever are you talking about?\nApplejack: Don't you play dumb with us, Discord! We know you're the one behind all of this!\nDiscord: Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love what you've done with the place, but I couldn't possibly take responsibility. I'm reformed, don't you remember?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, right! This has got your cloven hoofprints all over it!\nDiscord: I'll have you know that I have only one cloven hoof. Such accusations. And here I thought we were friends.\nPinkie Pie: Drop the act, buster! We're onto you!\nDiscord: Ladies, ladies, I'm innocent. Would I lie to you?\nMain cast sans Fluttershy: Yes!\nFluttershy: Um, maybe?\nDiscord: Well then, it seems we've reached an impasse. I'm telling the truth, but you think I'm lying. What do friends like us do in a situation like this, Princess Twilight? Congrats, by the way, on the promotion. You totally deserve it.\nRainbow Dash: I say we blast him back to stone!\nApplejack: Works for me!\nRarity: Hear, hear!\nFluttershy: Hey! We can't do that! What if he really is telling the truth?\nDiscord: Well, finally! Somepony willing to give me the benefit of the doubt. The rest of you could learn a lot about friendship from my dear friend Shutterfly here.\nFluttershy: Um, it's Fluttershy.\nDiscord: Oh, right, whatever.\nTwilight Sparkle: If you're not the one responsible, then help us figure out who is!\nDiscord: I suppose I could, but after all the hoof pointing and besmirching of my good name, I just don't know if I'm up to it.\n[knitting needles clacking]\nTwilight Sparkle: Rrrgh!\nDiscord: Why don't you ask your zebra friend if she knows anything?\nTwilight Sparkle: Zecora!\nZecora: From my home, I have had to flee! The forest has grown too wild, even for me!\nApplejack: Any idea why all this is happenin'?\nZecora: I'm afraid it is a mystery to me as well, but I may have something that, if combined with a spell... I do not dare to use it myself, the results would be tragic. It only responds to Alicorn magic. Princess Twilight, you can turn the potion from purple to white.

I am sorry, but you have given me no choice but to use these.\n[rumbling and clanking]\nTwilight Sparkle: Are those the Elements of Harmony? But that's how they looked in... the past. This is the night you banished her.\nNightmare Moon: Nooooooo!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Why are you all looking at me like that?\nApplejack: It's just... you were mumblin' to yourself...\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! And don't forget the uncontrollable sobbing!\nFluttershy: We were really worried about you.\nDiscord: I for one found it delightful. Sort of a one-pony theater piece, if you will. You should really consider taking it on the road.\nRainbow Dash: Did you find out whose rump we need to kick and where we can find them?\nTwilight Sparkle: I saw something from a long time ago. But it didn't explain what's happening now.\nZecora: Perhaps farther back still are the answers you seek. Another sip of the potion will give you a peek.\nSpike: You sure about this?\nTwilight Sparkle: [gulping]\nDiscord: Oh, I do hope she breaks into a song this time!\n\nDiscord: Oh, this is so much fun. How about a game of 'Pin the Tail on the Pony'?\nPrincess Celestia: [gasp] Play time is over for you, Discord.\nDiscord: Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? Suit yourselves. Oh! What have you got there?\nPrincess Celestia: The Elements of Harmony.\nPrincess Luna: With them, we shall defeat you.\nTwilight Sparkle: This must be when they turned Discord into stone.\nDiscord: [laughing] You should see yourselves right now. The expressions on your face. So intense. So sure of yourselves. [laughing] Hilarious!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp]\nPrincess Luna: [gasp] The Tree of Harmony.\nTwilight Sparkle: The Tree of Harmony? My cutie mark.\nPrincess Luna: Are you sure?\nPrincess Celestia: We have managed to discover the only means by which we can defeat Discord and free the citizens of Equestria. Even without these elements, the Tree of Harmony will possess a powerful magic. As long as that magic remains, it will continue to control and contain all that grows here.\n\nSpike: So what did you find out?\nTwilight Sparkle: I still don't know what's happened to Princess Luna and Princess Celestia, but I think I know why the Everfree Forest is acting this way. Something's happened to the Tree of Harmony.\nRainbow Dash: The tree of what now?\nTwilight Sparkle: It's where Princess Celestia and Princess Luna found the Elements. I think it's in danger.\nApplejack: Well, all right then! Let's go save a... tree. Uh... where is it exactly?\nTwilight Sparkle: I think it's in... there.\nDiscord: Ooh-hoo! I'm going to need more popcorn!\n\nRarity: Seems like only yesterday we were heading into these woods to find the Elements of Harmony.\nTwilight Sparkle: Seems like only yesterday I was foolish enough to think I should go after them on my own. I don't know what we're going to face in there. But whatever it is, I know we need to face it together.\nAll: [agreeing]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: We can use those to cross. [yelps]\nRarity: [gasps] A cragadile! Run for your lives!\nCragadile: [roars]\nMain 6 sans Twilight: [grunting]\nTwilight Sparkle: That was close.\nApplejack: [sighs] A little too close, if you ask me. You sure you're all right?\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm fine. I just can't seem to get these new wings to do what I want them to do when I want them to do it.\nRainbow Dash: Aw, you'll figure it out eventually.\nTwilight Sparkle: \"Eventually\" isn't soon enough.\nApplejack: You have been having an awful lot of trouble with those things. And, well, who knows what else is gonna to come after us? You know, maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea for Twilight to go back to Ponyville and let us look for the Tree of Harmony without her.\nTwilight Sparkle: What? Why?\nApplejack: For starters, you just about got eaten by a cragadilly.\nTwilight Sparkle: We all did. He wasn't after just me.\nApplejack: Sure, but... well, the rest of us aren't princesses.\nTwilight Sparkle: What's that got to do with anything?\nApplejack: Princess Celestia and Princess Luna are gone. If something happened to you, I-I just don't think Equestria can risk losing another princess.\nRarity: Applejack does make a valid point. Even if we manage to save the Tree of Harmony, it won't necessarily mean Princess Celestia and Princess Luna will return. Equestria will need somepony to lead in their absence.\nTwilight Sparkle: But the Tree of Harmony! I'm the only one who has seen it and knows what it looks like.\nRainbow Dash: Huge tree, cutie marks on the trunk, probably being attacked by something hideously awful? Yeah, I'm pretty sure we'll know it when we see it.\nTwilight Sparkle: All of you feel this way? Feel like I shouldn't be here?\nFluttershy: It is probably for the best.\n\nDiscord: [humming]\nCherry Berry and Comet Tail: Help! Help!\nTwilight Sparkle: Discord!\nDiscord: You're welcome! Hmph. No luck finding your tree?\nTwilight Sparkle: We ran into some trouble. And my friends decided it would be best if I returned to Ponyville while they continue the search. Equestria will need me if Princess Celestia and Princess Luna don't return.\nDiscord: I'm just surprised that you agreed to their plan. I never thought you'd be the kind of pony who would think she was better than everypony else.\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't think I'm better than anypony!\nDiscord: Oh, well, how silly of me to assume that you would think that. All you did was choose to keep your precious princess self out of harm's way while your friends thrust themselves right into it. I'm sure you'll all be the best of pals again when they return from their terrifying yet deeply bonding experience that they're having without you. [chuckles]\nTwilight Sparkle: I never should have agreed to come back here.\nSpike: Come on, Twilight. Discord may be reformed, but he's not that reformed. He's just trying to get under your skin.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, it's working!\n\nRainbow Dash: Anypony else starting to think this is a lost cause? We're almost at Celestia and Luna's old castle. Maybe whatever Twilight saw when she took that crazy potion wasn't real. Maybe there is no Tree of Harmony. Maybe\u2013\nApplejack: Maybe it's right down there.\nRainbow Dash: [gasp] It can't be!\nRarity: How are we supposed to get to it?\nPinkie Pie: Whoa! Oof! Ugh! Take the stairs, silly!\n\nSpike: Are we there yet?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know where we are. We're lost. I never should have left my friends.\nSpike: We can't just give up. Maybe if I get up there, I'll be able to spot 'em. Well, what do you know? Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: [coughing]\nSpike: [gasp]\n\nFluttershy: [gasp] I think it's dying!\nApplejack: So let's save it already! [grunting]\nRainbow Dash: Nice try. Heh- Whoa! Oof!\nRarity: Valiant efforts on both your parts, but the tree remains in jeopardy.\nApplejack: And I suppose you've got a better idea? That's what I thought.\nFluttershy: I know who would know what to do. But we sent her home.\n\nRainbow Dash: It was your idea, Applejack!\nApplejack: We all agreed it was the best thing, Rainbow Dash! We were tryin' to protect her.\nSpike: Oof! Ow! Ugh!\n[whinny]\nSpike: Twilight! Trouble! Help!\n\nPlant Crab: [screech]\nApplejack: Listen here, you rabid rhododendrons! You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!\nPinkie Pie: [blows party horn]\nPlant Crab: [screech]\nRainbow Dash: Up here!\nPinkie Pie: Yoo-hoo! Come and get me!\nRarity: Don't forget about me!\nPinkie Pie: Ta-da!\nPlant Crab: [roar]\nApplejack: I sure am glad you came looking for us.\nTwilight Sparkle: Not as glad as I am that you found me.\nRarity: The truth of it is, Twilight, we're simply lost without you.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah. Equestria may need its princess...\nFluttershy: ... But we need our friend.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp] [yelps]\nPrincess Celestia: [voice over] Even without these elements, the Tree of Harmony will possess a powerful magic. As long as that magic remains, it will continue to control and contain all that grows here.\nTwilight Sparkle: I know how we can save the tree. We have to give it the Elements of Harmony.\nRainbow Dash: Whoa, whoa, whoa, heh. How are we supposed to protect Equestria?\nRarity: How are we meant to rein Discord in if we can't use the Elements to turn him back to stone?\nApplejack: Twilight... The Elements of Harmony... They're what keep us connected no matter what.\nTwilight Sparkle: You're right about one thing, Applejack. The Elements of Harmony did bring us together. But it isn't the Elements that will keep us connected. It's our friendship. And it's more important and more powerful than any magic. My new role in Equestria may mean I have to take on new responsibilities, and our friendships may be tested, but it will never, ever be broken. There's no time to lose. Everypony ready?\nAll except Twilight: Ready! [gasp]\n[whirring]\nDiscord: [thud] Oh, poo.\nPrincess Celestia: We know how difficult it must have been for you to give up the Elements. It took great courage to relinquish them.\nTwilight Sparkle: What's inside it? How am I supposed to open it?\nPrincess Luna: Six locks, six keys.\nPrincess Celestia: I do not know where they are. But I do know that it is a mystery you will not be solving alone.\n\n[party horn]\nDiscord: Bravo, ladies, bravo! How ever did you save the day this time? Blast the beastie with your magic necklaces, I presume? Where are those little trinkets of yours? You know, the ones you use to send me back to my extremely uncomfortable stone prison?\nApplejack: [sigh] Gone.\nDiscord: Gone? Gone?\nFluttershy: But our friendship remains. And if you want to remain friends, you'll stop thinking whatever it is you're thinking and help us clean up.\nDiscord: Fine. But I don't do windows.\nApplejack: One thing I don't get. Why did all this happen now?\nDiscord: I have no idea. Those seeds I planted should have sprouted up ages ago.\nTwilight Sparkle: What did you say?!\nDiscord: Oh, why should I try to explain it when you can see for yourself?\nTwilight Sparkle: [gulping]\n\nPrincess Celestia: Play time is over for you, Discord!\nDiscord: Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? [voice over] Well, obviously things didn't go according to my original plan. My plunderseeds should have stolen the magic from the Tree of Harmony and captured Princess Celestia and Princess Luna thousands of moons ago. Alas, it seems the tree had enough magic to keep the seeds from growing up big and strong. Until now, that is.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: You realize this is information we could have used hours ago?!\nDiscord: And rob you of a valuable lesson about being princess? What kind of friend do you think I am?\n[snap]\n\n[trumpet fanfare]\nPrincess Celestia: Citizens of Equestria, it is no longer with a heavy heart but with great joy that I raise the summer sun. For this celebration now represents not the defeat of Nightmare Moon, but the return of my sister, Princess Luna.\n[ponies cheering]\n\n[music]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nTwilight Sparkle: [groan]\n[whap]\nSpike: What's wrong, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh, I've gone through every book in Ponyville, Spike, and there isn't a single mention of the mysterious chest that came from the Tree of Harmony, nor anything about keys to unlock it! But something tells me that opening it is pretty important. I hope Princess Celestia has some ideas. If the library in Canterlot doesn't have anything, I-I don't know where else to look!\nSpike: [yelp] [belch]\nTwilight Sparkle: [reading] My dearest Twilight, while it would be perfectly lovely to have you in Canterlot once more, I have another option in mind much closer to Ponyville.\n\nPrincess Celestia: [voice over] As you know, the ancient castle that I once shared with Princess Luna lies mostly in ruins, deep in the Everfree Forest. But if you look carefully, you may find a book that could prove helpful to your research, hidden somewhere in what's left of the castle library.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp] Wow! Look at all these ancient books! It's a veritable goldmine of information! I can't believe it! Woo-hoo!\nSpike: Whoa, whoa-whoa! Oof! [yelp] Uh, heh-heh. So, uh, Twilight. Uh, ready to head home?\nTwilight Sparkle: Are you kidding? This place is perfect!\nSpike: [teeth chattering]\n[spiders scuttling]\n\n[theme song]\n\n[bees buzzing]\nRainbow Dash: I'm not gonna move. You move.\nApplejack: Uh-uh. There is no way I'm movin'.\nPinkie Pie: This is the most daring dare anypony ever dared dare another pony to dare!\nRainbow Dash and Applejack: Huh?\nPinkie Pie: It's exciting!\n[pop]\n[bee buzzing]\nParcel Post: Uh, whatcha'll doing?\nPinkie Pie: Rainbow Dash and Applejack are competing for the title of \"Most Daring Pony\"! This is the final test: the Bee Stare! Last pony to blink wins!\nParcel Post: ... I'm gonna need my bees back.\nRainbow Dash: But then we'll never find out who the Most Daring Pony is!\nParcel Post: Eh, sorry about that. [whistles]\n[buzzing stops]\nApplejack: Well, what do we do now?\nPinkie Pie: Don't worry, ladies, I've been keeping excellent score all day! [quietly] Hmm, move the decimal, carry the 2, and... [aloud] Congratulations! You're tied!\nApplejack: Tied?\nRainbow Dash: You can't be tied for the Most Daring Pony!\nPinkie Pie: I dunno! Numbers don't lie! I'd love to stay and keep keeping score, but I promised to help test the new school bell. I get to ring it all week, nonstop! And I don't even have to take turns, because no one else volunteered! [giggles]\nRainbow Dash: Okay, no problem. We just have to come up with another daring dare.\nApplejack: Right. I think I might have an idea of what we can do.\n\nFluttershy: Um, Rarity? Don't you think it's a little late in the day to be walking through the forest? It is... star-spider season, after all. Though, I'm sure you have a very good reason.\nRarity: Simply the most important reason I've ever had in my entire life!\nFluttershy: Oh, well then I'm happy to help. What is it?\nRarity: I've heard rumors that the Castle of the Two Sisters is filled with the most gorgeous of ancient tapestries in all of pony history! It pains me to think of those magnificent creations rotting away in those old ruins, totally unappreciated.\nFluttershy: I see...\nRarity: I require your help in borrowing one or two to bring back to the boutique where I can restore them. Maybe I'll even use the patterns as the inspiration for a new line!\nFluttershy: That does sound... very important.\nRarity: Yes, well, [clears throat] maybe not the most important thing in my entire life, but retro-ancient classical will be all the rage next season, so it's nothing to sneeze at. [sneezes]\nFluttershy: Um, are you sure you need those tapestries?\nRarity: But, of course. Although, I must admit these ruins are a fright. Just look at all the dirt everywhere! Ugh...\nFluttershy: [gasp] Angel!\n\nRarity: Goodness! It's practically an artistic treasure trove of ancient good taste! [sigh]\nFluttershy: Angel! Oh, you really shouldn't have run off like that. Ancient ruins are filled with all sorts of things that can hurt you! You could stub your toe, or, or trip on a loose stone... You have to be careful!\nSpike: I don't think I'll need all these candles, Twilight. I was really only scared for a second.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, these aren't for you, Spike. We're gonna be studying late into the night, and we're gonna need all the light we can get.\nSpike: Oh, great.\nApplejack: Well, here we are!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, what's so daring about this place? This is where we got the Elements of Harmony.\nApplejack: When I was just a filly, Granny Smith told me of an ancient legend. When Nightmare Moon was banished, not every last bit of her dark magic went with her. Granny used to say, when night falls on the castle, that magic takes the form of... the Pony of Shadows!\nRainbow Dash: You mean, like a ghost?\nApplejack: [spookily] Nopony knows!\nRainbow Dash: Ugh.\n\nRarity: [excited gasp] This one is perfect!\nFluttershy: Well, it certainly could use some restoration.\nRarity: Be a dear, fly up there and lift it off that hook?\nFluttershy: [grunts]\nRarity: [calling out] Maybe from below?\n[clattering and shuffling]\n\nRainbow Dash: I don't see what's so daring about an old legend. Plus, I don't believe in ghosts.\nApplejack: You might wanna rethink your position on that.\nFluttershy: [scared yelling]\nRainbow Dash and Applejack: [yelling] [screaming]\n\nRainbow Dash and Applejack: [screaming]\nApplejack: You saw that, right?\nRainbow Dash: Run!\n[clattering and shuffling]\nFluttershy: Ow... I think I hurt my wing.\nRarity: Oh, my dear, I am so sorry! That tapestry is far too heavy. We'll just have to find a smaller one.\nFluttershy: Oh, of course.\nRarity: Where, pray tell, did you disappear to?\nFluttershy: What do you mean?\nRarity: While you were struggling under that fabric, the entire wall spun around! You must have activated a secret door.\nFluttershy: Oh, I'm sorry.\nRarity: I suppose these ruins are chock full of them.\nFluttershy: Really?\nRarity: Absolutely. We must use the utmost care as we\u2014\nFluttershy and Rarity: [yelp]\n[clunk]\n\nRainbow Dash: [panting] Okay, so, maybe the legend is true!\nApplejack: Well, that's why I brought you here! I guess only the most daring pony of all could stay in this castle all night without being scared off.\n[screech]\nRainbow Dash: Scared? I'm not scared!\nApplejack: Well, m-me neither!\nRainbow Dash: Then it's settled! Whoever stays in the castle the longest is the Most Daring Pony.\nApplejack: Deal.\n[clop]\nRainbow Dash: But it's gonna take a lot more than some shadowy ghost pony to get me to leave.\nApplejack: Me too! Humph!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Find anything, Spike?\nSpike: Uh, nope. Nothing yet.\n[boing]\nSpike: Aaah!\nTwilight Sparkle: Angel? What are you doing here?\n[whoosh, clatter]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasp] Whoa! [reading] The Journal of the Two Sisters. [gasp] Maybe this is the book Princess Celestia was talking about!\n\nRainbow Dash: I sure hope you're not afraid of the dark, Applejack!\nApplejack: I can't say that I am! But even if I was, I'd be at least fifty percent less scared of it than you, Rainbow Dash.\nRainbow Dash: I dunno how all that math works because I'm not scared at all!\nApplejack: Me neither!\n[whoosh]\nApplejack: Huh?\nRainbow Dash: W-what's the matter? It's just a dark hallway full of... disembodied pony legs.\nApplejack: Yeah. Nothin'... creepy about that.\n\nRarity: I'm starting to wonder if maybe this castle doesn't want my expertise!\nFluttershy: Oh dear. Angel? Rarity, have you seen him?\nRarity: I'm not sure he made the trip down with us, dear.\nFluttershy: Oh, goodness! We have to find him. An ancient castle is no place for a bunny. He could get hit by falling debris, or the floor could give out under him! Oh! He could be trapped in a dark place with no way out!\nRarity: [flatly] I can only imagine how that might feel. Hmm...\n\nRainbow Dash: Applejack, if you're scared, you can just admit it. You don't need to put your hoof around me.\nApplejack: Uh, I'm over here.\nRainbow Dash: [scream]\nApplejack: [scream]\nRainbow Dash and Applejack: [both screaming]\nRarity: [gasp]\nFluttershy: Rarity! What is it?\nRarity: I felt something... alive!\nFluttershy: [gasp] Angel!\n[rattle, spin]\nRarity: Well, tapestries or no, I have had just about enough of secret passages, mysterious presences, and unappreciative castles! [echoes]\nFluttershy: But we can't leave now, not with Angel lost somewhere in this dangerous old castle! He could be trapped under a crumbling statue, or stuck high in a tower without food or water or any friends at all!\n\nAngel: [munching]\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, you've got to hear this. [reading] I love to duck behind the paintings, and though the Hall of Hooves still gives her a bit of a fright, the trap door slide is Luna's favorite.\nSpike: \"Hall of Hooves\"?\nTwilight Sparkle: [reading] Soon the Organ to the Outside will be finished. I can hardly wait.\nSpike: What's the \"Organ to the Outside\"?\nTwilight Sparkle: [happily] I have no idea!\n\n[organ music]\n[crash]\nApplejack: You hear that?\nRainbow Dash: You mean, the creepy sound of a haunted pipe organ?\nApplejack: Uh... maybe?\nRainbow Dash: [worried] I don't know what you're talking about!\n[organ music, whinny]\n\nSpike: Uh, Twilight? Did you hear something?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Spike. Quit being such a scaredy-dragon. This castle is thousands of years old, and half of it was destroyed by Nightmare Moon. Of course it makes strange sounds. It's practically falling apart!\n[clatter]\nAngel: [giggles]\nSpike: Oh... kay.\n\nFluttershy: [calling] Angel! Angel!\nRarity: I'm sure we'll find him.\nFluttershy: Angel?\nRarity: [hysterical yelling]\nFluttershy: Did you find Angel? Is he okay?\nRarity: [gasp] They are perfect! No castle in its right mind could possibly object to my restoring such exquisite works of art.\nFluttershy: Oh! They're lovely, Rarity, but... I have to keep looking for Angel. Oh, I hope he doesn't think I've given up on him.\nRarity: I'm right behind you! Won't... [grunts] be... [grunts] a moment!\n\nApplejack: Do you think there's a single room in this castle that isn't filled with terrifying things?\n[rattle]\nRainbow Dash: Whoa! [nervous laughter] It's just old pony armor. What's the big deal?\nApplejack: Yeah! It's not like it's gonna come to life or anything. Right?\n\n[organ note]\nApplejack: Huh?!\n[spinning]\n[growl]\nRainbow Dash: [screams]\n[organ chord]\nRarity: [yelps]\n[spinning]\nFluttershy: [screams]\n[organ chord]\n[carrot platform spins]\n[organ broken chord]\nApplejack: Whoa-oa!\n[lightning and thunder]\nApplejack: [screams]\nRarity: Oh! [screams]\n[more ominous organ music with strings]\n\n[crash of thunder]\nRarity: [groans, spits] Now, you look here, castle! You are very old and very scary! But your wall art is in an atrocious state!\n[wind whistling]\nRarity: And there is nothing you can do to keep me from my sacred task of restoration!\n\nRainbow Dash: Uh... Applejack? If you went back to Ponyville, that means I win, right?\n[rattle, crash]\nRainbow Dash: [screaming]\n\nFluttershy: [calling] Rarity! I know hiding isn't really your sense of humor, but please let this be a joke!\n[light tap]\n[loud organ chord]\nFluttershy: [panicked screaming, panting]\n\n[spinning]\nApplejack: [screams] [echoing] Rainbow? Hello? I guess if I don't find you, I win by default, right?\n\nRarity: [grunts] [grumbles] Of all the castles in Equestria, this is by far the most ungrateful! Oof!\n[lightning]\nFluttershy: [whispered yelling] Angel! Rarity! Oh... I hope you two are together.\n[rock sliding]\nApplejack: [yells]\nRainbow Dash: Haunted statues, creepy armor... Come on, castle! Is that all you got?\n[thunder]\nApplejack, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity: [scream]\nRainbow Dash: [scream]\nFluttershy: [scream]\nApplejack: [scream]\nRarity: Aah! Aaaah! I was only trying to restore ancient art! [muffled crying]\n[lightning]\nFluttershy: [whimpering] [gasp] Angel?\nApplejack: [grunting]\n[crash]\nFluttershy: AAANGEEEEEL!\n\n[distant thunder]\nTwilight Sparkle: What in the world is that?!\nSpike: Oh, you know. Probably just more strange sounds of this old castle falling apart!\nTwilight Sparkle: No one likes sarcasm, Spike.\n\nFluttershy, Rarity, Applejack, and Rainbow Dash: [yelling and screaming]\nSpike: What got into them?\nFluttershy: [grunting] It's okay, Angel! You're okay! You're okay!\nApplejack: Yaaaaah! Shadows everywhere!\nRainbow Dash: [screaming]\nRarity: [crying]\nFluttershy: [sobbing] Aaangeeeeel!\nTwilight Sparkle: Alright, everypony, stop!\nApplejack: Twilight?\nFluttershy: Must... save...

What are you doing here?\nRarity: She's with me...\n[magic release]\nRarity: [gasps] Thank you.\nTwilight Sparkle: Have you all spent the whole night running around, scaring each other?\nApplejack: Well, that depends.\nTwilight Sparkle: On what?\nRainbow Dash: On whether or not you're the Pony of Shadows.\nSpike: What's... the Pony of Shadows?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, that's just an old ponies' tale.\n[organ music]\nSpike: Then who's playing... that?\nTwilight Sparkle: We're going to find out.\n\n[ominous organ music continues]\n[all gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: [whispered] The Pony of Shadows!\n[organ player continues]\nPinkie Pie: Hey, you guys! Did you know I can totally play the organ? Because I didn't!\nAll: Pinkie?!\nPinkie Pie: Check it out!\n[plays sports \"Charge!\" theme]\nRainbow Dash: You're the Pony of Shadows?\nPinkie Pie: [continues playing light melody] The pony of what?\nTwilight Sparkle: See? What'd I tell ya?\nApplejack: I thought you went to ring the school bell all week!\nPinkie Pie: Oh, yeah! I only had to ring it for, like, five minutes! They said that was good enough! Eh, can't imagine why...\n\n[bell ringing]\n\nPinkie Pie: So then, I decided to throw a \"finish ringing the school bell\" party! But I didn't have any bluebells, and you can't throw a \"finish ringing the school bell\" party without bluebells, so I went to Everfree Forest to pick some, but it started to get so chilly. [plays happy organ music] I had to wrap myself up in the tarp I was gonna use to gather flowers, and then I saw Fluttershy and Rarity. But they went into the castle before I could invite them to my party. Luckily, I followed them inside so I could help you all with your party! [stops playing]\nRarity: What party is that?\nPinkie Pie: Uh, the \"everypony come to the scary old castle and hide from each other while I play the organ\" party? [plays note]\n[sproing, thud]\nPinkie Pie: Duh!\n\nRarity: I swear, this is going right back where I found it just as soon as I've returned it to its former glory.\nFluttershy: Now don't go running off again! Oh, I can't believe I was so frightened. Guess I let my imagination get the best of me.\nApplejack: I think we all did.\nPinkie Pie: I always let my imagination run away from me! Then it comes back... with cake!\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, it's good to know that whenever your imagination is getting away from you, a good friend can help you rein it in. And even though I didn't find anything out about the mysterious chest, I'm glad I was here to help all of you.\nRarity: You certainly did that, Twilight.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! Why weren't you scared?\nTwilight Sparkle: Reading Celestia's diary made it hard to be afraid, because I knew what it was like when she and Luna lived here. Knowing something about the past made it easier to deal with my problems in the present, even the scary ones.\n[remarks of agreement]\nTwilight Sparkle: I've just thought of a great idea! Why don't we keep a journal, just like the royal pony sisters?\nFluttershy: All of us?\nTwilight Sparkle: Sure! That way we can learn from each other! And maybe some day, other ponies will read it and learn something, too!\nRarity: What a splendid idea!\nApplejack: I know what my first entry will be! \"Dear Diary, I'm glad Granny Smith's legend wasn't true.\"\nRainbow Dash: Me too!\nPinkie Pie: Me three! Because that means you two are still tied for Most Daring Pony!\nSpike: Heh, Shadow Ponies... How ridiculous is that?\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nRainbow Dash: Four more months, four more months, four more months! I bet you're excited, huh?\nFluttershy: Oh, my.

That's how exciting it is! So what amazing, incredible, awesome adventure do you think Daring Do will have in her next book, huh?\n\nRainbow Dash: [voice over] Will she at long last stalk the Fortress of Talacon, only to be forced to contend with its dreaded and impenetrable arrow defense?

The release of the next book got pushed another two months.\nRainbow Dash: [spit-take] Two more months?! I've been waiting so long already! I don't think I can take another two months! I'll never make it!\nFluttershy: Yeah. I can vouch for that...\nRainbow Dash: Did they give a reason?\nTwilight Sparkle: The publisher just said author A.K. Yearling won't be able to finish the book for another two months. Cupcakes?\nRainbow Dash: [growls] How could you possibly know that before me? I'm the series' biggest fan!\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm just as big a fan as you! In fact, I'm the one who first introduced you to the books, remember?\nRainbow Dash: Oh. Right.\nTwilight Sparkle: A.K. Yearling just might be my favorite author. I know everything about her. Where she grew up, where she studied literature, where she wrote the first Daring Do book...\nRainbow Dash: Where she lives?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh... no, though I could probably find out somehow. Why?\nRainbow Dash: Don't you get it? The new book is obviously delayed because she needs help dealing with whatever everyday nonsense is distracting her from spending her every living breathing second writing so I\u2014 I mean, fans like me, can get to read the new book ASAP! Think about it! We could help her with her laundry, buy her groceries, cooking her meals, whatever! Now, who wouldn't appreciate that?\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmm, I don't know... what she probably wants most of all is respect for her privacy.\nRainbow Dash: She can always just say no.\nTwilight Sparkle: Mmh... I suppose you're right...\nRainbow Dash: Of course I am. So... how's about getting that address?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: You see what I mean? Why would she live in this remote part of Equestria except to keep folks from intruding on her privacy? We should respec\u2014\nRainbow Dash: I think I spotted the house! We're super close!

What happened?\nRainbow Dash: Apparently somepony has intruded on her privacy pretty hard already...\n[knocking]\n[crash]\nApplejack: Hoo-wee, somepony really trashed this place.\nPinkie Pie: Hmm... maybe... or maybe A.K. Yearling's just a terrible, horrible, unbelievable slob!\nRarity: I hope A.K. Yearling's alright!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh no! What if something terrible happened to her?\nRainbow Dash: I know! There might be no more books! Uh... but, of course, I'd be worried about her, too. Heh.\nA.K. Yearling: What are you all doing here?\nRainbow Dash: Uh... A... K-K... Yearling...?

He wanted to partner with Daring Do on her adventures.\nTwilight Sparkle: I know, but she refused! I can't believe it! The real Daring Do and the real Caballeron!\nDaring Do: So let me guess: Ahuizotl has put you up to this? You're stealing the ring to give to him so his hold on the Fortress of Talacon will be good for eight centuries as foretold by prophecy!\nDr. Caballeron: Close, but... no. I'm going to sell this to him, make a bundle, and retire from archaeology in splendor.\nDaring Do: [grunting] Caballeron, you fool!

She handles her business herself.\nRainbow Dash: We've gotta go help!\nTwilight Sparkle: You heard her! She says she works alone!\nRainbow Dash: How can we just stand by and do nothing? You know what's at stake here! Ahuizotl has sought control of the Tenochtitlan Basin since book three!\nTwilight Sparkle: True, but in book four, she defeated Ahuizotl and secured control of the Amulet of Atonement, dispelling the dark magic of the Ketztwctl Empress, and thus protecting the basin with the Radiant Shield of Razdon!\nRainbow Dash: But the Radiant Shield of Razdon is vulnerable to the dark enchantment of the Rings of Scorchero!\nTwilight Sparkle: But are you forgetting that the Rings were scattered to the four corners of Tenochtitlan, thus rendering the dark enchantment powerless?\nRainbow Dash: Only if you assume that the Rings have yet to be retrieved, and the ring Caballeron just stole isn't the last to completely restore the dark tower and its cruel hold on Tenochtitlan! Did you ever think of that?!\nPinkie Pie: You gotta admit, Rainbow Dash makes a pretty good point.\nRainbow Dash: We gotta help Daring Do retrieve the ring for safekeeping before it's too late!\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Okay, but sounds to me like we're in way, way, way over our heads. We're going to need a carefully thought out plan...\nRainbow Dash: I'm coming, Daring Do!\nTwilight Sparkle: That's not a plan!\n\nRainbow Dash: Come on, come on, come on... bingo! Here I come, Daring Do! To join an adventure with the greatest, bravest, coolest, most incredible hero I could ever\u2013 [whimpers] Okay, maybe I just need a sec... just another adventure. No big deal. [smack] Get a grip! I got this. Though, doing it alongside Daring Do... wow! Maybe I could get my picture taken with her, or an autograph\u2013 [smack] There you go again. She's just a pony like any other pony. A pony who stops entire armies of bad guys with nothing more than her bare hooves, and an attitude, and\u2014!

This is your big chance to impress her with your quick wit and courage. [to Daring Do, nervously] I am suuuuuch a huge fan. [laughs nervously]\nDaring Do: [sighs]\nRainbow Dash: Wait, wait, wait! Let me help you! I promise I could be a huge, huge help if you just give me a chance.\nDaring Do: I. Work. Alone.\nRainbow Dash: But why won't you let me team up with you just this once?!\nDaring Do: My work always involves secrets. And since you never know who you can trust, it's best never to trust anypony.\nRainbow Dash: But just because you can't trust some, doesn't mean nopony can be trusted!\nDaring Do: Look, I don't have time to argue\u2014\nRainbow Dash: Neither do I. Let's go!\nDaring Do: [sighs] [under her breath] Can't believe I'm even talking to her...\n\n[bushes rustling]\nRainbow Dash: Looks like they decided to have an early dinner before making their way back down the hill to the marketplace in town.\n[digging noise]\nRainbow Dash: Oh, I see. You're gonna ambush them like in book four at the Horavian caves! Or maybe, that neat trick you did in book three, where you swoop in and knock three guys down with one swing! Or maybe\u2014 [hushed] Okay. I'll be quiet now. Just watching very quietly, heh. Shh. So, what kind of ambush are you gonna use then?\n[bits jingling]\nRainbow Dash: Wow!\n[chewing noises]\n[bits jingling]\nDaring Do: [gravely voice] I have been led to believe you have in your possession an item of significant importance that might be... for sale.\nDr. Caballeron: Oh, uh, well... I did have another buyer lined up, but he's not here, so... sounds like we have a deal.\nAhuizotl: [roars] Caballeron!\nDaring Do: Ahuizotl!\nAhuizotl: The ring!\nDr. Caballeron: [gasps]\n[ring clanking]\nAhuizotl: [roars]\nRainbow Dash: Be cool, Rainbow Dash, be cool... she's got this!\nAhuizotl: The ring, Daring Do! Give it to me!\nDaring Do: Now, Ahuizotl, you know I love you, but I can't give you the ring 'til I've properly proposed.\nAhuizotl: [laughs] Interesting, because my friends here have a proposal of their own. [fingers click]\n[big cats and kitten growling]\nDaring Do: Bring it!\n[big cats growling, punching noises, Daring Do grunting, etc.]\nRainbow Dash: Come on, Daring Do, come on...\n[Wilhelm scream]\nRainbow Dash: Daring Do! I've got your hat! You want me to toss it? Daring Do! Daring Do!\nDaring Do: [grunting]\nRainbow Dash: Whoa! [yelps]\n[cats yowling]\nDaring Do: [grunting]\nRainbow Dash: Don't worry, Daring Do! I'll come help you! Whoa! Ow.\n[thud]\nDaring Do: Don't bother! I'd say you've already helped plenty.\nRainbow Dash: What have I done?\n\nRarity: [gasps] Thank goodness you're alright!\nTwilight Sparkle: Quick, where does it hurt?\nRainbow Dash: In here. Daring Do and the ring have been captured by the dreaded Ahuizotl, and it's all my fault.\nRest of main cast: [gasps]\nTwilight Sparkle: Dash, I'm sure whatever you did was an honest mistake.\nRainbow Dash: Whatever. Let's just go home.\nApplejack: We can't go back now! Looks a mite like she needs our help more than ever!\nRainbow Dash: Trying to help is how I got in this mess in the first place. You were right, Twilight. We should've stayed out of this.\nTwilight Sparkle: Look, there is more going on here than meets the eye. In every Daring Do book, there always is! We can't turn our backs on her!\nRainbow Dash: She doesn't want my help, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: Perhaps. But she might need it anyway.\nRainbow Dash: No. My hero's way better off without me.\nApplejack: This don't sound like you.\nPinkie Pie: Where's the Rainbow Dash who would help anypony at the drop of a hat?\nRarity: Or pith helmet, as the case may be.\nRainbow Dash: She's here where she's got no business being. She should be at home.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's fine to look up to Daring Do, but you've put her so high up on a pedestal, you can't even see your own worth anymore! She's in the fortress, and we're here, and we wouldn't be who we are if we didn't go in after her! And neither would you! So, are you with us, or not?\n\n[underwater sounds]\nDaring Do: Surrender now, Ahuizotl, or I'll be forced to take you down! [grunts]\nAhuizotl: [laughs] Oh, Daring Do, I will so miss your amusing laughter-jokes. Now, I must leave to commence the ring-placing ceremony to unleash eight hundred years of unrelenting, sweltering heat!\n[water thundering]\nAhuizotl: [laughs]\nDaring Do: [sounds of exertion]\n[piranha jaws snapping]\nDaring Do: [sounds of exertion]\nRainbow Dash: Gotcha! [grunts] You can flap too, y'know!\n[crushing rocks]\nDaring Do: I was just about to save myself, y'know.\nRainbow Dash: Of course. I just thought you might need this.\nDaring Do: Have I mentioned yet that I work alone?\nRainbow Dash: Have I mentioned yet that you're lucky I don't?\nDaring Do: [sighs]\n\n[rhythmic thudding]\nAhuizotl: [laughs]\nApplejack: Drop the ring, Ahui... whatever your name is!\nAhuizotl: Hmph, place the ring, quickly! Get it!\n[thuds, ring clanking, etc.]\nDaring Do: Come with me! Help me get all these rings off!\nRainbow Dash: [straining noises]\n[rings clinking]\nDaring Do: [panting] If we can remove the giant ring at the bottom, the whole fortress will collapse!\nRainbow Dash: W-Was this your plan all along?\nDaring Do: I had to find a way to get into the fortress.\nRainbow Dash: You did it on purpose?! But\u2013 but I thought\u2014\nDaring Do: I didn't count on how heavy this ring would be, though... guess having a little help can be handy sometimes.\nAhuizotl: [laughs]\n[rumbling]\nAhuizotl: Stop her!\nDaring Do: [straining noises] You can flap too, y'know!\nRainbow Dash: [straining noises] Ponies! Run! This place is goin' down!\n[Wilhelm scream]\n[rumbling, crumbling]\nAhuizotl: Daring Do! I will have my revenge!\n[shattering]\nDaring Do: Could never have done this without you, Rainbow Dash. I've got a book to finish!\n\nRainbow Dash: Just had the coolest adventure with the coolest pony ever. Came this close to blowing it because I got so wrapped up in how awesome she was, I almost forgot about how awesome I was. Good thing I didn't, 'cause it gave me a chance to show her how important it is to put your trust in somepony else.\n[knocking]\nMessenger Pony: Package from A.K. Yearling.\nRainbow Dash: Sweet! The new book a week before anypony else gets it!

Everypony, welcome the head of the Equestria Games, Ms. Harshwhinny!\nMs. Harshwhinny: Thank you. Now, I'm sure you all know about the Equestria Games, where ponies from all over the land compete for glory in various athletic pursuits. Well, now you littlest ones will have the chance to compete for a weighty responsibility of your very own.\nRainbow Dash: [distant] Oh, come on! Tell 'em the fun part!\nStudents: [Oohing and ahhing]\nRainbow Dash: That's right! All you gotta do is show Ms. Harshwhinny the coolest, most spectacular, most rocking routine and you're going to the Games! So who's going to be the lucky ponies?!\nDiamond Tiara: It's gotta be me!\nAura: Maybe it's me!\nScootaloo: Maybe it's us!\nSnips and Snails: Maybe it's us!\n[creaking]\n[thud]\nSnips: Hey! It could happen!\n\n[theme song]\n\nRainbow Dash: So, the winning team gets to carry the Ponyville flag at the Equestria Games! Oh, you are gonna love this!\nMs. Harshwhinny: Ms. Dash, will you please curb your over-enthusiastic outbursts? Now then, let me be clear on the rules. You ponies will form teams. Each team will create their own flag carrying routine. Everypony will be judged on grace, style and originality. There's a most complicated scoring system, which I will elaborate upon now. Firstly\u2014\nRainbow Dash: Aw, get to the nitty-gritty later. Tell 'em the important stuff! Like who's the coach! [blows whistle] That's right! Me! And you know why I'm qualified to coach you? Guess who carried the Cloudsdale flag in the Games when she was a little filly? Me! I'll never forget it\u2014I burst into the stadium, spreading my wings, the flag flapping in the breeze. I did tricks with that flag the likes of which nopony saw before and nopony's seen since!\n[thud]\nMs. Harshwhinny: Professionalism, Ms. Dash. I must insist. If you want to keep your job as coach of these ponies, you must maintain a professional attitude and keep your emotions in check! Am I making myself absolutely, one hundred percent crystal clear?\nRainbow Dash: Yes, Ms. Harshwhinny. Y'know, \"professionalism\" is my middle name. Rainbow Professionalism Dash.\nMs. Harshwhinny: Hmph! Well, in three days time, Ms. Dash will accompany anypony competing to the Crystal Empire, where you will demonstrate your routines for me and the other judges, who will judge you very professionally.\nRainbow Dash: Ahem. Yes. Quite, quite correct. In the meantime, get ready to train, and train hard, because I know this opening ceremony is the single most important thing that will ever happen in your young lives! But, I know you're up for the challenge. And so am I! Wooho\u2014! Ahem... meet me after school tomorrow at 1500 hours. Sharp. And show me your flag carrying skills. I am outta here. Professionally. See how professionally?\nMs. Harshwhinny: Ugh. Ponies, the most important thing is this: Your routine needs to show what your town means to you. So, do Ponyville proud. Work hard, be bold, wow me. That is all!\n[school bell rings]\n\n[foals talking]\nScootaloo: So what do you say we come up with the perfect routine and win this thing?\nApple Bloom: I'd say that's rootin'-tootin' terrific!\nSweetie Belle: But there's one problem! I bet everypony in class is planning to compete!\nScootaloo: Listen. Somepony in our class is gonna carry that flag, so it might as well be us! Crusaders, are you in or are you in? 'Cause I'm in!\nApple Bloom: Me too!\n[beat]\nSweetie Belle: Me three!\nScootaloo: Alright, the winning routine needs to show what's important about Ponyville, right?\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: Right!\nScootaloo: So... what's special about Ponyville? It's... it's... I got it! It's a place where different kinds of ponies live together as friends!\nApple Bloom: Earth ponies like me!\nSweetie Belle: Unicorns like me!\nScootaloo: And Pegasi like me! So somehow we got to figure out a way to show that in our act.\nSweetie Belle: We're gonna need a plan.\nApple Bloom: And a lot of hard work!\nScootaloo: And a whole bunch of practice! But take it from me; we may just be little ponies, but we have hearts as strong as horses!\n\n[Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle]\nWe're the toughest little ponies in town\nGot the moves, got the mojo, no harder working ponies around\nWe are a trio, work as a team\nWe'll be the first ponies out on the flag-waving scene\n\nWe're the toughest little ponies in town\nGot the moves, got the mojo, no harder working ponies around\nWe are a trio, work as a team\nWe'll be the first ponies out on the flag-waving scene\n\nWe get going when the going gets tough\nWe know our very best is just never enough\nWe're kinda short, but so what?

And we have [starts singing] hearts\u2014\nSilver Spoon: Sure. But you know what you don't have?\nDiamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: Your cutie marks! Blank flanks, blank flanks, blank flanks!\nApple Bloom: What does that have to do with flag carryin'?\nSilver Spoon: Having cutie mark-less ponies represent Ponyville would be unthinkable.\nDiamond Tiara: And we, of course, already have our cutie marks. So we know who's gonna be in the winner's circle.\nScootaloo: Listen, you two! Cutie marks or no cutie marks, you'll see! The Crusaders are gonna carry that flag at the Games.\nSilver Spoon: May the best ponies win!\nScootaloo: Game on!\n\nAnd we're playing to win as we gallop to glory\nWe can conquer any challenge we're in\nWe've got hea-a-a-arts, hearts strong as horses\nHearts strong as horses\n\nRainbow Dash: Show me what you got, Cutie Mark Crusaders, and make it good!\nScootaloo: Don't worry, we will!\nSweetie Belle: Now, this is just a little something we threw together. It's not perfect yet, not even close.\nDiamond Tiara: Let's watch the Cutie Mark \"Goof-saders\" do their saddle routine.\nSilver Spoon: They're gonna be a hot mess!\nDiamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: [giggling]\nScootaloo: Since the dawn of recorded time, in one town of amazing amazingness, three types of ponies coexist!\nApple Bloom: We are Earth ponies!\nSweetie Belle: We are unicorns!\nScootaloo: We are Pegasi! And the town where friendship reigns is our home. Now, welcome to the stadium, the flag of the place we love best...\nCrusaders: Ponyville forever! Yay!\nScootaloo: It's kind of a work in progress. So? What did you think?\nRainbow Dash: That was ama\u2014 [thinking] Wait. Hold on now. Gotta stay calm, cool and collected. [aloud] To give a calm, clear analysis\u2014 wait. You whipped that act together just yesterday?! That is\u2014 [thinking] Professionalism, Dash, keep those emotions in check! [aloud] Overall, it was... kinda, sorta... [quickly] overall, it was okay. Keep working hard. Who knows? You might have a shot. Gotta go!\nApple Bloom: Do y'all think she liked it?\nSweetie Belle: I'm not really sure.\nScootaloo: You heard her! If we keep working hard, we might have a shot! So let's keep working! Trot to it, ponies!\nDiamond Tiara: Did you see that?! I can't believe I'm saying this. They could win!\nSilver Spoon: But how do we stop them? We already called them blank flanks!\nDiamond Tiara: Then we need to find a new way to get under their skin. Or maybe... get under their wings.\n\nDiamond Tiara: Girls, we just wanted to say your act is quite impressive!\nSweetie Belle: Wait... what?\nApple Bloom: Um... thanks?\nSilver Spoon: Oh, but of course. As a matter of fact, we think you're very brave.\nScootaloo: Brave? Why?\nDiamond Tiara: Isn't it obvious? It is to us. In fact, it's obvious to everypony. You're showing all three types of Ponyville ponies, yet you have a Pegasus pony...\nDiamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: ...who can't even fly!\nApple Bloom: What in tarnation does that have to do with anything?\nSilver Spoon: I'd say not even being able to fly has everything to do with everything. Doesn't it?\nDiamond Tiara: I mean, a Pegasus pony at your age? You should've been flying long ago.\nScootaloo: So what if my wings can't get me off the ground?\nDiamond Tiara: Your career as a flag carrier isn't getting off the ground either.\nSilver Spoon: Ms. Harshwhinny will never pick a Pegasus pony who can't fly to represent Ponyville in front of all of Equestria.\nSweetie Belle: Ms. Harshwhinny never said anything about that!\nSilver Spoon: I would've thought that was obvious.\nDiamond Tiara: Well, have fun practicing anyway, even if your routine will never\u2014how shall I say\u2014take off!\nSweetie Belle: Don't listen to them, Scootaloo. Scootaloo? You okay?\nScootaloo: This routine isn't working how it is. We've gotta rethink my part in the whole thing.\nSweetie Belle: What?\nApple Bloom: Why?\nScootaloo: If we wanna win, I'm gonna have to fly!\nSweetie Belle: Is that even possible?\nApple Bloom: And by tomorrow?\nScootaloo: Maybe I can win if I work twice as hard. See? Oof! Maybe... three times as hard.\nApple Bloom: Golly, I don't know, Scootaloo, I don't think that's the problem.\nScootaloo: Well, I know this for sure \u2013 flying is the only way we're gonna win, so it's back to practice!\nSweetie Belle: Is this a good idea?\nScootaloo: Whoaaaaa!\n[thud]\nScootaloo: I'll just work four times as hard!\nApple Bloom: Probably not.\n\nScootaloo: [sighs] Guys, guys, guys! Try it again!\nApple Bloom: [yawns] But we've been rehearsin' all the livelong day! We're gettin' tired!\nScootaloo: Fine! We'll skip to my big impressive flying entrance. So you've done the do-si-do to the left, then to the right, and then there's the hoop. Then I come in\u2014\n[thud]\nScootaloo: Not quite what I had in mind. We'll just... try that part again. [straining noises]\nApple Bloom: [hushed] I liked the routine the way it was!\nSweetie Belle: [hushed] Me too! But all she cares about now is flying!\nScootaloo: Don't worry, I'll be flying high tomorrow on our final run-through for Rainbow Dash. I'm gonna get this, you'll see. [straining noises]\n[thud]\n\nRainbow Dash: Okay, Cutie Mark Crusaders, this is your final run before you show it at the stadium tomorrow. I know you're gonna absolutely, positively\u2014 have a lot of fun, heheh. Okay, go! [blows whistle]\nScootaloo: [panting] Ponyville! Home of the, um...\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: [hushed] Friendship!\nScootaloo: Ah, friendship, right! Uh, there are four\u2014 no, three kinds of ponies.\nApple Bloom: [yawns]\nSweetie Belle: [hushed] Left, left!\nApple Bloom: [hushed] I'm sorry! I'm just tired! And then I dip, and then we turn, and\u2014 Sorry!\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: [straining noises]\n[boing]\n[thud]\nScootaloo: Ta-da! Oof! [panting] So? What'cha think?\nRainbow Dash: That's... y'know... good and all, heheh... I just thought... maybe possibly you might wanna go back to, say, the first version of the act, which was, I dunno, what's the word, better? Just do the routine as it was! Don't mess with success, right? Seriously. Now I need to... go coach these other ponies! And don't forget, we've got to catch the early train for the Crystal Empire. See you in the morning!\nScootaloo: What are we gonna do?! We're competing tomorrow, and I still can't fly! Unless...\nSweetie Belle: I'm just too tired! I can't keep going!\nApple Bloom: Me too! I'm tired, I'm hungry, and now I hate this routine! It feels like it's all about you now!\nSweetie Belle: She's right. It's like you don't even need us anymore!\nScootaloo: Of course I need you! Without you two, who's gonna hold up the hoop?\nApple Bloom: Rrgh! You don't listen to yourself! Forget it. I'm goin' home to get some sleep.\nScootaloo: So? Are you gonna leave me too?\nSweetie Belle: We've gotta catch the early train to the Crystal Empire. I'd better get some rest. See you in the morning, Scootaloo.\nScootaloo: Come on, Scootaloo! Do it for Ponyville! Just got to try twenty times as hard! [straining noises] Thirty times as hard...! Oof! Just... a little... harder!\n[thud]\nScootaloo: [straining noises] [sighs] I can't fly. I just... can't.\n\nTrain conductor: Crystal Empire! All aboard!\nSweetie Belle: Scootaloo? Where is she?\nApple Bloom: She'd better get here soon! This here train is about to leave!\nScootaloo: Here I am...\nApple Bloom: We were scared you were gonna miss the train!\nScootaloo: I... I'm not going.\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: What?!\nScootaloo: I'm the weak link. If I go, and fall, flop, or do anything but fly, I'm gonna blow it for you two.\nSweetie Belle: I can't believe you're quitting on us!\nScootaloo: But you're better off without me!\nSweetie Belle: But that's not true, Scootaloo!\nApple Bloom: You know what, Sweetie Belle? Forget it. If she's gonna quit, we don't want her, and we don't need her!\nScootaloo: Fine!\nApple Bloom: Fine!\nSweetie Belle: Fine...\nTrain conductor: All aboard!\n[train puffing]\n[train whistle blowing]\n\nRainbow Dash: How's my favorite routine going today? Oh, I just can't keep it in! I want you to win so bad! [to the BGM] Bom, bom, bom, bom... and then Scootaloo does that [half-whistles] through the hoop!\nApple Bloom: Well, there ain't gonna be a Scootaloo.\nSweetie Belle: She's staying home.\nRainbow Dash: She's what?!\nApple Bloom: She got it in her head that the only way to represent Ponyville was by flyin' in our routine! When she couldn't do it, she told us that she was quittin'.\nRainbow Dash: And then you tried to stop her from doing that, right?\nSweetie Belle: Well, actually, we kinda told her...\nApple Bloom: ...uh, that we didn't want a quitter.\nRainbow Dash: Hang on. Are you nuts?! You're a team, and a team never leaves a friend behind!\n[ding]\n[brakes squealing]\nRainbow Dash: Come on!\nDiamond Tiara: Sorry you can't make it! We'll take a picture for you from the winner's circle!\nDiamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: [laughing, under]\nSweetie Belle: I do not like them one bit.\nRainbow Dash: Put on some speed, girls!\n\n[ripping noises]\n[clang]\nRainbow Dash: Throwing away your scooter?!\nScootaloo: Rainbow Dash?\nRainbow Dash: Yup, but not just me.\nScootaloo: I don't wanna see them. And what are they doing here, anyway? They're supposed to be on the train.\nApple Bloom: We're not goin'.\nSweetie Belle: Not without you, Scootaloo.\nRainbow Dash: What's gotten into you, Scootaloo?\nScootaloo: I didn't want to ruin their chance to win just because I couldn't fly.\nRainbow Dash: And who said you had to?\nScootaloo: But flying's what Pegasus ponies are supposed to do! You flew when you carried the flag in the games!\nRainbow Dash: But that was me! You're you! And it just doesn't matter if you can fly or not. Your routine was amazing 'cause it represented exactly what makes Ponyville special. You do still know what that is, right?\nSweetie Belle: Friendship.\nApple Bloom: Three kinds of ponies livin' together as friends. Just like us. Earth ponies...\nSweetie Belle: ...unicorns...\nScootaloo: ...and Pegasi. But Rainbow Dash... what if... what if my wings never grow? What if I never fly?\nRainbow Dash: Listen, Scootaloo. Maybe you'll fly someday, or maybe you won't. You're all kinds of awesome anyway. Who's the toughest little pony in town?\n\n[Sweetie Belle]\nGot the moves, got the mojo...\n\nGot the moves, got the mojo...\n\n[Apple Bloom]\nNo harder working pony around.\n\nNo harder working pony around.\n\n[Scootaloo]\nWe are a trio, work as a team\n\nWe are a trio, work as a team\n\n[Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle]\nWe'll be the first ponies out on the flag-waving scene\n\nWe'll be the first ponies out on the flag-waving scene\n\nScootaloo: So let's get to the Crystal Empire and let's do the routine as it was!

She was the power-mad owner of a hair-care product company. A tragic accident at her shampoo factory in Maretropolis not only gave her mane strange new powers, but also caused her to go completely insane! She and her henchponies are planning to break into the Maretropolis Museum and steal the Electro-Orb, so she can use it to power up her doomsday device! Of course, the Mane-iac wouldn't have even known if Hum Drum hadn't slipped up and told her all about it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hum Drum?\nSpike: Nah, the guy in the blue boots and pointless red cape.

Where'd she go?!\nPinkie Pie: Wheeeeeeee!\nSpike: She could be miles away from here by now!

Use your jewelry to create attack constructs!\nRarity: What's an attack construct?!\nSpike: Just think of something, anything, and your bracelet makes it appear!\n[smashing crockery]\nSpike: Something useful!\n[thud]\nSpike: The Electro-Orb!\nMane-iac: Well, this has been quite the mane-raising experience. But I really must be going. [laughs]\n[thud]\nMane-iac: Why, thank you, Hum Drum! [evil laughter]\n[whipping noises]\nSpike: I'm Hum Drum...?! Oh no... [straining noises] Applejack! You gotta... help stop the... tornado from destroying.. the city!\nApplejack: But every time I move, this darn lasso gets tighter!\nSpike: You're psychically connected to it! Will it to where you want it to go, and it'll obey you!\n[lasso whipping]\n[thud]\nPinkie Pie: [giggles] That was spin-tastic!\nApplejack: Lemme get this straight: We've been sucked into some kind of comic-book world?\nSpike: Technically, it's called Maretropolis. And if we wanna get back to Ponyville, I think we have to stop the Mane-iac from using her doomsday device to destroy it!\nRainbow Dash: No biggie. I was already awesome. And now we've all got superpowers!\nSpike: Almost all of us have superpowers...\nRarity: But you must have them too, Spikey-boo. Your character is wearing a cape!\nSpike: Yeah, for absolutely no reason. He's pretty much useless...\nTwilight Sparkle: Good thing you're not really Hum Drum, then.\nSpike: Yeah, good thing...\nRainbow Dash: So the six of us Power Ponies will take care of Mane-iac, and get us back to Ponyville!\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, where is the Mane-iac building her doomsday device?\nSpike: Her top-secret headquarters! But you'd better get there quick. That glowing orb she just stole is what she's going to use to power it up!\nApplejack: Lead the way, Spike!\nRainbow Dash: Then leave the rest to us!\nSpike: [sighs]\n\n[neon light humming]\nSpike: There it is!\nApplejack: Is that a... shampoo factory?\nTwilight Sparkle: All right, Power Ponies, here's the plan. Rarity, you, me and\u2014\nRainbow Dash: Come on out, Mane-iac! Or the Power Ponies are comin' in!\n[thunder crash]\nTwilight Sparkle: So much for \"element of surprise\".\nSpike: Guess I'll just hang back here doing nothing.\n[electricity crackling]\nFluttershy: Oh, I don't think she's home. Maybe we should just come back later.\nMane-iac: [evil laughter]\nRarity: She's home.\n[garage door opening]\nApplejack: Time to Power Pony up!\nPinkie Pie: Ooh!

You aren't even just a little angry right now?\nTwilight Sparkle: Nice work, Power Ponies! Now let's take care of the Mane-iac and get ourselves home!\nMane-iac: I don't think so! I have a city to destroy, and I'm not about to let the Power Ponies stop me! Not this time!\nRainbow Dash: Just watch us!\nSpike: The Hairspray Ray of Doom! It stops you in your tracks and renders your powers useless!\n[hairspray hissing]\n[clunk]\nRarity: We'll just see about that!\n[hairspray hissing]\n[ice cracking]\n[tink]\nMane-iac: [evil laughter]\nSpike: Fluttershy, please! Just a little anger?!\nFluttershy: Well, I'm not so much angry as I am concerned, bordering on terrified!\n[hairspray hissing]\nSpike: Don't spray!\nMane-iac: [cackles] Oh, Hum Drum, why in all of Maretropolis would I use the Hairspray Ray of Doom on you? Rather pointless, don't you think?\nMain cast: [shouts of concern]\n[door slamming]\n[clang]\n\nSpike: What am I supposed to do? I'm useless.

I don't mean to interrupt, but aren't you forgetting about somepony?\nMane-iac: Hum Drum? Little guy? No superpowers whatsoever? [laughs] He's utterly useless!\n[timer ringing]\n[hairspray hissing]\nMane-iac: Puh-lease. Everypony knows you just keep him around because you [condescending tone] feel sowwy for him. Wah. Wah.\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe in your world. But in our world, Spike\u2014 uh, Hum Drum always comes through when we need him! Always!\nRest of Power Ponies: [agreements]\nSpike: I'm not like Hum Drum! When my friends really need me, I do come through! And they need me now!\nMane-iac: [laughs] I see dementia must be a side-effect of prolonged exposure to the Hairspray Ray of Doom. [laughs] Tonight, we stand upon the brink of immortality, for we collectively\u2014though, mostly me\u2014have finally defeated our most hated nemeses!

Vampire fruit bats are attackin' Sweet Apple Acres!\nTwilight Sparkle: But I thought the fruit bats usually stayed put in the west orchard.\nApplejack: The fruit bats do, but these aren't just your everyday ordinary fruit bats. They're vampire fruit bats! I'll be darned if they think they're gonna sink their fangs into my blue ribbon apple.\nRest of main cast: [Wow, etc.]\nSpike: Awesome!\nApplejack: This here's our entry into the Appleloosa State Fair's produce competition. [exhales] You know how much TLC goes into getting an apple to grow like this?\nRarity: Applejack! When you go big, you really go big!\nApplejack: Them vampire bats want to shrivel it up like a raisin!\nFluttershy: Oh, I'm sure if we just let them know how special that particular apple is to you, they'll leave it alone.\nApplejack: Yeah, right. Be my guest.\n\n[bats chittering quietly]\nFluttershy: Um, excuse me, Mr. Vampire Bat\u2014\n[splat]\nFluttershy: We were just wondering if maybe you wouldn't mind leaving that really big apple alone?\n[seeds hammering]\nFluttershy: [gasps]\nApplejack: Well? What'd he say?\nFluttershy: Um... yes.\nApplejack: Huh?!\nFluttershy: But... it could've been a no.\nApplejack: Oh.\nFluttershy: This is the first vampire fruit bat I've ever met and, well, it might take some time for me to really understand their language.\nApplejack: Uh-huh. And in the meantime, this pest and his vermin friends are gonna go after my prized apple and, while they're at it, every other apple in the orchard!

These vampire fruit bats sound downright dreadful.\nApplejack: So let's get to roundin' them up so they don't destroy the rest of my orchard.\nPinkie Pie: [to the tune of Winter Wrap Up] Fruit bat round-up, fruit bat round-up!\nFluttershy: Um, excuse me, but, um, what if instead of rounding them up, we... let them have part of the orchard?\nApplejack: [whinny] Have you lost your pest-lovin' mind?!\nFluttershy: They're only here because they're hungry! If we build a sanctuary for them, they could have their own apples to enjoy! After a while, they could even help the rest of your orchard! The vampire bats don't eat the seeds of the apples, and when they spit them out, they grow into even more productive apple trees!\nApplejack: Listen, Fluttershy. That sounds real nice 'n' all, but every second we spend buildin' this so-called 'sanctuary' is a second they'll spend destroyin' orchards! You don't know what it was like the last time there was an infestation, but Granny Smith has told me enough stories about it that just the thought of it gives me nightmares! [narrating] Granny says we lost a huge section of orchard that year. They had to ration out apples all winter!\nRainbow Dash: What about the cider? There was still cider, right?\nApplejack: Not...a...drop.\nRainbow Dash: No cider?! No cider?! We need to round up these monsters, and we need to do it now!\nApplejack: If Granny Smith wasn't with Apple Bloom an' Big Mac checkin' out our produce competition in Appleloosa, she'd be here tellin' us to do just that!\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I think Applejack is right. I just wish there was another way we could convince them not to eat them in the first place. Maybe there is...!\n\nYes, it comes down to just one simple fact\nThey've crossed the line, it's time that we attack!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: So, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that I found a spell that can get the vampire fruit bats to stop wanting to suck the juice from the apples. But in order for the spell to work, I need the bats' full and complete attention.\nFluttershy: [gasps] Oh no.\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy, I need you to do your Stare on the bats.\nFluttershy: Oh, gosh, I don't know.\nRainbow Dash: What's the problem? You've used the Stare plenty of times before!\nFluttershy: Yes, but it's not something I take lightly. I've made a vow not to use it except in dire circumstances.\nApplejack: This circumstance is plenty dire to me!\nRainbow Dash: Me too! Think of the cider! Won't somepony please think of the cider?!\nFluttershy: I'm sorry. I just don't like the idea of taking away the thing that really makes the vampire fruit bats [inhales] vampire fruit bats! It just feels wrong!\nTwilight Sparkle: But if we don't do this, there won't be any apples left for anypony here in Ponyville. Doesn't that feel wrong, too?\n\nApplejack: So what's it gonna be, Fluttershy? Will you do your Stare on the bats or not?\nFluttershy: Um... Um... Okay, I'll do it.\nRarity: Good choice. I knew you wouldn't side with those icky bats! [whimpers]\nFluttershy: They're not icky.\nRainbow Dash: First round of cider's on me!\nApplejack: Hold it right there! We've gotta round up these beasts with wings first. Time's a-wastin'!\n\n[bats chittering]\n\nRarity: [muffled] [yelps] Ew, ew, ew, ewwww!\n[bat gulps and spits]\nRainbow Dash: Gotcha!\nPinkie Pie: [giggles]\nRarity: [screams]\nApplejack: Good work, everypony! I think we got 'em all! [to Fluttershy] Now all we need is for you do to your Stare.\nFluttershy: Oh, um, are you sure I really need\u2014 Okay. I really, really, really hate to do this to you... I just hope you can forgive me...\n[bats hissing]\nApplejack: Good... Now you go, Twilight!\nTwilight Sparkle: Alright.\n[magic humming]\nTwilight Sparkle: You can stop staring, Fluttershy.\nSpike: Did it work?\nApplejack: Only one way to find out for sure.\n[bat sniffing, chittering]\nRainbow Dash: Ye-he-heah, whoo!\nApplejack: My crop is saved! Yee-haw!\nRainbow Dash: We'll be drinking cider all winter long!\nApplejack: I wanna thank you for your help. I couldn't have done it without you.\nSpike: Aw, don't mention it, Applejack. It was my pleasure! Really!\nApplejack: Now all we gotta do is sweep up these cores so I can start buckin' fresh tomorrow mornin'!\nFluttershy: [sniffs]\n\nApplejack: Apple Bucking Day, take two!\n[rooster crowing]\nApplejack: Yee-haw! Time to collect those juicy, sweet apples! [grunts]\n[splat]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: The spell didn't work!\nApplejack: You're darn tootin' the spell didn't work! I think we're gonna have to take more extreme measures!\nRainbow Dash: I hear ya, Applejack! C'mon, everypony! Let's track down those vampire bats!\n[bats chittering]\n[splat]\nApplejack: Wait a minute... I don't think these bats are the ones that sucked my apples dry.\nRarity: But if the vampire bats aren't eating your apples...\nTwilight Sparkle: Who is? Fluttershy, you're our animal expert. Do you know of any other creature that might be capable of this?\nFluttershy: I'm sorry. I don't.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, there's only one way to find out. We'll have to catch whoever it is in the act.\nRarity: And how do you propose we do that?\nTwilight Sparkle: A stakeout...!\n\nRainbow Dash: [spookily] The witching hour...\n[owl hoots]\nFluttershy: Maybe we should just call this off. Not sure about the rest of you guys, [entranced] but I'm really hungry... [drip, drip, gulp]\nRarity: Oh, Fluttershy, it'll be okay. Don't forget, darling, we're all in this together.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's right. Nopony leaves this orchard until we've solved this mystery. Agreed?\nRest of main cast: Agreed!\nApplejack: Does everypony have their pony signals? Now remember, Pinkie Pie, only use the signal if you see somethin' suspicious.\nPinkie Pie: I got it. Something suspicious...\nFluttershy: [sniffing]\nPinkie Pie: Whatcha doin'?!\nApplejack: Alright, now everypony split up. We'll each patrol our own row of the orchard. Whoever or whatever's destroyin' my apples has gotta be here somewhere.\nFluttershy: I have a bad feeling about this. A really bad feeling about this... That apple... It looks... [entranced] so juicy... and sweet... [slurps]\n\n[biting]\nPinkie Pie: What was that?! [gasps] Suspicious! [giggles] It's pony signal time!\n\nRarity: Who's there? Oh, well, there's obviously no need to worry about that shadowy figure overhead... [frightened] Or maybe there is! I think I'll just go see how Rainbow Dash is doing...\n\nRainbow Dash: Uh... who's there? Answer me or you'll regret it! Fine, have it your own way! Take that, you, you, you... scarecrow... Oh.\n[rustling]\n\n[owl hoots]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\n[slurping]\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack, what is it?\nPinkie Pie: Suspicious!\nFluttershy: [hisses]\n\nFluttershy: [slurps]\nPinkie Pie: Fluttershy? Yoo-hoo! Fluttershy!\nFluttershy: [hisses]\nRarity: That's not Fluttershy... That's Flutterbat!\nTwilight Sparkle: We've gotta get her down from there!\nRarity: Uh... Fluttershy, sweetness, please come down, and... do stop being a vampire bat.\nFluttershy: [hisses] [slurps]\nRainbow Dash: Fluttershy! It's me, Rainbow Dash! Why don't you cut the bat act and come on down?!\nFluttershy: [hisses]\nRainbow Dash: [yelps] Whoa! Maybe we should just let her come down when she's ready.\nPinkie Pie: Flutterbat on the loose! Run for your lives!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, calm down! See? She's back on her... branch.\nPinkie Pie: She's just biding her time! Waiting for the right moment to pounce!\nApplejack: Pinkie Pie, bats don't eat ponies. Not even vampire bats.\nPinkie Pie: But maybe vampire ponies eat other ponies! I'm not taking any chances!\nRarity: How did this happen? That's what I don't understand.\nTwilight Sparkle: I think this was actually our fault.\nRainbow Dash: Our fault?\nApplejack: And how'd you figure that?\n[magic humming, synth-electronic noises]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, so this is me, these are the bats, and this is Fluttershy doing her Stare. The spell was supposed to go right onto the bats like this, but somehow the spell must have backfired. It took the vampire fruit bats' desire to be vampire fruit bats and transferred that desire into Fluttershy. C'mon! We'll reverse the spell and make it right!\nPinkie Pie: Then what are we waiting for? Let's save Fluttershy before that thing eats us all!\nRainbow Dash: Hit the deck!\nRest of main cast: [yelps]\nPinkie Pie: Follow that bat!\n\nRarity: I can't believe we lost her!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Fluttershy, where are you?\nFluttershy: [hisses] [slurps]\nApplejack: Look out! Whoa!\nRainbow Dash: If she keeps this up, your whole crop will be gone in no time!\nApplejack: That's the least of my worries. I just want my friend back.\nTwilight Sparkle: We'll never get her back unless we corner her and catch her so I can reverse the spell!\n\n[wolf howling]\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] There she is!\nFluttershy: [hisses]\nApplejack: There she goes!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, this is no use. I think the only way we're gonna catch her is if we find a way to lure her closer to us.\nApplejack: But even if we can lure her to us, how're we gonna get her to stay still long enough for you to do your reverse spell?\nPinkie Pie: Aww, if only we had Fluttershy to do her Stare on the Flutterbat.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] That's it!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, let's get our friend back. Action stations!\nRainbow Dash: So much for having the winning apple in the Appleloosa State Fair, huh?\nApplejack: [sighs]\nFluttershy: [sniffs] [hisses]\nRainbow Dash: [hushed] She's coming!\nFluttershy: [hisses]\n[magic humming]\nFluttershy: Oh... where am I?\nRest of main cast: [cheering]\nApplejack: Thank goodness you're okay!\nFluttershy: But... what happened to me?\nPinkie Pie: You turned into a vampire pony!\nFluttershy: [gasps] I tried to eat ponies?!\nPinkie Pie: Of course not!\nFluttershy: So I wasn't a vampire?\nPinkie Pie: Yes!\nFluttershy: Yes I was, or yes I wasn't?\nPinkie Pie: Yes, you were!\nFluttershy: But I didn't try and eat ponies?\nPinkie Pie: Yes!\nFluttershy: I did?!\nPinkie Pie: No!\nFluttershy: I'm confused...\nRarity: Me too... and I was there!\n\n[bats chittering]\nApplejack: Fluttershy, I'm real sorry I didn't take your suggestion in the first place.\nFluttershy: And don't forget, now you'll get seeds that will grow into even bigger and better apple trees.\nRainbow Dash: Does that mean what I think it means?\nApplejack: Yup! More cider too.\nRainbow Dash: Yea-he-heah, whoo!\n\nSpike: Okay, got the part about the spell, Fluttershy turning into a bat, building a sanctuary...\nApplejack: Be sure to put in there that I came to see that my short-term solution was a little short-sighted.\nFluttershy: And that you shouldn't let anypony pressure you into doing something that you don't think is right.

How'd you manage to get us seats for tomorrow night?\nRarity: Oh, I gave some designs to the costume designer, so he pulled a few strings.\nApplejack, Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash: Cool!\nRarity: That is what makes Manehattan so splendid and amazing. You do something nice for somepony, and then you never know when they'll do something nice for you!\nApplejack: So then you can do something nice for us!\nFluttershy: Like get us in to see Hinny of the Hills!\nRainbow Dash: Which is only the best musical in all of Equestria!\nApplejack: It must be good if Rainbow Dash is impressed.

The dresses are all completely finished, all made from a fabulous new fabric I've been developing for months. Stretchy, but not clingy. Shimmery, but not showy.\nFluttershy: Sounds amazing.\nRarity: There's nothing left for me to do but check in at the runway with my dresses by two this afternoon.\nPinkie Pie: Oh, that's funny. Because that clock over there makes it seem like that's only ten minutes from now!\n[thunder rumbling]\nRarity: Oh, my ribbons and threads. And the runway ballroom is all the way across town!

Is this cab taken?\nCherry Fizzy: The line ends back there, \"buddy\"!\nRainbow Dash: Huh? What? Does everypony in this town want a cab?\nRarity: I'm afraid getting a taxi at this time could prove almost impossible!\nTwilight Sparkle: Please won't you let her have this taxi? She has somewhere very important to be right away!\nBusinesspony: Not likely! She can get in line like the rest of us!\nPonies: [complaining]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, it's no use!

How could I possibly forget them?! [gasps] I'm dooooomed!\n\"Luggage Cart\": Got 'em right here, ma'am! Your friends told me you need these in a hurry, so I offered to race 'em over myself. \"Anything for that nice mare,\" I told 'em!\nRarity: You're a lifesaver!\n\nRarity: [sighs] I made it! And with seconds to spare! Hello, everypony. Pleased to meet you all.\nPrim Hemline: Rarity, I presume.\nRarity: You must be Prim Hemline, the host of this grand event. How do you\u2014?\nPrim Hemline: Miss Rarity, how is it that all your competitors are here half an hour early, and yet you arrive seconds before we begin?\nRarity: Uhhhh... [chuckles nervously] Just... lucky, I guess.\nPrim Hemline: Once we're done here, you're to finish setting up backstage, so you'll be ready for your run-through appointment. You show your designs last. We keep to a precise schedule, so let's try to be more than a few seconds early, hmm? Tomorrow is the contest to see which one of you gets to stay to meet top designers all across the city. The rest of you must go home early. So sad. Dismissed!\nSuri Polomare: [chuckles] I'm so glad you made it, Rarity!\nRarity: Me too, but everything just seems to keep working out!\nSuri Polomare: Don't you remember me? Suri Polomare from the Ponyville Knitters League?\nRarity: Oh, yes, of course, of course! I\u2013 I thought you looked familiar, but I couldn't place it. You haven't been back in years!\nSuri Polomare: Because I moved here to make it in the big city. [laughs], okay?\nRarity: Oh, good for you, Sur\u2014\nSuri Polomare: Ooh, it's so good to see you! And now here we are, competing! [laughs], okay?\nRarity: Yes, yes. Well, good luck!\nSuri Polomare: Oh, I don't need luck. Would you like a hoof with your things?\nRarity: Why, thank you so much!\n\nSuri Polomare: My, your collection is gorgeous!\nRarity: Oh now, I'm sure your collection is equally lovely, if not more so!\nSuri Polomare: It's alright, but nothing like this! Take my culottes, for example \u2013 they are simply crying out for just the right accent, but I haven't the slightest notion where I\u2014 [gasps] Actually... just a touch of this fabric could be perfect with it. W\u2013 Oh, hey, would you mind terribly if I took a swatch?\nRarity: Oh, not at all! Here, I have loads extra.\nSuri Polomare: You're sure?\nRarity: Positive! Oh, well, it's been wonderful getting caught up, and I don't wish to be rude, but I must finish my preparations and I am a bit late as it... is?\n\nRarity: Hello! I'm here half an hour early for my run-through appointment, just the way Prim likes!\nJanine Manewitz: Get in line over there. Oh my, that fabric's gorgeous, did you make that yourself?\nRarity: Oh, why, yes. It's stretchy, but not clingy. Shimmery\u2014\nSuri Polomare: [simultaneously] Shimmery, but not showy. And the entire line is in the same adorable pattern. It works on everything from skirts to tops to shoes and, [chuckles]...\nPrim Hemline: Oh, bravo! I've never seen anything like it!\nRarity: You stole my fabric!\nSuri Polomare: [laughs] I didn't steal it, okay? You gave it to me, 'member?\nRarity: I gave you the fabric for accents! Not for your whole line! And how could you possibly make all of those outfits out of it so fast?!\nSuri Polomare: Fast? Hah! Coco Pommel here took practically forever. Nearly got me completely disqualified.\nCoco Pommel: Well, I wanted to make sure you'd win, so I took the extra time to\u2014\nSuri Polomare: Quiet! I pay an assistant to sew and get coffee, not talk. 'Kay?\nRarity: [gasps] How could this happen?\nSuri Polomare: Aw, sweetie, don't blame yourself. It takes some small-town fillies a while to learn it's everypony for herself in the big city, m'kay?\nRarity: [crying]\nSuri Polomare: Hope you realize how fortunate you are to have me as a mentor. Now get me some coffee!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, my gosh, what a great afternoon! That was almost too much fun!\nRainbow Dash: Better pace yourself, 'cause the rest of the day is jam-packed!\nApplejack: First there's the salon appointment to get our manes done.\nPinkie Pie: Then our fancy dinner at the Far-Afield Tavern!\nFluttershy: And after that...\nMain cast sans Spike: Hinny of the Hills! [laughing]\nRainbow Dash: Is... everything okay?\nPinkie Pie: You got the dresses the bellhop brought you and everything, right?\nRarity: [bawls]\nRainbow Dash: But he said he brought them.\nRarity: [crying] And then Suri stole them! [fast breathing] I let one of the other contestants use some of my one-of-a-kind fabric [fast breathing] and then she turned it into a wardrobe just like mine, [fast breathing] only now it looks like I'm the one copying her! My generosity has ruined me, I tell you! Ruined! [bawls]\nTwilight Sparkle: Now, Rarity, whatever went wrong, we're all here to help you get through it, no matter what it takes.\nRest of main cast sans Rarity: [general agreement]\nApplejack: Come on, Rarity, buck up! All we need is some fabric and you'll be back in business!\nRarity: [gasps] This new line is going to be marvelous! Perhaps even better than the last! It's daring, it's bold! Perhaps I still have a chance after all!\n\n[sewing machines whirring]\nRarity: Twilight! Sew these pieces together according to that pattern there!\nTwilight Sparkle: You said if we skipped dinner at the Far-Afield Tavern, you'd order a meal for us while we keep working.\nRarity: Don't fret. It'll be here in an hour. That's not going to be a problem, is it?\nRainbow Dash: Well, we're supposed to be watching Hinny of the Hills by then...\nRarity: Oh! I see! I go out of my way to get you tickets for a show, and this is how you repay me? By abandoning me in my hour of need? Oh, oh, oh! Fine! Go and see Hinny of the Hills tonight! And then tomorrow morning when you come to see my fashion show without any fashion to show, you can have more entertainment! \"Oh, why look, there's our friend Rarity going down in flames! Isn't friendship magic?!\"\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity, calm down. What's gotten into you?\nRarity: What's gotten into you?! Oh, go ahead! See your little show! Congratu-pony-lations, fillies! Sounds like you've all figured out already it's everypony for herself in this town!\n[door slams]\n[sewing machines whirring]\n\n[clicking]\nTwilight Sparkle: There. That's the last of them.\nRarity: [gasps] Finally!\nTwilight Sparkle: You're welcome!\n\nPrim Hemline: Let's have another round of applause for Suri Polomare's amazing collection.\n[ponies cheering]\nPrim Hemline: That fabric! So original!\nRarity: [sighs]\nSuri Polomare: [chuckles] Well look who's here. Here to show off your copycat collection, mm? Heh.\nPrim Hemline: And now, Rarity from Ponyville with her brand new line \u2013 and I mean \"brand new\" \u2013 Hotel Chic.\n[ponies talking excitedly]\n[cameras clicking]\nRarity: Oh! They're liking it! I think I may have just won this thing! Oh, I can't wait to celebrate with... My friends. They didn't come. What have I done?\n[ponies cheering]\n\n[cameras clicking]\nPrim Hemline: Rarity, they all adore you! Aren't you going to tell them about your fabulous pieces?\nRarity: I have to go.\nPrim Hemline: [gasps] Come back at once!\n[audience gasps]\nPrim Hemline: This is unheard of!\n\n\"Luggage Cart\": How do you do, ma'am? Contest going well?\nRarity: No time to talk. I have to find my friends!\n\"Luggage Cart\": Oh, uh, they're gone already. I saw them headed out this morning.\nRarity: Oh, no! Back to Ponyville, I imagine. Oh, they worked so hard on my behalf! And I repaid them with unkindness. What have I done?! Oh... here you are.\n\"Luggage Cart\": But miss, I\u2013 I didn't do anything!\n[thunder rumbling]\n\n[Rarity]\nOh, Manehattan, what have I done?\nThe thought of Fashion Week was fun\nBut I went way too far\nMy friends gave to me in ways so kind\nAnd I gave them nothing but a hard time\n\nOh, Manehattan, what have I done?\nThe thought of Fashion Week was fun\nBut I went way too far\nMy friends gave to me in ways so kind\nAnd I gave them nothing but a hard time\n\nAnd now alone I stand\nAnd now alone I stand\n[bell rings]\nRarity: I need a moment with Prim Hemline. I have to rush back to Ponyville, but I just wanted to thank her first for\u2014\nSuri Polomare: Uh-uh-uh, you'd best steer clear of Prim for a while. She's pretty furious. Isn't that right?\nCoco Pommel: Um... yes.\nPinkie Pie: [squee]\nRarity: There you all are! I can't believe it, I thought you went back home!\nTwilight Sparkle: We missed the show because we overslept. Suri told us you lost. I'm really sorry.\nRarity: I lost? You know what? I don't even care. I'm just happy you're all still here after how I treated you. Taking advantage of your friendship the way I did. How could you ever see past it?\nApplejack: Yeah, you were pretty rotten.\nRainbow Dash: Wow, Applejack. I know your thing is honesty, but come on!\nTwilight Sparkle: Last night we may not have seen you at your best, but we know you. And we would never let one thing like that change how we feel about you.\nRarity: Oh, thank you! You really are the most wonderful friends a pony could have! You know, I already arranged to make it up to you this afternoon! Hope you're all available for an exclusive performance of Hinny of the Hills!\nRest of main cast: [cheering]\nSuri Polomare: And that is how it's done. Pretty clever how I convinced her to stay away from Prim, wasn't it? [chuckles] Wouldn't have wanted her to find out the truth now, would we?\n\nAnd now alone I stand\nAnd now alone I stand\n\nHinny of the Hills: [singing] And I'm a dancing pony!\nMain cast: [cheering]\nApplejack: Wow! That was even better than I imagined!\nRainbow Dash: I loved it! [beat] Uh, I mean, it was a'ight.\nApplejack and Pinkie Pie: [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: How did you ever get them to agree to do an extra performance just for us?\nRarity: Remember my costume designer friend who got me the tickets? Well, I offered to make all the costumes for his next show!\nFluttershy: Um, here in Manehattan?\nRarity: Well, um... yes... it will keep me away from Ponyville for a while.\nRest of main cast: [sighs]\nRarity: But I so wanted you to see this show! And working for this designer is such a great opportunity!\nApplejack: We know. We're happy for you, Rarity. We're just sad for us.\nCoco Pommel: Mind if I join you?\nRarity: Sure. Come on down. This is the first place trophy for Fashion Week. [gasps] With my name on it! But I thought I lost!\nCoco Pommel: You didn't. You won. Suri was hoping that if you didn't claim your prize, the judges would consider it a forfeit and first place would go to her. So she lied to make you and your friends go away, and, well, I lied too. I've worked for Suri for so long, I started to believe that it really is everypony for herself in this town. Until I saw how generous you were with your friends and how generous they were with you. It made me start believing there was something better for me out there. So, I\u2013 I quit. I brought you something to say thank you.\nRarity: Hm. I suppose you'll need a job now that you're no longer with Suri. How would you like to work for my friend making all the costumes for his next show?\n\nRarity: Manehattan was simply grand. It was in this magnificent metropolis that I learned that, while there are ponies who will take advantage of your generosity, you should never, ever let that cause you to abandon your generous spirit. Nothing feels worse than taking advantage of the giving nature of your friends.\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nPinkie Pie: Whatcha doin'?\nTwilight Sparkle: Aaagh!\nPinkie Pie: \"Aaagh\" yourself!

I'd just hate for us to get all excited before we found out for sure.\nApple Bloom: So how are we supposed to find out for sure?\nGranny Smith: Ehhhh... Oh! Cousin Goldie Delicious!

I just wanted to say somethin' real quick.\nGranny Smith: I've had somethin' in my teeth this whole time, haven't I?

We did it!\nPinkie Pie: Say 'soaked'!\n[camera clicks]\n\nPinkie Pie: So what you're saying is, if I have the courage to jump, the parachute will open.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nPinkie Pie: Whoa! That is deep!\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nApplejack: Uh-oh... All right, y'all. Please tell me that the map didn' get wet. 'Cuz it looks like I'm gonna need it right about now.\nApple Bloom: Found it!\nWho's got the map?\nI got the map!\nM to the A to the yeah, that's right, P\nAin't no other pony found a map like me\nI'm Apple\u2014 uh-oh.\nApplejack: [gasp]\nEverypony: [screams]\n[splash, splash, camera clicks]\nApple Bloom: [laughs nervously]\nApplejack: [through gritted teeth] All you had to do was bring it to me. No singin', no dancin', no games. Just walk it over!\nBig McIntosh: [through gritted teeth] Eeyup.\nPinkie Pie: Say 'best siblings ever'!\n[camera clicks]\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, that's another keeper!\nGranny Smith: It's okay, y'all! I travelled down this river as a filly and I know it like the back of my hoof!\nApplejack: Are you sure you know which way to go?\nGranny Smith: Does a June bug like to hide in a tree?\nApplejack: Uh... I don't know.\nGranny Smith: Well, I do know! And I also know we wanna head southeast! Now step aside, young'un!\nApplejack: Um, Granny?\nGranny Smith: Myuh-huh?\nApplejack: Are we supposed to go through a cave?\nGranny Smith: Ah, don't worry, child! The scariest cave in Equestria was down that other way!\nApple Bloom: The scariest cave in Equestria?\nGranny Smith: Oh, it's a fright all right! Filled with creatures that'll eat ya soon as look at ya!\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, sounds scary. Tell us more!\nGranny Smith: Ponies go in... but they never come out!\nApplejack: And you're sure it's not that cave? The one we're headin' straight for?\nGranny Smith: Now, Applejack, I taught you better than to question your elder ponies!\nPinkie Pie: [squee]\nApplejack: Heh... you sure did.\nGranny Smith: Alrighty then. Now everypony just sit on back an' leave the steerin' to your old Granny Smith.\nApplejack: [gulp]\nGranny Smith: See now? Told ya th--\n[roaring]\nApple family: [screaming]\n[camera clicks]\nPinkie Pie: Got it! Best scary unidentifiable creature ever! Say 'terrified'!\nApple family: [continue screaming]\n[camera clicks]\nPinkie Pie: [hums]\nGranny Smith: Guess that was the scariest cave in Equestria. Uh, of course I meant to take us through it! Unexpected adventure is good for the soul!\nPinkie Pie: Best granny wisdom ever!\nApplejack: Uh-huh. Why don't you just scooch on over there, Granny? Think I'll take it from here on out.\nGranny Smith: Huh! Is that how I taught you to treat your elder ponies?\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! Ooh! Is it?\nApplejack: You taught me to trust my common sense. And my common sense says we should get to Goldie Delicious's cabin in one piece.\nGranny Smith: And that is exactly what I'm gonna do!\nApplejack: That is mighty generous of you, but I think you've done enough for one day.\nGranny Smith: And how exactly are you gonna know which way to go?\nPinkie Pie: Hmmmmmmm?\nApplejack: It would be easier if the map hadn't gone overboard!\nApple Bloom: Hey! There wouldn't have been an overboard if Big Mac hadn't overpacked the jalopy!\nBig McIntosh: Eeyu- hey!\nApplejack: Exactly! So I think we can all agree that from here on out, I should be in charge of everythin'.\nApple family: [arguing]\n[splash, duck quacks, eagle cries]\nApplejack: [laughs nervously]\nPinkie Pie: I just wanna say... that I think you're all super duper, and I can't wait to make a page in my scrapbook about the amazing waterfall we went down!\n[water rushing]\n[duck quacks]\nApple family: [panicked cries] [screams]\n\nWho's got the map?\nI got the map!\nM to the A to the yeah, that's right, P\nAin't no other pony found a map like me\nI'm Apple\u2014 uh-oh.\n\nApple family: [screams]\nPinkie Pie: Wheeeee!\n[camera clicks]\n[splash]\nGranny Smith: Huh! Told you that sugar pine sap would hold this thing together.\n[crunch]\nApple family: [yelps]\n[balloons pop]\nPinkie Pie: [yelps]\n\nApple family: [groaning]\nPinkie Pie: We're here! We're here! We made it to Goldie Delicious's's's's's! You guys! There's a note! [giggles]\nApplejack: Uh, Pinkie Pie? Maybe you could read that one out loud?\nPinkie Pie: Oh, right, sorry! I haven't even read it yet. I was just looking at how pretty the paper is. Okay, it says that she ran off to run some errands but will be home soon! Oh, that's perfect!\nApple Bloom: Why is that perfect?\nPinkie Pie: Because it'll give me enough time to get more scrapbook paper! See ya!\nApple Bloom: Worst family road trip. Ever.\nBig McIntosh: [sadly] Eeyup.\nApplejack: I can't believe she witnessed our family fallin' apart like this. [sighs] I can't believe I was arguin' with you so much that I tore the wheel right off the raft. It's like I wasn't myself at all.\nGranny Smith: Aw, that wasn't your fault. My stubborn streak got a hold of me somethin' fierce. Should've let you take the wheel long a'fore that.\nApple Bloom: It was my fault the map got all wet...\nBig McIntosh: I was the pony who\u2014\nGranny Smith: Now, now, Big Mac, you gotta know we forgive you for packin' the jalopy so much that it collapsed. You was just as eager to please Pinkie Pie like the rest of us.\nApplejack: Everypony, I think we have to let Pinkie Pie know that even if she does discover that she's an Apple, she does not have to feel obliged to consider herself one.\nGranny Smith: Sure as applesauce.\nPinkie Pie: Are you kidding me?! You guys are the best family ever!\nApplejack: How can you say that? We started out as one big unit, and now look at us.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! Now look at you! You're all here still in one big unit, loving each other and owning up to what went wrong! You never gave up, even when things got tough!\nApple Bloom: She does make a pretty good point.\nPinkie Pie: You aren't just family, you're best friends! And I wanna be an Apple more than ever!\nApple Bloom: And we want you to be one too!\nPinkie Pie: Yippee! [giggles]\nGoldie Delicious: Now that's how you run an errand.\nPinkie Pie: Hello!\nGoldie Delicious: Hello yourself!\nApplejack: You must be Goldie Delicious. So nice to meet you.\nGoldie Delicious: Uh-huh. And who exactly are you?\nPinkie Pie: We're Apples!\nApplejack: Well, we think we're all Apples. But we need your help finding out if Pinkie Pie here is our fourth cousin twice removed.\nGoldie Delicious: Well why didn't you say so? If anypony can help solve this genealogy mystery, it's me!\n[door creaking]\nGoldie Delicious: [straining] Oh, I am sorry about this. I wasn't exactly expectin' company. Lemme try to squeeze in here... [straining]\n[cats complaining]\nGoldie Delicious: Gotta... get some oil... for the hinges...\n[crashing, cat noises]\nGoldie Delicious: Alrighty then, just have to move a few things out of the way of the door. Ooh! Ah! Get off of that, Mr. Fluffy... Come on, Pooples... come here, sweetheart... Come on in! Sorry about the mess!\n[cats meowing]\nApplejack: Whoa!\nGoldie Delicious: Oh, careful now. Those belonged to your great-great-great-great uncle Apple Tart!\nApple Bloom: Well, whose was this?\nGoldie Delicious: Well, that was my lunch. A couple of weeks ago.\n[cats purring]\nGoldie Delicious: [puffs] [straining] This here is a complete record of, of our family tree! It's not here, or here, or, or here, or it certainly isn't here, is it...? Oh, here it is! ...Oh, dear.\nGranny Smith: 'Oh, dear'? What is it?\nPinkie Pie: Am I not an Apple after all?\nGoldie Delicious: Well, that's just it. I don't know. The page is all smudged. I sure am sorry, but I don't think I can help you out after all.\nPinkie Pie: Don't be sorry, it's okay. I'm just a little disappointed that I'll never know for sure if I'm a part of this family.\nApplejack: Well, I know for sure!\nPinkie Pie: What do you mean? You can't know!\nApplejack: I can know for sure that it doesn't matter what the book says or doesn't say. After all you've been through with us and all you've put up with, it's obvious you're an Apple to the core!\nGranny Smith: Darn tootin'!\nApple Bloom: Yes siree!\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! Say 'best family hug ever'!\nApple family: Best family hug ever!\n[camera clicks]\n\nApplejack: Thanks again for the wagon, Goldie! We'll see you soon!\nGoldie Delicious: Y'all sure you don't want to take any of these Apple family heirlooms home with you?\n[crash]\n[cat mews]\nBig McIntosh: Nnope.\n\n\n[All]\nWe're Apples forever, Apples together\nWe're family, but so much more\nNo matter what comes, we will face the weather\nWe're Apples to the core!\n\nWe're Apples forever, Apples together\nWe're family, but so much more\nNo matter what comes, we will face the weather\nWe're Apples to the core!\n\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\n\nApplejack: Twilight agreed this was definitely an experience worth puttin' in the journal. Think I'll write about how bein' a good family isn't about bein' perfect as much as it is about bein' able to get through the rough patches together. About bein' able to forgive each other for mistakes.\nApple Bloom: Don't forget to mention how really good friends can also feel like your family.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nApple Bloom: You know what? Maybe I should write it. I'm good at makin' things sound excitin'.\nGranny Smith: I have a history of excellent storytellin'. I should probably do it\u2014 Hey! Where in the haystack do you think you're goin' with that there pen?!\nBig McIntosh: I'm goin' to do- [voice drowned out]\nApple family: [arguing]\nPinkie Pie: [to the viewers] Look at me!

I'm all muscles! Yeah!\nRainbow Dash: I like your attitude, Bulk Biceps, but it's gonna take more than muscles and Yeah!s to get us to the Equestria Games! We are the Aerial Relay team, and it's up to the three of us to make sure that we qualify at the tryouts. And do I need to remind you how much I\u2014 I mean, Ponyville, heh, wants to qualify and make it to the Games?\nFluttershy: I remember. I really, really, really want to qualify for you and Ponyville.\nBulk Biceps: Bring it on!\nPinkie Pie: Gimme a 'P' for 'Ponyville'!\nFluttershy: [yelps]\nPinkie Pie: [through megaphone] P, Ponyville!\nBulk Biceps: P!\nFluttershy: Oh, thanks, Pinkie Pie.

They're perfect.\nPinkie Pie: 'P' is for 'perfect'!\nBulk Biceps and Fluttershy: [chewing]\nRainbow Dash: Alright, team! Show me what you got! Put some bend into those knees! Flap those wings!

Sorry we couldn't fly with you on the Aerial Relay, but the air sprinters needed us too.\nThunderlane: Too bad we can only compete in one event. [sighs] But rules are rules.\nTwilight Sparkle: Good luck! [to Rainbow Dash] It was nice of you to be part of the team that doesn't have... uh... the strongest flyers.\nRainbow Dash: Nothing nice about it. I know that I can pick up the slack for anypony. With me on the team, we'll qualify. I'm sure of it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ponyville is very lucky to have you.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, I'm pretty awesome.\nFluttershy: [straining] [gasping] I am so proud to be representing Ponyville. [straining] Oh, it's such an honor to even try out for the Games. I just hope I don't let anypony down.\nBulk Biceps: We'll make them proud!\nPinkie Pie: 'P' is for 'proud'! We're gonna be the best fans anypony has ever seen!\nRarity: Ooh. Can't wait to see what everypony else is wearing, even though I am absolutely sure they won't be better than the Ponyville uniforms I'm designing for the Equestria Games.\nApplejack: And we will make it to the Games once everypony carbo-loads on my apple brown bettys.\nPinkie Pie: I can't wait!\n[train engine sounds]\n\nPonies: [excited chattering, groaning]\nMane Moon: There's Rainbow Dash! She's an awesome flyer!\nOrange Swirl: I heard that she's flying the last third of the relay, which means everypony else is gonna have to be way ahead to beat her!\n[distant boom]\nMane Moon: Oh, the Wonderbolts!\nSprinkle Medley: I hear they're flying for Cloudsdale.\nOrange Swirl: Then Cloudsdale will definitely qualify. They're the best flyers ever.\nSpitfire: And the game is on!\nSoarin: Hah, nice to see there's some real competition here!\nFleetfoot: Two more days of practice, then we'll see you in the air, Rainbow Dash! If you're lucky.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] The Wonderbolts know a winner when they see one, and we'll be winners just as soon as we practice! Right team?\nFluttershy: Right.\nBulk Biceps: Yeah!\nPinkie Pie: Hooray! [blows party hooter]\n[beat]\nTwilight Sparkle: And, um, I'm with her! Hooray!\nCloudsdale cheerleaders: Give us some clouds! Give us some dale! And what do you get? Cloudsdale! Woo-hoo!\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] Where can I get pompoms like those?!\n\nRainbow Dash: So, do I need to remind you of what our goal is here?\nBulk Biceps: Uh, maybe?\nRainbow Dash: We want to qualify! We need to be one of the first four teams to cross the finish line! Bulk Biceps, you're the first flyer, so let me see you flap it!\nBulk Biceps: [grunts]\n[splat]\nRainbow Dash: What the?\nApplejack: Sorry! Got the idea from them, but...\nRainbowshine and Sprinkle Medley: Hooves down! Cakes up!\nFleetfoot and Spitfire: [chewing]\nApplejack: ...It looks like they got better aim.\nRainbow Dash: Okay, the passing of the baton needs to be seamless. You shouldn't miss a wing beat or drop a hair in altitude! And whatever you do, don't let go of it!\nFluttershy: Are you really, really, really sure you're ready? I mean, I don't want to take it if you're not super sure.\nBulk Biceps: Ready!\n[clink, thud]\nRarity: Ponyville could do so much better. I'll be back with a freshly painted one in no time!\nRainbow Dash: We were using that! And it's not like anypony else has color-coordinated horseshoes or anything!\n[clink]\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] I guess some ponies do.\nTwilight Sparkle: Some ponies do what?\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Have a better chance of qualifying and going to the Equestria Games than others.\n\nRainbow Dash: Watch and learn. The Cloudsdales are Wonderbolts, and Wonderbolts are the best flyers there are. And my personal heroes. So, maybe you can learn something.\n[jet engine sounds]\nRainbow Dash: Please learn something?\nFleetfoot: C'mon, Soarin, pick up the pace! You can do better than that!\nSpitfire: I sure hope so.\nCloudsdale cheerleaders: Practice, practice, yay, practice!\nSoarin: Whoa!\n[sound of plane plummeting]\nSoarin: Whooaaaa!\n\nSoarin: Aaaaah! Help!\nRainbow Dash: Gotcha!\nWonderbolts and Ponyville team: [excited cheering]\nFleetfoot: Awe-some!\nSpitfire: As good as any Wonderbolt!\nFluttershy: Oh, Rainbow Dash, I'm just so proud of you. You scooped Soarin out of the sky and brought him down to the ground and now, now he's okay. At least, I hope he's okay. [to Soarin] Are you okay?\nSoarin: Uh, my wing hurts, but I-I'm sure it'll be okay by the competition.\n[siren wailing]\nSoarin: You're the best, Rainbow Dash. [groans]\nRainbow Dash: Ah, it was nothin'. But, if you feel like talking about how great I am, don't let me stop you!\n[siren wailing]\nBulk Biceps: 'P' is for Rainbow Dash!\nFluttershy: [whispering] Um, 'Rainbow Dash' actually starts with an 'R'.\nBulk Biceps: Never mind!\nRainbow Dash: Tough break to lose a teammate right before the tryouts.\nFleetfoot: You know, you grew up in Cloudsdale.\nSpitfire: So that means you could fly with us.\nRainbow Dash: Fly?\nFleetfoot: Uh, we mean practice. You could practice with us until Soarin's better.\nSpitfire: What do you say? Wanna be our third?\nRainbow Dash: Uh, I don't know. My team really needs me to be at my best in order to qualify. Don't wanna be too worn out by the time the race comes around.\nSpitfire: We put you through some pretty intense workouts at the Wonderbolt Academy and you handled those just fine.\nRainbow Dash: Heh, I did kick some major tail at the Academy... but I don't know how my teammates will feel about me practicing with the competition.\nFleetfoot: Who says they need to know? Think about it, Rainbow Dash! This is your chance to fly with the winners!\nBulk Biceps: [flexing muscles]\nRainbow Dash: Alright, I'll do it.\nSpitfire: [chuckles] Wise decision, Rainbow Dash.\n\n[training montage music]\n[clink]\nFleetfoot: Awesome!\nCloudsdale cheerleaders: Whinny, ponies, whinny! Fly on, fly on, fly on!\n\nBulk Biceps: [grunting]\nRainbow Dash: Come on, Bulk Biceps, you can do it!\n[creaking]\nFluttershy: Um... I'm ready to take the horseshoe, if you want me to.\n[clink]\nBulk Biceps and Fluttershy: [screaming]\n[distant crash]\nRainbow Dash: Nnnngh...\n\n[training montage music]\n[squeaking]\n\nFluttershy: [yelps] Oof!\nRainbow Dash: You, uh, keep doing your wing-ups.

Does anypony else?\nTwilight Sparkle: No. They're too busy practicing to wonder why you keep disappearing.\nRainbow Dash: Well, I've seen the other teams practicing and we're still gonna qualify. I can fly fast enough to make up the distance.\nTwilight Sparkle: It just seems like one of the teams you're practicing with needs a little more help than the other one.\nRainbow Dash: But it's so much more fun working out with the winners than... um... the non-winners. Besides, Ponyville will still qualify.\nSpitfire: Rainbow Dash, you got a minute?\nRainbow Dash: Uh, sure.\nFleetfoot: You could really be an asset to our team, so... we want you to join the Cloudsdale team. Permanently.\nRainbow Dash: [gasps]\nSpitfire: It looks like Soarin's wing won't heal in time for the trials. We want you to fly with us.\nFleetfoot: Of course, this means you won't be able to fly for Ponyville, but let's face it. Even with you on their team, their chances of qualifying for the Games\u2014\nBulk Biceps: Ow!\nFleetfoot: \u2014are pretty slim.\nBulk Biceps: [whimpering]\nSpitfire: So, what's it gonna be?\nRainbow Dash: Well, I...\nSpitfire: Take some time to think about it.\nRainbow Dash: They want me to fly with them! It's like a dream come true!\nTwilight Sparkle: If you fly for Cloudsdale, Pinkie Pie won't have anypony to cheer for. Rarity's uniforms will never be seen. And Applejack will have slaved over those apple brown bettys for nothing.\nRainbow Dash: Oh, but I really wanna fly with the best team! What would you do?\nTwilight Sparkle: I think this is a decision you have to make on your own. The race is tomorrow, so you'd better make it soon.\n\n[anemometer spinning]\nRainbow Dash: [exaggerated groaning] Woe is me! Oooh!\nCrowd: [concerned chattering]\nFluttershy: What's happened?\nRainbow Dash: Urgh, I've hurt my hoof...\nPinkie Pie and Rarity: [gasps]\nSpitfire: All of them?\nRainbow Dash: I, uh, tripped on a-a foam hoof and landed on a... [mumbles, near unintelligible] pokey stick coming out of the ground...\nPinkie Pie: [growls] If I get my hooves on that [matching unintelligible gibberish], it'll be in big trouble!\nRainbow Dash: There is no way I can fly now.\nFluttershy: Do you think you'll be better by tryouts?\nRainbow Dash: [exaggerated groaning] I'll be lucky if I ever fly again! [sighs] I just need a little rest.\nFluttershy: Oh, don't worry, Rainbow Dash. We'll take care of you... or, at least, somepony will. Like, a medic or-or a doctor, or a nurse.\n\n[EKG beeping]\nTwilight Sparkle: So, the medic pony isn't sure what's wrong with you.\nRainbow Dash: Everything! Absolutely everything!\nApplejack: This'll cure everythin' that ails ya!\nRainbow Dash: [with mouth full] Thank you. I couldn't have done that on my own.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\nRarity: Nothing says 'get better' like a little medical pizazz! Silk slings and a glitter bandage?\nRainbow Dash: That might help.\n[door opens]\nFluttershy: And how is our patient doing?\n[thud]\nBulk Biceps: [neighs]\nRainbow Dash: I've been better.\nFluttershy: We just wanted to let you know that we're so sorry you're hurt, but you shouldn't worry a bit about not being able to be in the tryouts. We'll be alright. We even have a replacement. We're so, so sorry that you can't compete. We all know how much you love to fly. And we promise\u2014\nBulk Biceps: Cross our hearts!\nFluttershy: ...That if we qualify and make it to the Equestria Games and all win gold medals, you can have ours, because we know how much a gold medal means to you.\nRainbow Dash: Thanks...\nTwilight Sparkle: [clears throat] I think Rainbow Dash might need to rest some more.\nRest of main cast: [chattering]\nApplejack: Don't forget your bettys!\nTwilight Sparkle: You know, choosing not to choose isn't really a decision.\nSoarin: You sure have nice friends. Nopony's been by to visit me. Eh, too busy practicing, I guess.\nRainbow Dash: Well, hopefully your wing will be better soon.\nSoarin: Oh, it's fine. I-I'm just keeping it warm in case my team wants me back.\nRainbow Dash: What do you mean, 'wants you back'? Spitfire and Fleetfoot told me that you were still too injured to fly!\nSoarin: And they told me that they were worried I wouldn't be one hundred percent by the tryouts, so they were going with somepony else!\nRainbow Dash: That somepony else was me! Until, uh, well, until I got hurt, that is.\nSoarin: So, [sighs] I guess we're all out of luck. Cloudsdale won't qualify without three fliers, and Ponyville won't qualify without you. Too bad...\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Even with Rainbow Dash's replacement, I don't think we're gonna qualify. No offense.\nPinkie Pie: Gah! What am I gonna do with all these now?!\nApplejack: Uh, what were you gonna do with them before?\nRarity: [sighs] Maybe my Equestria Games uniforms will still be in style next year. I mean, I am pretty fashion-forward.\n[hoofbeats]\nTwilight Sparkle: Is that Rainbow Dash... walking?\nSpitfire: [drinking water]\nFleetfoot: Does... this mean you're feeling better?\nRainbow Dash: I-I feel great, because... I was never hurt in the first place.\nWonderbolts: [gasps]\nBulk Biceps, Fluttershy and Derpy: [gasps]\nRainbow Dash: I faked my injury so that I wouldn't have to choose between flying for Ponyville or Cloudsdale. I wanted to fly with you both, and the decision was too hard!\nFluttershy: Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to choose us. I know you love to win, and you should go with the team that surely will.\nRainbow Dash: I know now who I should've been loyal to.\nSpitfire: Good choice. Always stick with the winners.\nRainbow Dash: Ponyville. Because it's not just where I live, but it's where my friends are. The ponies who really care about me, whether I can help them win a race or not.\nRest of main cast and Derpy: [cheering]\nSpitfire: Are you sure that's the right decision?\nRainbow Dash: You lied to me about Soarin's wing just so you could get a better flyer! You may be a winning team, but you're still not the kind of team I wanna be a part of.\nSpitfire: Huh. Rainbow Dash, you are something. Saw it at the Academy, seeing it again here. We could learn a lot from a competitor like you.\nFleetfoot: Think we already have.\nSpitfire: Ready to fly?\nSoarin: Really?\nSpitfire: Never should've lied and tried to replace you to begin with.\nSoarin: [gasps] Go, Cloudsdale!\nRainbow Dash: Come on, Ponyville relay team! We've got a race to get ready for!\nBulk Biceps: Yeah!\n\n[click]\nSoarin: Come on, Ponyville!

I'll never forget youuuuuuu! [beat] Ooh, something floaty! La-la-la-la-la!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, I'm a bit nervous about Cadance's visit!\nApplejack: What could you be nervous about, Twilight? Cadance just loves you to pieces!\nTwilight Sparkle: I know, but I really want her visit to go without a hitch!\nPinkie Pie: Oh, why wouldn't it?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, the last three times we've seen each other haven't exactly been worry-free.\nRarity: The fate of Equestria has hung in the balance during most of your visits with her.\nTwilight Sparkle: Exactly. Cadance and I haven't really had a chance to just enjoy being friends again. Which is why it is so important that this visit be about the two of us having some real quality time together.\nApplejack: I'm guessin' you've got a plan that'll keep it that way.\nTwilight Sparkle: The timing couldn't be more perfect. For one day only, right here in Ponyville, the Star Swirl the Bearded Traveling Museum! Cadance and I can spend the whole day looking at Star Swirl the Bearded artifacts!\nRarity: Sounds like a perfect drama-free way to spend the day with Cadance.\nTwilight Sparkle: Not counting the drama surrounding which of the bells from his cloak they've chosen to put on display. Spoiler alert: it's this one!\nRainbow Dash: [hacks] Uh, sorry. Something in my throat... like a big ball of 'lame'!\nRarity: I think it sounds delightful.\nApplejack: Yup, definitely sounds like you two will have some real quality time together.\nTwilight Sparkle: Exactly. Just quiet time.\n[train whistle blows loudly]\n[loud train engine noises]\n[fanfare]\nPrincess Cadance: Your Highness.\nTwilight Sparkle: Your Highness.\nPrincess Cadance: I'm teasing, Twilight. We're sisters-in-law. We don't have to be so formal.\n[train whistle blows]\n[train engine noises]\nPrincess Cadance: Knowing you, you've made some plans.\nTwilight Sparkle: Boy, have I. Hang on just one second. [to rest of main cast] You guys-\nRarity: Now, now, don't you worry about a thing! We will make sure that nothing \u2013 but nothing \u2013 interferes with your visit.\nApplejack: Go on, have a hootenanny with your kinfolk.\nTwilight Sparkle: You really are the best friends a pony could ever have. Coming, Cadance!\nPinkie Pie: [sighs] Two sisters-in-law bonding. Well, I for one am gonna make sure that nothing spoils their day!\n[something whistling in the distance]\nApplejack: What is that thing?\nRarity: Whatever it is... duuuck!!!\nPinkie Pie: Rarity, that doesn't look anything like a duck!\n[crash]\nRainbow Dash: What is that?\nDiscord: [sniffing] No, not a \"what\", but a \"who\", dear.\nRainbow Dash: Oh, no... That sounds like...\nDiscord: [sneezes] [sniffs] Oh...\nApplejack, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity: Discord!\n\nApplejack: What in tarnation are you doin' here? And why the jumpin' June bugs are you blue?\nRarity: More like a shade of cerulean, to be precise.\nRainbow Dash: Whatever color you are is the color of trouble!\nDiscord: Oh, Rainbow Dash, I've changed, surely you remember? I was reformed by lovely little- [starts snorting] F-F-Fluttershy- [sneezes]\nApplejack: What are you, sick or somethin'?\nDiscord: Well, of course I'm sick. The blue skin? These sneezes? Could somebody find me a fainting couch?\n[beat]\nRarity: What?\nDiscord: How charming, thank you. I can't stop sneezing and wheezing. In short... I need help. [whines]\nRainbow Dash: If you're so 'sick', why have you come here instead of, y'know, staying home in bed and getting over your weird illness?\nDiscord: [sneezes] [blows nose] Because this condition has left me helpless, simply helpless! Why, I can barely lift a spoon.\n[clang]\nDiscord: I came to find the one pony who truly understands me and could nurse me back to health. Where is that dear, sweet Fluttershy? I need attention! I need some care! I need-\nRainbow Dash: You need to chill. Fluttershy's out.\nDiscord: Oh, of course, her trip to see the Breezies. Ah, yes, I had forgotten that was today.\nApplejack: How do you know about her trip?\nDiscord: Well, she told me about it in her last letter.\nPinkie Pie: You and Fluttershy write each other letters?\nDiscord: Well, of course we do! We're friends! It's just such a shame that today of all days is when I really need her. Oh, well, I know what to do.\nRainbow Dash: Good thinking. Head on home, put your feet up. I'm sure eventually you'll have the strength to make yourself soup or something...\nDiscord: Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no! I mean, while she's gone, you ponies can take care of me! Isn't that what friends are for, taking care of each other? [laughs] Let the healing begin!\nRainbow Dash: Not it!\nDiscord: Well, that's some way to treat a suffering friend. [sneezes]\nPinkie Pie: Don't you worry, Discord! I'll give you cuddles, and read you stories, and tell you all about me! I was born on a Tuesday-\nDiscord: Oh, you're so sweet to offer, but Rarity and Applejack already volunteered to be my own personal nursemaids. [chuckles]\nApplejack and Rarity: We did?\nDiscord: I so hope you don't mind, Pinkie Pie.\nPinkie Pie: Well, as a matter of fact, I most certainly- Hey! Who keeps throwing away these perfectly good balloons?\nApplejack: [hushed] That joker's up to something, and whatever it is, we're gonna keep it as far away from Twilight and Princess Cadance as possible.\n[ECG beeping]\nRarity: [hushed] You're right. We promised we wouldn't let anything ruin their visit... although I do so wish that \"anything\" had turned out to be something else!\nDiscord: Did I hear you two talking about Princess Cadance's visit with Princess Twilight?\nApplejack: Maybe.\nDiscord: Fluttershy had mentioned that those two were getting together today. Mm-hm. How wonderful for them both. It is so rare that those two get to see one another. I don't know about you, but I sometimes wonder how close they could actually be. All those years apart before being reunited?\nApplejack: They're plenty close.\nDiscord: And if they're not, this rare opportunity to focus on their friendship will certainly bring them closer. Unless...\nRarity: Don't even think about it! They mustn't be disturbed!\nDiscord: Disturb them? I wouldn't dream of it. Not when I have two such dear friends of my own who have already offered to take care of me. And at such peril! This flu of mine is highly- [snorts] [sneezes] contagious.\nApplejack and Rarity: [sneezes]\n[crash]\nDiscord: Oh no, I've gotten you both sick. Whomever shall I turn to now in my time of need? [chuckles]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: A whole day to celebrate Star Swirl the Bearded. What could be better?\nPrincess Cadance: Absolutely nothing. [gasps] Is that the candlestick he used to light the way when he was exploring the caverns of Maretania?\nTwilight Sparkle: It sure is!\nPrincess Cadance: Oh, I can't believe I'm getting to see it in real life!\n[rattling]\nPrincess Cadance and Twilight Sparkle: [yelps]\nDiscord: [sneezes]\nTwilight Sparkle: Discord! What are you doing here?!\nDiscord: Oh, dear, dear Princesses, I'm sorry to say that I'm sick. [hacks] Blue flu.\nPrincess Cadance: Blue flu?\nDiscord: Ah, I fear I've already given it to poor Applejack and Rarity. [sneezes]\nPrincess Cadance: Magic health bubble.\nTwilight Sparkle: Good thinking.\nDiscord: Indeed. How would Twilight nurse me back to health if she were sick too? You will be letting me stay at your place until I'm all better, won't you?\nTwilight Sparkle: Stay? With me?! Uh, now is not really the best time, though I'm sure you already knew that...\nDiscord: But taking in the sick and the desperate - isn't that what Fluttershy would do? Isn't 'helping' something that friends do for friends? Unless, of course, you're really saying that you're not my friend.\nTwilight Sparkle: [through gritted teeth] No, that is not what I'm saying.\nDiscord: Oh, how elated I am to hear that. Shall the three of us head back to your place? I don't want to get anypony else sick.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Guess we don't have much choice.\nDiscord: Carry me?\nPrincess Cadance: It isn't far. I think you can manage.\nDiscord: Oh, poo.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Need anything else?\nDiscord: Just knowing that I have a good friend like you to take care of me has made me feel better already. I'll be fine here on my own. Oh, just before you go, just a little small request.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\nPrincess Cadance: It's going to be fine. We'll just get him what he wants and be back to the exhibit in no time. What was it that you needed?\n\n[Discord]\nA little glass of water please\nA fresh pressed hanky if I sneeze\nSome tea with honey from the bees\nWhenever you can brew it\n\nA little glass of water please\nA fresh pressed hanky if I sneeze\nSome tea with honey from the bees\nWhenever you can brew it\n\nPrincess Cadance: I'll get your tea.\n\n[Discord]\nAnd while I get a little rest\nA teeny tiny small request\nSome codfish oil for my chest\nPoured from a crystal cruet\n\nAnd while I get a little rest\nA teeny tiny small request\nSome codfish oil for my chest\nPoured from a crystal cruet\n\nTwilight Sparkle: A crystal cruet?\n\n[Discord]\n[singing faster]\nMy goodness, I'm a nincompoop\nBecause I fear I've got the croup\nI need a vat of pumpkin soup\nAnd scarves made out of zinnias\n\n[singing faster]\nMy goodness, I'm a nincompoop\nBecause I fear I've got the croup\nI need a vat of pumpkin soup\nAnd scarves made out of zinnias\n\nDid I say zinnias?

Sorry. [sneezes]\nTwilight Sparkle: Alright, this is ridiculous!\nPrincess Cadance: How did you even catch this flu?\nDiscord: Inadequate hoof and claw washing?\nTwilight Sparkle: There must be some way to just cure you! There has to be a spell or remedy in one of my books!\nDiscord: There is one way...\nPrincess Cadance: And you didn't think to mention it earlier?\nDiscord: Slipped my mind. On a hill at the very edge of Equestria, there grows an exquisite magic flower. Pick the flower as it drops its petals at sunset. Then you can make a magical soothing elixir to cure the blue flu.\nTwilight Sparkle: I suppose you have a good reason you didn't bother to get this flower as soon as you realized you were sick?\nDiscord: Well, I couldn't travel that far in my condition. By the time I got there, I'd be too weak to even attempt to retrieve the flower.\nTwilight Sparkle: So where exactly are Cadance and I headed?\nDiscord: Well, [clears throat] you'll want to head north, turn left, th\u2014 Oh... You know, it'd be much easier if I took you there myself.\nPrincess Cadance: I thought you were in no condition to travel.\nDiscord: I'm not. We'll need to make some arrangements. [chuckles]\n\nMake sure I'm drinking in the right\nAmount of fluids day and night\nI wish I may, I wish I might\nHave just one little thing\nOh, would you please finally bring\nMe that tiny glass\nOf water?!!\n\nPrincess Cadance: [straining]\nTwilight Sparkle: Doing okay there?\nPrincess Cadance: To be honest, I'm a little out of practice when it comes to flying.\nDiscord: Well, then lucky for you. We're here.\n[thud]\nDiscord: It's just at the top of that hill.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm really sorry about this. All I wanted was to have some peaceful quality time together.\nPrincess Cadance: I know, I was looking forward to it too.\n[eagle screeches]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: This is the top. But where is that flower? Oh. Come on, if we hurry, we can still have some time together.\n[cracking]\nPrincess Cadance: One... last... pull!\nPrincess Cadance and Twilight Sparkle: [straining]\nTwilight Sparkle: Phew! Let's get Discord and this flower back home, then all our problems are solved-\nPrincess Cadance: What in Equestria?!\nTatzlwurm: [roars]\nPrincess Cadance and Twilight Sparkle: [screaming]\nTatzlwurm: [roars]\nPrincess Cadance: Twilight! Help!\nTwilight Sparkle: Get your coils off my sister-in-law!\n[thud]\nTatzlwurm: [roars]\nTwilight Sparkle: [yelps]\nPrincess Cadance: [gasps]\nTwilight Sparkle: [screams]\nPrincess Cadance: Let go of my sister-in-law!\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks!\nPrincess Cadance: Don't thank me yet!\nTatzlwurm: [roars]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\n[magic zapping, Tatzlwurm roaring]\nTwilight Sparkle: Just... a little... more!\nTatzlwurm: [roars] [Wilhelm scream]\nPrincess Cadance: And for good measure...!\n[thud, crashing]\nTwilight Sparkle: [panting] Are you okay?\nPrincess Cadance: [panting] Yes. Better than okay actually.\nTwilight Sparkle: Then let's get Discord back to Ponyville, make that elixir, and finally get a chance to spend some quality time together.\n\nDiscord: To the ends of Equestria! To face such great danger! And she did it for me! She did it all for me, for me, for me! [laughs]\nTwilight Sparkle: You... were... faking?!\nDiscord: I was! But I had a very good reason.\nTwilight Sparkle: We're listening.\nDiscord: Well, I was in my thinking tree \u2013 that's where I do most of my really deep thinking \u2013 I was there, and I said to myself, I said, \"Discord, your friend Twilight says that she's your pal, but she never writes and she never pops in for a visit.\"\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't even know where you li-\nDiscord: \"Now that she's a princess, maybe she's decided that she's too good for you.\"\nTwilight Sparkle: I have never considered myself t-\nDiscord: But how was I supposed to know for sure that I'm truly still friends with one of the most important ponies around?\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm not more-\nDiscord: By seeing if you would go to the ends of Equestria for me, of course. Which you did, literally. Congratulations, Twilight, you passed my friendship test!\n[clink]\nDiscord: Why the angry eyes? You love passing tests. It's not because my little exam put a damper on your visit with Princess Cadance, is it? Made it so that there was no time for you two to focus on your friendship?\nPrincess Cadance: You didn't put a damper on our visit at all.\n\n\n\n\nTwilight Sparkle:\nHe didn't?!\n\n\nDiscord:\nI didn't?!\n\n\nTwilight Sparkle:\nHe didn't?!\n\nDiscord:\nI didn't?!\n\nPrincess Cadance: Spending the day at the Star Swirl the Bearded exhibit would've been more relaxing, but to be honest, relaxation is the last thing I need.\nTwilight Sparkle: It is?\nPrincess Cadance: Don't get me wrong. Life in the Crystal Empire is wonderful, but it's become a little... predictable. I enjoy a little excitement now and then. Getting to face all these challenges today was just what I needed. And facing them with you just made me realize even more how lucky I am to have somepony like you as a friend. We may not see each other very often, but I know you'll always be there when I need you. Just like she was there for you, Discord.\nDiscord: Yes, she's a real sweetheart. We're all so lucky to have her in our lives.\n[rumbling]\nTatzlwurm: [roars]\nDiscord: What in the world?!\nTatzlwurm: [spits]\n[popping]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I think it's pretty clear that my visit with Cadance didn't go quite the way I expected. But in the end, I realized that when you're with a good friend, even the most chaotic day can end up being a great experience that brings you closer. Wouldn't you agree, Discord?\nDiscord: [snorts] Yes, Twilight.\nApplejack: I don't wanna go sayin' you got what you deserved...\nRarity: Well, I have no trouble saying it. You got what you deserved!\nFluttershy: Now, now, he's learned his lesson. Isn't that right, my little patient?\nDiscord: I'm so glad that you're back from your trip, Fluttershy. Just your presence here is making me feel so much better. I was just wondering, could I trouble you for just one more thing?\nTwilight Sparkle: No!\nDiscord: What? I was simply going to ask for a teeny, tiny glass of water.\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[cheering]\nCheese Sandwich: Well, Boneless.

I'm... not.\n\n[Pinkie Pie]\nFor all my life, all I've wanted to do\nWas make my friends want to smile true\nBut maybe I was wrong\nAnd Pinkie Pie shouldn't plan parties at all\n\nFor all my life, all I've wanted to do\nWas make my friends want to smile true\nBut maybe I was wrong\nAnd Pinkie Pie shouldn't plan parties at all\n\nI'll try to get up on my hooves\nAnd try a different task\nI'll find something new to do\nThere's gotta be more to me than planning a party or two\n\nI'll try to get up on my hooves\nAnd try a different task\nI'll find something new to do\nThere's gotta be more to me than planning a party or two\n\nI put away my party cannon, I deflated all my balloons\nThe bubbles all burst, now what is next for you?\nFor you...\n\nI put away my party cannon, I deflated all my balloons\nThe bubbles all burst, now what is next for you?\nFor you...\n\nOh, I remember this one: my first party ever. My whole family was there. And that's Twilight's welcome-to-Ponyville party. She didn't even expect that one. [giggles] Oh, look at Gummy! He just looks so excited for this birthday party! Hmm. Shining Armor and Cadance's wedding sure was special, especially once I got a hold of the music.\n\nOh, look at those happy faces\nAll the parties that I had thrown\nI made them laugh, had such a blast\nA smile that's all their own\nThey loved seeing me, the real Pinkie\nShow them the time of their life like they've never known\nLike they've never kno-o-own\n\nOh, look at those happy faces\nAll the parties that I had thrown\nI made them laugh, had such a blast\nA smile that's all their own\nThey loved seeing me, the real Pinkie\nShow them the time of their life like they've never known\nLike they've never kno-o-own\n\nI've got to get back out there, have to show them that I've tried\nFor there's only one great party pony -- that is Pinkie Pie\nWon't let Cheese Sandwich beat me, won't let him get me down\nFor I am Pinkie, the bestest party pony around!\n\nI've got to get back out there, have to show them that I've tried\nFor there's only one great party pony -- that is Pinkie Pie\nWon't let Cheese Sandwich beat me, won't let him get me down\nFor I am Pinkie, the bestest party pony around!\n\nRarity: I must say I marvel at your superior party planning expertise, Cheese Sandwich.

And I know just what to do!\n\nRainbow Dash: Totally awesome!\nApplejack: Huh. Best I've ever seen.\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't believe it!\n[ponies awing]\nPinkie Pie: Freeze, Cheese! I challenge you... to a goof off!\n[ponies gasp]\nFluttershy: Oh, no! Not a goof off!\nApplejack: [whispering] What's a goof off?\nFluttershy: I have no idea, hehe.\nCheese Sandwich: This Cheese has stood alone a long time, Pinkie Pie. You think you can out-goof me?\nPinkie Pie: Oh, I don't think so. I know so! And the stakes are high, Cheese Sandwich. Whoever wins will be dubbed the ultimate super duper party pony and headline the Rainbow Dash birth-iversary bash!\nTwilight Sparkle: And the loser?\nPinkie Pie: Doesn't!\nRainbow Dash: [gasps]\nRest of main cast: [gasps]\nPinkie Pie: So, are you in, Cheese? Or are you... boneless?\nCheese Sandwich: Nopony calls me boneless. Right, Boneless?\nPinkie Pie: Then the goof off is on for high noon!\nTwilight Sparkle: Um, Pinkie?

Make it 3:10 to goof off!\n\n[eagle screeches]\n[clock ticks]\n[spurs jangling]\n[squeaking]\nPinkie Pie: [blows party horn]\nTwilight Sparkle: All right, everypony. According to my official goof off rulebook...\nRainbow Dash: She actually has a goof off rulebook?\nSpike: Are you kidding? Twilight can find a rulebook for everything!\nMatilda: Shhh.\nTwilight Sparkle: The two competitors have free range to goof about -- be it by singing, dancing, playing, prancing, joking, or performing -- to make the judge chortle, chuckle, giggle, guffaw, hoot and holler, whoop it up, and party down.\n[tuba sounds]\nTwilight Sparkle: The funnier, sillier, wilder, and goofier, the better. Rainbow Dash, since the winner will be headlining your party, you are the judge.\nRainbow Dash: Heh. Big tense competition on my birth-iversary. What could be better?\nTwilight Sparkle: Cheese Sandwich, Pinkie Pie, are you ready?\nPinkie Pie: I was born ready!\nCheese Sandwich: I was ready before I was born!\nTwilight Sparkle: Then...

Cheese Sandwich really is a super duper party planner, and he'll be a terrific headliner. I should've been a big enough pony to admit that and let you have your day.\nRainbow Dash: But don't you get it? You're both super duper party ponies. Sure, Cheese Sandwich is a great guest party pony, but you're Ponyville's permanent party pony. Nopony could ever take your place, and we could never have a party without you.\nCheese Sandwich: Rainbow Dash is right. I never meant to take your place in Ponyville. I just wanted to show you what a great party pony I am, Pinkie.\nPinkie Pie: Why me?\nCheese Sandwich: Well...\n\n[Cheese Sandwich]\nI fear I told a little fib about my pony past\nI hope that when you hear the truth, you will not be aghast\nI wasn't quite the super party pony like I claimed\nThe fact is that I was so shy, nopony knew my name\n\nI fear I told a little fib about my pony past\nI hope that when you hear the truth, you will not be aghast\nI wasn't quite the super party pony like I claimed\nThe fact is that I was so shy, nopony knew my name\n\nI stumbled into Ponyville one afternoon by chance\nAnd found the biggest ever celebration party dance\nEverything was perfect, cheer was filling up the place\nAnd I saw that everypony had a smile upon their face\n\nI stumbled into Ponyville one afternoon by chance\nAnd found the biggest ever celebration party dance\nEverything was perfect, cheer was filling up the place\nAnd I saw that everypony had a smile upon their face\n\nI vowed that day to change my life, the past I did set free\nFor now Cheese Sandwich was a party pony full of glee\nA super duper party pony -- that's what I became\nI traveled all Equestria, and all did know my name\n\nI vowed that day to change my life, the past I did set free\nFor now Cheese Sandwich was a party pony full of glee\nA super duper party pony -- that's what I became\nI traveled all Equestria, and all did know my name\n\nBut that never would have happened on my own, I'll tell you why\nFor the one who threw that party, it was you, Pinkie Pie\n\nBut that never would have happened on my own, I'll tell you why\nFor the one who threw that party, it was you, Pinkie Pie\n\nPinkie Pie: Me?\nCheese Sandwich: Yes!\nPinkie Pie: Hah, really?!\nCheese Sandwich: Really!\nPinkie Pie: So I was the pony that threw the awesomely spectacular party that inspired you to become an awesome spectacular party thrower?\nCheese Sandwich: Swear on Camembert!\n[music warps down]\nRainbow Dash: Enough with the warm fuzzy stuff, you two.

I can't believe how many ponies showed up!\nPinkie Pie: I can! I mean, finding out who the Ponyville Days pony of ceremonies is is a pretty big deal!\nTwilight Sparkle: I didn't know Granny Smith was on the selection committee.\nApplejack: Of course she is. Ponyville Days celebrates the founding of Ponyville, and she was right there.\nPinkie Pie: I'm glad the committee didn't automatically pick me so everypony gets a chance to see how great being me actually is! Even though the festival's basically a party and the pony of ceremonies gets to organize the whole thing! So it'd totally make sense if they did pick me.\nPonies: Shhh!\n[microphone feedback]\nMayor Mare: Citizens of Ponyville, this year's applicants were all exceptional, but there can only be one Ponyville Days pony of ceremonies.

You really have put a lot of effort into this.\nApplejack: I'll say.\nFluttershy: Oh, I think it's going to be magical.\nRarity: [gasps] Do you really think so?\nPinkie Pie: Are you kidding? I can't wait!\nRarity: Oh, that's such a relief. But of course, I couldn't possibly do it all on my own. The festival is in three days!\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie Pie and I can hang lights and decorations in the town square!\nApplejack: And I can get Sweet Apple Acres all ready for the cider tastin'.\nRarity: Oh, that's just perfect! And now, Twilight, if you and Fluttershy wouldn't mind helping with the fashion show...\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course!\nFluttershy: I'd be honored.\nRarity: I can focus on the thing I'm worried about most of all.\nMain cast sans Rarity: What?\nRarity: Creating a Ponyville Days festival fantastic enough to impress... Trenderhoof!\n[beat]\nApplejack: Uh, who's Trenderhoof?\nRarity: What?! How can you not know who Trenderhoof is? Trenderhoof is only the most amazing, handsomest travel writer to have ever traveled or written! Before Las Pegasus became an Equestria travel destination, he wrote about it! Before the culinary revolution in Trottingham, he discovered it! He knows what's going to be hot even before it's tepid! [giggles]\nTwilight Sparkle: Sounds like somepony has a little bit of a crush.\nRarity: Oh, Twilight, \"crush\" doesn't even begin to describe it. He's practically divine. I can't believe he's coming! [tittering]\n\n[train engine noises]\nRarity: Thank you ever so much for joining me, Twilight. I don't think I could have met Trenderhoof on my own!\nTwilight Sparkle: It's no problem, but you shouldn't be nervous about meeting him.\n[ponies chattering]\nRarity: Is that him? Is he here? Twilight, is he there?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uhh... I'm not sure.\nRarity: You don't suppose he's decided not to come? Twilight, I don't see him! What if he doesn't arrive? The whole festival will be a disaster! Twilight, where is he?!\n[beat]\nRarity: [clears throat] Sorry.\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity, you have to get a hold of yourself. I mean, you haven't even met him yet!\n[bubbles popping]\nRarity: [gasps]\nTwilight Sparkle: What's wrong?\nRarity: Shh! [hushed, quickly] It's him, it's him, is it him? Is it him? It's him, he's here, he's here!\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, go up and talk to him!\nRarity: [unintelligible screeching] I can't! [nervous laughing] Uh, hi\u2013 [clears throat] Hello, Mr. Trenderhoof. I am Rarity, and I have been chosen as pony of ceremonies for the Ponyville Days festival. [nervous laughing]\nTrenderhoof: Please, call me 'Trend'.\n[thud]\n\nRarity: And over here will be the climax of the festival, the Ponyville Days gala! Music, dancing! [laughs nervously] And of course a locally sourced menu of delicious treats.\nTrenderhoof: Reminds me of the \"Spring Fling meets Manehattan Wedding\" I wrote about in Gallop & Prance.\nRarity: Exactly! I, I can't even describe how much your work has influenced me!\n\nRarity: And finally, Sweet Apple Acres. Ponyville's core, heh-heh, so to speak, where our quaint little hamlet began.\nTrenderhoof: Oh, breathtaking! I've heard about it of course, but to see it in v\u00e9rit\u00e9, to stand on the soil of a working farm... you can really feel the authenticity.\nRarity: Oh, yes, uh, they, they really do grow apples here.\nTrenderhoof: Thank you, Rarity. Thank you for bringing me here. This farm is truly something special.\nRarity: Oh, I had planned to transform it into an elegant country inn for the festival... but now I see just how special it is au naturel.\nTrenderhoof: Au naturel indeed.\n[bubbles popping]\nTrenderhoof: Who... is... that?\nApplejack: [panting]\nRarity: Who? Applejack? Ahem! Why are you staring at her like that?\nTrenderhoof: I've seen a lot in my travels, but I've never beheld such beauty. Applejack... the pony of my dreams...\n\nSpike: Rarity? Rarity! Hello?\nRarity: [muffled sobbing]\nSpike: I brought my cider-tasting cup. Are you ready to go try the samples?\nRarity: [sobbing throughout] What's the point?!\nSpike: Rarity, what's wrong?\nRarity: [quietly] Nothing.\nSpike: Is it something I said?\nRarity: [quietly] He doesn't like me.\nSpike: What?\nRarity: [quietly] He doesn't like me.\nSpike: Rarity, I can't hear what you're\u2014\nRarity: He doesn't like me because he has a crush on Applejack, even though I've had a crush on him ever since the beginning of time, and it's not fair!\nSpike: Trenderhoof doesn't like you? That's ridiculous!\nRarity: Oh, Spike, how could you ever know what it's like to be totally obsessed with a pony only to find out they're obsessed with somepony else?\n[beat]\nRarity: I mean, what could Applejack possibly have that I don't?!\nSpike: I 'unno.\nRarity: Hmm...\n\nTrenderhoof: You know, I have such respect for the work ethic of Earth ponies.\nApplejack: Uh, gee, thanks. Granny Smith always said, \"Pick an apple a day and keep trouble away.\"\nTrenderhoof: How many varieties of apples do you think there are?\nApplejack: Uh, on the farm or in all of Equestria? 'Cause\u2014\nTrenderhoof: I once had an apple so rare, they thought it was extinct. I ate four of them. [bites]\n[splash]\nApplejack: Is that a fact?\nTrenderhoof: That's my thing. I take the mundane, the simple, the unappreciated, and I make it relatable.\nApplejack: Well, I hope you can relate to Ponyville.\nTrenderhoof: Me too. But enough about me. I wanna know about you! What do apples mean to Applejack?\nApplejack: Look, I'm glad you're interested in Ponyville 'n' all, but I'm kinda busy with my chores. And if I can't get 'em done, there won't be a Ponyville Days festival for you to write about.\nRarity: Well, that will never do!\nApplejack: Rarity, what are you wearin'?\nRarity: What, this old thing?\nApplejack: Aren't you too busy plannin' the festival to keep makin' new outfits for it?\nRarity: I am. But the thought of hauling apples inspired me, and I just couldn't stop myself!\nApplejack: Really?\nRarity: If there's one thing I love, it's hauling apples!\nTrenderhoof: [dreamily] I'm growing fond of it myself.\nApplejack: [under her breath] Maybe you two should try it sometime.\nTrenderhoof: I'm feeling a tad inspired.\nWithout farm life, there'd be such disparity\nThese thoughts I think with great clarity\nApples high to the sky\nShe's the one of my eye\nThat fruit-hauling pony named... Applejack!\nRarity: [mule bray]\n[bubble shattering]\n\nWithout farm life, there'd be such disparity\nThese thoughts I think with great clarity\nApples high to the sky\nShe's the one of my eye\nThat fruit-hauling pony named... Applejack!\n\nSpike: Rarity, why do you want to plow a field?\nRarity: Is it me, or could this use a splash of color? And maybe a wash!\nSpike: Don't we need to check on the gala decorations?\nRarity: Yes, yes, of course, but Trend obviously has a thing for farm life. If I can't convince him that I'm just as much of a farm hoof as Applejack, I'll never get him interested in the festival.\nSpike: The festival. Right.\nRarity: And I do appreciate your help ever so much. I couldn't do a thing without you, Spikey-poo.\nSpike: Well, that's what friends are for!\nRarity: Right, so. [whips reins] Come on! [grunts] Farm... thing! [sighs] Oh, how does Applejack do it?\nApplejack: Well, it would help if the harness was on right. What are you doin'?\nRarity: I am simply lending a hoof with the chores, which I love doing ever so much.\nApplejack: Well if you're still interested after the festival I can teach you all about it. But right now, I need to get the plowin' done, if you don't mind.\nRarity: Not at all. Ugh! Oh!\nSpike: She makes it look so easy.\nTrenderhoof: [dreamily] I know. Isn't she fantastic?\n\nApplejack: [grunts]\nTrenderhoof: [clapping]\nRarity: I really don't see what the fuss is all about.\n[tapping]\nApplejack: Now, Rarity, you be careful. If you don't get the buckin' just right, you could sprain a hoof.\nRarity: I am perfectly familiar with the apple-bucking process, thank you very much. But while you seem to rely on raw power, I believe a certain amount of style is required. It's really more of a dance, if you ask me. [happy 'hm'ing noises] Et voil\u00e0!\nApplejack: Well, your way is definitely long on style.\nRarity: Thank you.\nApplejack: Now, if you'll all excuse me, I have some more chores to do. Inside!\n[chickens clucking]\nTrenderhoof: Rarity, can I ask you something?\nRarity: Oh, why, Trend, you can ask me anything.\nTrenderhoof: I've been meaning to ask for a while, and frankly I'm sort of embarrassed. Rarity... do you think... Applejack would be my date for the festival?\nRarity: Why don't you go ask her yourself?! Hmph!\n\n[chickens clucking]\n[door slamming]\nApplejack: Whew! Well, that was close.\nRarity: If you've come to apologize, there's really no need.\nApplejack: What are you talkin' about?\nRarity: Let's dispense with the charade, shall we?\nApplejack: Listen, I know you really want Trend to like you\u2014\nRarity: And he does! Despite somepony's best efforts!\nApplejack: I swear I don't know why he's payin' so much attention to me. And I don't know anypony who's that interested in farmin'. Not even me!\nRarity: Well, maybe it's time Trend met a real country pony.\nApplejack: Shouldn't you be workin' on the festival instead of comin' up with new ways to impress Trend?\nRarity: Oh, I'm sure you'd love that. Well, I have a new vision for the festival, [in country accent] and it's gonna be more country than the whole Apple family put together!\n\nFluttershy: Um, isn't it a little late to be changing the theme?\n[door closes]\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack, what's going on?\nApplejack: I'm too scared to guess.\n[lights buzz]\nRarity: [country accent] Firstly, I just want to thank you all for comin', and second, I know y'all will all adore my new festival theme!\nSpike: [playing banjo]\nRarity: [country accent] \"Simple Ways\"!\n\nApplejack: [laughing]\nRarity: [country accent throughout] Well? What's so funny?\nApplejack: Rarity, that is the silliest getup I have ever seen!\nFluttershy: It is a little funny.\nRarity: Fun-nay?\nTwilight Sparkle: [laughing] Rarity, you aren't serious, are you?\nRarity: [normal voice] Well of course I'm serious\u2013 [clears throat] [back in country accent] Why wouldn't I be?\nApplejack: Because you would never dress like that. You like fashion and high society and fancy things.\nRarity: And I can like plowin' fields and haulin' apples just as much.\nApplejack: But you don't!\nRarity: How do you know what I like?\nApplejack: Because I know you.\nRarity: Wail, maybe you don't know me as well as you thank.\nApplejack: And I suppose it's just a coincidence that Trenderhoof seemed so interested in country life, too?\nRarity: I don't know what you're gittin' at!\nApplejack: Well then, I guess I'll just have to show you!\nRarity: Be my guest! Now, if you all will excuse me, I have a hootenanny of a festival to put on.\nApplejack: [growls]\n\nRarity: [country accent throughout] Now, to be a model in the Simple Ways fashion show, you might think \"simple\" means \"less is more\". Well, that just ain't so. If you want to be real simple, more is more. Now, y'all go off and make yourselves look just like that. [to Spike] Who's our next model for the fashion show?\nSpike: Um... Apple... Jewel?\nRarity: Who the hay is that?\n[tango music]\nRarity: Is this some kind of joke?\nApplejack: [upper-class accent throughout] Why, Rarity, whatever would make you think I was joking?\nRarity: [normal voice] Because you would never wear an ensemble like that. You like plowing fields and hauling apples\u2014\nApplejack: And I can like fashion just as much.\nRarity: [back in country accent] But you don't!\nApplejack: Well, maybe you do not know me as well as you think.\nRarity: Fine. But I got a whole festival to plan, so if you're goin' to start modelin', just get on with it!\nApplejack: Life is a festival, and you should celebrate it by looking just like me! Because I'm a trend-setting fashionista!\n[camera snapping]\nRarity: [normal voice] You're a trend-setting fashionista?! Why, that is the most ridiculous thing I've ever\u2013 I mean...

[mule bray]\nApplejack: Oh, is that so?\nRarity: Yes, indeedy-doodle!\nApplejack: [gasp] Not me! My mane needs to be perfectly coiffed at all times.\nRarity: Well, my mane is full of dust and split ends.\nApplejack: My hooves are so polished, you can see your reflection in them.\nRarity: My hooves are cracked and dry from working in the fields!\nApplejack: I'm so fashion-forward.\nRarity: I wear droopy drawers!\nApplejack: I smell like rosebuds.\nRarity: I love being covered in mud!\n[splash]\n[splat]\nRarity: [normal voice] Goodness! Your couture! Ooh, it's bad. Will somepony bring me a towel to wipe this repulsive filth from my hooves?!\nApplejack: [normal voice] There's the Rarity I know!\nRarity: Oh, Applejack, I'm sorry I said all those things. You're a true friend who probably knows me better than I know myself. I don't know what I was thinking wearing this ridiculous outfit.\nApplejack: I kinda know how you feel.\nRarity: Oh, but you were just trying to help me see how silly I was being. And you were right. [sighs] Besides, that gown looks just gorgeous on you. I wish I hadn't ruined it.\nApplejack: Thanks! It's nice, ain't it?\nRarity: It's magnificent! Wherever did you get it?\nApplejack: Oh, it's, uh, one of yours.\nRarity: I'll need three gallons of boiling water and one ounce of detergent, stat!\nTrenderhoof: [clears throat] I'm moving to Ponyville! Being the most interesting pony in Equestria is exhausting.

If somepony doesn't like you for who you are, it's their loss.\nTrenderhoof: Well, this is awkward.\nRarity: Not at all. In fact, I think I know just how you feel.\nApplejack: What do you think, Rarity? Is it too late to go back to \"Small Town Chic\"?\nRarity: Not if I can help it!\n\n[ponies talking in background]\nRarity: Organizing the Ponyville Day celebration was one of the hardest things I've ever done. But I learned an important lesson. Real friends will like you for who you are, and changing yourself to impress them is no way to make new ones.

Where are we ever going to find a deep voice to replace Big Mac's?\nZecora: [chuckles]\nRarity: Pardon me, Zecora, but this is no laughing matter! We need a bass voice for the harmonies to work! Without it, the performance will be ruined!\nZecora: Please, forgive my strange elation, but I was not laughing at your situation.\nRarity: Then what?\nZecora: Remember when you pony folk stumbled into poison joke?

I'll do it! I'd do anything for the animals!\nRarity: Why, you'd even appear on stage!\nFluttershy: Oh. Except that.

I don't know how I do it.\nApple Bloom: I can't believe she gets so much attention without even really doing anything!\nScootaloo: She's using somepony else to build herself up, and without even putting any effort to learn her own skills like we do!\nSweetie Belle: Hey, come to think of it, if we get really good at the stuff Twilight's teaching us, we could be the big shots around here for a change! Hmm...\n\nScootaloo: Check this out!\nApple Bloom: And check this out!\nFoals: [awed comments]\nSweetie Belle: Now check this out!\nDiamond Tiara: [yelping] Hey, put me down!\nFoals: [laughing]\n\nSweetie Belle: [giggling]\nDiamond Tiara: Hey, can you hear me?\nSweetie Belle: Huh? Huh? What? What?\nDiamond Tiara: I was asking if your sister Rarity will be taking you to Manehattan anytime soon.\nSilver Spoon: Because if she is, maybe you can meet up with us while we hang out with a bunch of famous celebrities.\nScootaloo: Cool!\nApple Bloom: Wow, that's... pretty nice of you guys.\nSweetie Belle: Actually, my sister hasn't offered to take me to Manehattan anytime soon.\nDiamond Tiara: Yeah, we figured.\nDiamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: Bump, bump, sugar lump rump! [laughing]\nSweetie Belle: Oh, yeah?! Well, I don't have to go all the way to Manehattan to hang out with the famous and super-cool ponies! Me and my friends hang out with Princess Twilight all the time!\nDiamond Tiara: D-did you say Princess Twilight?! You hang out with her all the time? For real?\nApple Bloom: More like just once a week.\nScootaloo: She helps us learn cool new stuff to do! That we actually do ourselves!\nDiamond Tiara: You must bring me along next time you go!\nSilver Spoon: Bring us along!\nDiamond Tiara: I mean, we used to see her around town all the time, and I thought, \"whatever\"...\nSilver Spoon: Me too. I thought that.\nDiamond Tiara: But now she's a princess, which makes her totally awesome!\nSilver Spoon: Plus, she has wings.\nDiamond Tiara: And she's an Alicorn. So can I\u2013\nSilver Spoon: We!\nDiamond Tiara: \u2013go?\nApple Bloom: I don't think we should\u2013\nSweetie Belle: Would you two excuse us for a moment? We should totally say yes! This is a golden opportunity!\nApple Bloom: Are you kiddin'? I don't want them laughing at us while I'm mixin' potions and accidentally sendin' plants into chokin' fits!\nSweetie Belle: But don't you get it? They'll have to learn something too!\nScootaloo: And they won't be able to laugh at us when they're so busy trying to learn stuff of their own.\nApple Bloom: I must admit it's kinda fun to see them workin' hard to get on our good side for a change.\n\nDiamond Tiara: Oh, my gosh! A princess lives in there! And I'm about to go inside and see her! I can't even tell you how excited I am!\nSilver Spoon: I can't either!\n[knocking]\nSweetie Belle: Now remember, Twilight takes this time out with us so we can learn stuff.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey there, guys! Come on in!\nDiamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: [squealing] Princess Twilight!\nDiamond Tiara: Oh, it's really her!\nSilver Spoon: Oh, my gosh, I don't believe it!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, and, uh, you brought guests. Great!\nDiamond Tiara: Princess Twilight, it is such a thrill and honor to be here! You have no idea. Oh my gosh, who dyes your tail?\nSilver Spoon: I so have to get that done.\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, it's not dyed. I've always\u2013\nDiamond Tiara: [gasp] Are those books in there? What a bold design choice!\nSilver Spoon: You should so do that, Di!\nDiamond Tiara: I know, right?\nTwilight Sparkle: Listen, I'm all for helping as many ponies as I can, but maybe we should keep these weekly visits just between us, hm? Okay, which one of you wants to practice first?\nSweetie Belle: Shouldn't they go first?\nTwilight Sparkle: No, silly! I set up Twilight Time especially for you. Apple Bloom, go ahead. Let's see how your plant potions are coming.\n\nApple Bloom: I can't believe I let you talk us into bringin' guests yesterday.\nScootaloo: I didn't hear them laugh at us once, Apple Bloom.\nApple Bloom: 'Cause they laughed on the inside.\nSweetie Belle: Don't worry. We won't make that same mistake again.\nApple Bloom: Aw, great. Look who showed up to make fun of us.\nScootaloo: So much for learning skills to be big shots.\nDiamond Tiara: Hey, guess what! I told everyone about your special Twilight Time!\nSweetie Belle: Oh, no, here it comes...\nDiamond Tiara: And they all want in!\nFoals: Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! [continuing under]\nDiamond Tiara: Thanks to me, you three are now the hottest thing around. You're welcome.\nSweetie Belle: Uh-oh...\n\nFoals: Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! [continuing under]\nSweetie Belle: Wow! All these ponies really wanna meet Twilight that badly?\nPipsqueak: We love you, Cutie Mark Crusaders!\nFoals: [cheering]\nDiamond Tiara: Now, now, everypony! Demanding time with the princess as an unruly mob simply won't do. Might I suggest you get organized through us, the Cutie Mark Crusaders' nearest and dearest friends?\nSilver Spoon: Everypony get in line! No pushing, no pushing!\nFoals: [cheering, under]\nApple Bloom: What a mess.\nSweetie Belle: Of awesome! Don't you see? We're really and truly and certifiably the biggest of the big shots in school right now!\nScootaloo: Huh?\nSweetie Belle: They all think we're the greatest, because we're their ticket to get time with Ponyville's newest and biggest celebrity, Princess Twilight!\nApple Bloom: We just said like two seconds ago that invitin' two ponies to Twilight Time was a big mistake! And now we're supposed to bring the whole class?\nSweetie Belle: Relax. I got this.\n\nApple Bloom: I don't like this, Sweetie Belle...\nSweetie Belle: You said not to invite them to Twilight Time and I didn't. So what's the problem?\nScootaloo: This feels like a trick.\nSweetie Belle: What's tricky about inviting Twilight out for a meal thanking her for all the nice things she's done for us? Seems like the least we can do for the princess!\nPipsqueak: Did someone say \"princess\"?\nSweetie Belle: When I told you when you could come eyeball the princess at one of her favorite hangouts, I said only two or three of you, tops!\nFoals: Oops...\nScootaloo: She's coming!\nSweetie Belle: Okay! But stay out of sight!\nDiamond Tiara: As you wish, Sweetie Belle.\nSweetie Belle: Yes, as I wish.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [messy eating noises] Mmm! Mmmm, mm! [with mouth full] I didn't realize how hungry I was! I'm so glad you asked me to join you here today... [swallows] I'm so honored! Mm!\nSweetie Belle: You are?\nTwilight Sparkle: When you first asked me to help you develop new skills, I thought, 'Working with young students so devoted to the joy of learning purely for its own sake? What could be better?' You all remind me of myself when I was your age!\nSweetie Belle: Yes, well... we feel the same way.\nApple Bloom: That's why we invited you here.\nScootaloo: All because of our love of learning!\nTwilight Sparkle: [sipping drink]\nPinkie Pie: Twilight! Haven't seen you here in, like, forever and a half!\nTwilight Sparkle: I know. I've been so busy I forgot how delicious everything is here!\nPinkie Pie: Totally! Hey, what's going on out there? Oh, never mind, they're gone. They're back! Never mind, they're gone. La la-la la-la...\n[cameras clicking]\nApple Bloom: [through gritted teeth] Knock it off!\nTwilight Sparkle: What in the world is going on out\u2013 [gasp]\nApple Bloom: What was all this? And this?\nScootaloo: I couldn't help it! When I don't smile in a picture, I look sad.\nSweetie Belle: Oh, we're gonna look sad all right...\n[doors close]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] [long pause] Uh, can I... help you?\nFoals: [excited screaming]\nDiamond Tiara: Get my picture with her!\nPipsqueak: Me first!\nSilver Spoon: Hey! Get out of the shot!\nSweetie Belle: This is bad.\nScootaloo: Twilight's gonna be so ticked at us.\nApple Bloom: I told ya this was a terrible idea.\nTwilight Sparkle: You seriously all want my autograph? Okay, I'll sign just a couple more for you, but then I really must get back to my little friends. Oh, there you are!\nPipsqueak: Wow, to think I've been to the Hay Burger so many times, never knowing it's a regular hangout for a princess!\nTwilight Sparkle: This isn't my regular hangout. I'm only here to be with them.\nPipsqueak: You mean, Princess Twilight decides where it's cool to go based on where they go?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks, guys, this was fun! See ya around!\nFoals: [excited chattering]\nPipsqueak: I'm opening a new lemonade stand! Won't you come to the grand opening? I'll give you free lemonade for a week!\nSweetie Belle: Relax. I know exactly how to handle this.\n\n[scissors cutting]\nFoals: [cheering]\n[glasses clinking]\nPipsqueak: More lemonade?\nSweetie Belle: Don't mind if I do!\nClassmate Pony 2: Done shining your hooves! It's an honor to do you the favor!\nScootaloo: Whoa, so bright I can see myself!\nApple Bloom: And so can I! Nice job bedazzlin' my bow! What do I owe you?\nClassmate Pony 3: Your gratitude is thanks enough.\nDiamond Tiara: You three must come to my pool party. It'll be much cooler than this.\nSweetie Belle: Look who's inviting who to her fancy house!\nApple Bloom: I believe we have arrived, Cutie Mark Crusaders.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Yeah!\n\n[splash]\nApple Bloom: [laughs]\nSweetie Belle: Wow, this is nice, but there's no one else here. Why is this party cooler, exactly?\nDiamond Tiara: Because of all the ponies we're keeping out.\nSweetie Belle: This has been great, but we have to go. It's Twilight Time.\nDiamond Tiara: So, we're coming too, right?\nSweetie Belle: Um... a-actually, no. We didn't have a chance to ask Twilight, so\u2013\nDiamond Tiara: Really? After all the favors we did for you? After all the favors they did for you?\nFoals: Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! [continuing under]\nSweetie Belle: Okay, I know exactly how to handle this. Run!\n\nFoals: Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! [continuing under]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [straining]\nSweetie Belle: Go, go, go!\nScootaloo: We gotta beat them to Twilight's so we can explain!\nSweetie Belle: This way! I know a shortcut!\nFoals: Twilight Time! [continuing under]\nApple Bloom: Then we run, like the wind!\nFoals: Twilight Time! Twilight Time!\n\nSweetie Belle: [gasps] [out of breath] We... made... it... Quick! Knock on\u2013\n[tires screeching]\n[knocking]\n[door opens]\nSweetie Belle: Twilight, we can explain.\nApple Bloom: We know you said we should just keep Twilight Time to us!\nScootaloo: We didn't mean for so many other ponies to be here! Honest!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, don't be silly. I only meant that for your benefit so you could get the most out of our time together. But if you want to share your time with others, that's fine.\nScootaloo: So you're not mad?\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course not! Come on in, everypony! Spike made nachos!\nFoals: [excited chattering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Turns out we'll need some more than that.\nSpike: [sighs]\n\nFoals: [excited chattering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Before we start, we should maybe get a bit more organized? Ponies interested in magic in this corner. Ponies who want to learn potions over here. Bookworm ponies over there.\nApple Bloom: Incredible. Looks like everything's workin' out just fine.\nScootaloo: And I was so afraid Twilight would be disappointed in us.\nSweetie Belle: Told you I knew exactly how to handle all this!\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks to all of you for taking time out to come learn new things.\nDiamond Tiara: Thank you, princess!\nSilver Spoon: We love you, princess!\nFoals: [You're awesome, etc.]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, okay, let's settle down. If you want to thank anypony, thank the Cutie Mark Crusaders for so generously sharing this time.\nSweetie Belle: It was nothing, really. We just felt it was the right thing to do.\nDiamond Tiara: Hmph! What a laugh.\nTwilight Sparkle: Let's begin over here. And what would you like to learn, little one?\nPipsqueak: I want to learn how to become a Cutie Mark Crusader!\nTwilight Sparkle: And why do you want to become a Cutie Mark Crusader so badly, hm?\nPipsqueak: Because then I could get all my classmates to do me favors and stuff because I'm friends with a famous princess!\nSweetie Belle: Oh, boy.\nTwilight Sparkle: Is this true?\nSweetie Belle: We wanted our time together just as a way to be with you and learn new things. Really and truly!\nTwilight Sparkle: Prove it.\nSweetie Belle: Huh?!\nTwilight Sparkle: If it's true, then I'm sure you've all been practicing your skills over the past week. Show me how much better you got.\nApple Bloom: Uh, well, uh... we... can't.\nScootaloo: We kinda rushed over and forgot to bring our stuff.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hm, I see.\nSweetie Belle: No, wait! Hey, everypony, you're in luck! You came to learn, but instead you're getting dinner and a show! Get ready, 'cause we, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, are about to lay on you the amazing skills we learned in Twilight Time!\nFoals: [intrigued chatter]\nSweetie Belle: Unfortunately, since we don't have Scootaloo's unicycle parts, she'll take apart and put back together one of the scooters from outside.\nPipsqueak: Hey! That's my scooter!\nScootaloo: You got us into this mess, kid. Might wanna roll with us.\nPipsqueak: Huh?\nSweetie Belle: Apple Bloom doesn't have her apple seed with her, so she'll just grab an apple from the kitchen. And I will begin by using my magic to lift this broom!\nScootaloo: Ta-da!\nApple Bloom: Become a tree!\nSweetie Belle: Rise!\n[creaking]\n[boom]\nSweetie Belle: That didn't turn out quite how I had hoped.\nTwilight Sparkle: Looks like Twilight Time is over.\nDiamond Tiara: And look who's not the princess's entourage anymore.\nFoals: Oooh!\nSilver Spoon: Guess they didn't come here to learn after all.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, neither did any of you.\nFoals: Awww...\nSweetie Belle: We're really sorry, Twilight. We made a huge mistake.\nApple Bloom: And we really and truly did enjoy learning new skills with you.\nScootaloo: Guess we'll have to just keep on doing it without you now. Thanks, Twilight.\n[poof]\nApple Bloom: Thanks...\nSweetie Belle: Thanks...\nTwilight Sparkle: Sweetie Belle? Remember a moment ago when you asked me to give you a chance?\nSpike: [straining] Aw, come on!\n\nSweetie Belle: I guess Twilight must not be so super-upset anymore, 'cause she's letting us do a diary entry like our sisters do. Boy, did we get our priorities messed up. We started acting special because we were friends with someone special. We almost forgot the real reason she's special \u2013 because she's our friend. But she forgave us, and, like magic, things are good as new! That's the kind of magic I really want to get good at, now that I'm getting so good at the other kind.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow, all three of you have made so much progress! I'm really proud of you. See you next time!\nSweetie Belle: We're just glad Twilight Time is back to normal. Well... almost back to normal. I just hope no one sees us.\nApple Bloom: 'Cause we're tryin' to keep Twilight Time a secret now?\nScootaloo: Or because we look ridiculous?\nSweetie Belle: A little of both, actually.\nTwilight Sparkle: [laughs]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nFluttershy: Okay, everypony. As you know, the adorable fairy creatures known as Breezies are about to come through Ponyville.\nPinkie Pie: Yes! Ooh, it's so exciting! Ah! I can't wait for Rainbow Dash to make the breeze for them so I can see how cute they are up close!\nRainbow Dash: I've never done it before, not that I won't be totally awesome at it, because I totally will!\nFluttershy: And that breeze is very important, but so is cheering on those teeny-tiny little things, so they have the confidence to ride that breeze to their native land. Did I mention how tiny they are? So tiny! I was thinking we could do a special Breezie cheer!\nPinkie Pie: I love cheers!\nFluttershy: But these cheers should be quiet cheers. We don't want to startle them. They need to be able to concentrate. Why don't we try it? You can do it, Breezies.\nRest of main cast: [shouting] You can do it, Breezies!\nFluttershy: Oh, my.\nApplejack: Heh, sorry, Fluttershy. I had no idea how hard it was to do a cheer quietly.\nFluttershy: Oh, it's okay. Quiet doesn't come naturally for everypony. Let's try it again.\nRest of main cast: [quieter but still loudly] You can do it, Breezies!\nFluttershy: Perhaps just a little bit quieter.\nRest of main cast: [quieter] You can do it, Breezies!\nFluttershy: Just a little quieter.\nRest of main cast: [practically whispering] You can do it, Breezies!\nFluttershy: [loudly] Perfect! Oh, um, I mean... yay.\n\n[theme song]\n\n[mariachi music playing]\n[wind blowing]\nRainbow Dash: That's too strong! We gotta slow this breeze down or we're gonna blow those Breezies apart!\nMr. Cake: What I don't understand is why they need the Pegasi to make a breeze for them.\nFluttershy: Well, you see, it's the breeze that activates the Breezies' magic, and that magic protects the pollen they're carrying from being destroyed.\nMr. Cake: So, no breeze means no magic means the pollen goes bad?\nFluttershy: That's right! And they only have two days to get that pollen back before the portal to their home closes. That's why it's ever-so-important that we help them make their way through Ponyville safely.\nMrs. Cake: We certainly wouldn't want to scare them and divert them from their path!\nFluttershy: Now you understand.\nMr. Cake: Hm, you certainly know a lot about them.\nFluttershy: Oh, thank you. I went to see them gathering their pollen in Western Equestria. Um, Rarity? I, uh, hate to weigh in with you when it comes to fashion, but...\nRarity: Oh, there's too much purple on this, isn't there? I knew it! But Twilight refused to admit it.\nTwilight Sparkle: What?! I-\nFluttershy: Oh, no-no-no-no-no. It's the perfect amount of purple. It's just that there's an awful lot of sequins on your jacket.\nRarity: Oh, darling, please! One can never have too many sequins! [chuckles]\nFluttershy: You can if they reflect the sun, and the light catches a group of Breezies right in their eyes, and blinds them long enough to get them off their course so they never get home!\nRarity: I stand corrected! I suppose there is the rare instance where one can have too many sequins. I'll just take off my jacket. I suppose this won't do either?\nTwilight Sparkle: [whispering] Everypony, it's time. Please welcome... the Breezies!\nApplejack: They're as cute as Apple Bloom on the day she was born.\nRarity: And would you look at those adorable little packs they carry their pollen in?\nSeabreeze: Lun! Arshen aifok!\nPinkie Pie: So... cute! Can't... take... it!\nSpike: [grunts] [hushed] Pinkie Pie, can I hop on you so I can see the Breezies?\nPinkie Pie: [hushed, straining] May explode!\n[thunk]\n[wind blows]\nSpike: Oh, no!\nBreezies: [panicking]\nCrowd: [gasps]\nRainbow Dash: Slow down the breeze for the other group to catch up!\nCloud Chaser: They're too far back! We can't connect the breeze to both sets of Breezies!\nRainbow Dash: What if we speed it up?\nFlitter: Then the first group'll be going too fast, and they'll get separated from each other!\nBreezies: [panicking]\n\nBreezies: [panicking]\nSeabreeze: Tanagretu nik mir! Maisegu de piripa!\nFluttershy: [gasps]\nSeabreeze: Mekenar stuf!\nFluttershy: He's right! You must all gather as close as you possibly can!\nCrowd: [cheering]\nSeabreeze: Mugudi saikendus?\nFluttershy: Oh, I understand the language of all kinds of creatures!\nSeabreeze: You must be so proud.\nFluttershy: And you speak my language too?\nSeabreeze: I can. This lot can only understand you. Clearly, they're not the brightest bunch around.\nBreezies: [shouts of indignation]\nPinkie Pie: That was amazing!\nRainbow Dash: I'm sorry we couldn't get a breeze going that would get them back to the others.\nFluttershy: Oh, it's not your fault.\nTwilight Sparkle: I, for one, am very proud of you, Fluttershy. Leaping into action like that.\nRarity: I feel like I should design you a special hero's gown! Heh... Or a sash. At least a sash.\nSpike: Okay, okay, okay! I know what you're all thinking! Why don't you just say it?! [crying] I'm sorry! This is all my fault! I'm so, so sorry!\nFluttershy: Oh, Spike, it's okay! It could have happened to any one of us.\nSpike: Okay... Thank you!\nBreezies: [shouting]\nSpike: Uh... I'm... just... gonna stay over here.\nRainbow Dash: So, Fluttershy, you want us to get the breeze going again so these little guys can get a move on?\nBreezies: [cries of protest]\nFluttershy: Maybe we should wait just a moment or so. They've been through so much...\nRainbow Dash: Just gimme the word when you think they're ready.\n\nAngel: [whimpers]\nFluttershy: Oh, my, Twirly, you look like you need a blanket.\nTwirly: Sanken\nFluttershy: Oh, no problem.\nBreezie: Malenki?\nFluttershy: Oh, did you need some more water?\nBreezie: [slurps]\nFluttershy: Now, who else needed a hoof-knitted sweater?\nBreezies: [cheering]\nApplejack: Hey there! Can we come in?\nFluttershy: Oh, of course! But watch your step!\nApplejack: Oop, sorry about that, little one.\nTwilight Sparkle: We just wanted to see if you thought the Breezies were ready to give it another try.\nFluttershy: Has it been an hour already? Oh, my goodness! Time flies when you're making sure little creatures don't feel that you're abandoning them to the cruel world.\nTwilight Sparkle: But they're not going to a cruel world, right? They're going home.\nFluttershy: Oh, yes, that's right!\nBreezies: [cries of protest]\nFluttershy: On second thought, I don't think they're quite ready.\nSeabreeze: Supa laipas data kurpa! Mise neku ersken laika maur! Siripat sulat!\nApplejack: Uh... what did he say?\nFluttershy: I'd... rather not say.\nApplejack: Okay, well, I'm sure you know what you're doin'. No one knows rare magical creatures like you do.\nTwilight Sparkle: We'll just wait for your word.\nFluttershy: Thank you. I'll be in touch very soon.\n[door closes]\nSeabreeze: We need to go now, or we will never get home! I wish we did not need that stupid breeze to activate our magic, or I would just force you all to fly home right now! Why do we have to need magic to keep our pollen safe?\nFluttershy: Um, now, Seabreeze-\nSeabreeze: Why are you giving in to these wimps?! If they had not been so scared in the first place, this never would have happened!\nFluttershy: But that is just not true, Seabreeze. It was because of a leaf, and you know that!\nSeabreeze: Oh, please! They have no idea what they're doing out there! Like you said, we need as much time as we can get because they are so incompetent!\nFluttershy: Well, I didn't say that exactly now, did I?\nSeabreeze: Hmph!\nFluttershy: Oh, well, maybe a snack will lighten the mood.\nBreezies: [coos of interest]\n\nBreezies: [chewing]\nBreezie: [burp] Mi fargen.\nFluttershy: You're excused. Well, my Breezies, I think we can all agree that now that you've eaten and you have a little energy going in your breezy bodies, you're strong enough to face the breeze! I've loved having you here, and I hope I've made you all feel loved and special. But you have to go. Nopony here will deny that-\nSeabreeze: There is nothing special about these losers! They cannot handle a simple breeze home! If they could just stick with the program and listen to me, we would be safe! At home! Home, where every Breezie is like us! [sighs]\nFluttershy: Okay, well, a confusing pep-talk, but nonetheless. I do know that if you don't leave soon, you may never make it back, and that would be terrible!\nBreezie: [sneezes] Merte marshken farde.\nTwirly: [coughs] Merki marshken plumatu.\nFluttershy: I had no idea you all have colds! Really? All of you?\nBreezies: [coughing]\nFluttershy: Oh, dear. I can't let you go out there sick! What kind of a friend would I be if I made you go now?\nBreezies: [excited chattering]\nSeabreeze: D'oh! Irde turten manes pudenhel! Nievo ut! Parde tarmen!\n\n[knocking]\nRainbow Dash: Hey, Fluttershy, just wondering if the Breezies are ready to go yet. Clock's kinda ticking for them to make it back before the door closes on their home.\nFluttershy: Oh, yes. I mean, not quite. Um, maybe just a few more minutes?\n[door closes]\nRainbow Dash: Uh, alright.\nFlitter: We wait too much longer, we'll have to create such a strong breeze, it may be more than they can handle.\nRainbow Dash: We just have to trust Fluttershy. She must know what she's doing.\n\nBreezies: [excited chattering]\n[saxophone playing]\n[crash]\nBreezies: Aww!\nSeabreeze: Why are you spending your time on this?! I will never get home!\nFluttershy: Breezies, I must say, Seabreeze has a point. I think it's time for me to get Rainbow Dash and her friends so they can create the breeze for you to get home.\nBreezies: [dismayed shouts]\nFluttershy: Ooh... You're all awfully anxious... Oh, I don't want you to feel abandoned, or that I wasn't the most kind host I could possibly be...\nTwirly: Adoshen papan gorn.\nFluttershy: Oh, yes, that does make sense... Seabreeze, do you think you could wait just a couple more hou- Seabreeze? Seabreeze? Has anypony seen Seabreeze? [gasps] Where's he going? There's no way he can handle being out there on his own!\n\n[wind blows]\nSeabreeze: Ah! Ah! Ah! Blusken! Ah! Ah! Arge nusen! Uf! Osemi! Ah! Narsken! Noi serenda! Ah!\n[series of thumps]\nSeabreeze: Ah! Gah! Ah! Kesino! Uu! Tu ge! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Miuse konda!\n[squeak]\n[bees buzzing]\nSeabreeze: Vaior uskren! Yavaya...\n[bees buzzing]\nSeabreeze: Ibeku-u-u! Ah, sa-sabada!\nFluttershy: Excuse me, bees? Can you please back off my Breezie friend? He didn't mean any harm. It was just an accident. I'm working on a bee-type dance and was hoping you could help me? Does this bring to mind any images for you? Perhaps a bee? Excuse me! I have done nothing but be kind, but I guess that is not working! You bees know better than to hurt a helpless Breezie! I demand that you go away now, or you'll have to answer to me!\nSeabreeze: Menkyulen. Thank you! Thank you so much! Thank you for coming after me!\nFluttershy: Of course. You could've gotten seriously hurt out there. Ponyville is much too dangerous for you. One tiny acorn is a threat!\nSeabreeze: Yeah, I know! That is one reason why I have been trying to get us to go from the beginning!\nFluttershy: Oh, my goodness. I was just trying not to hurt any creature's feelings, but my displays of kindness may have cost you everything... [gasps] Time is running out, and you may never make it home!\nSeabreeze: That is exactly what I have been telling all of them! But they do not listen to me! Nobreezie ever listens to me!\nFluttershy: Seabreeze, I understand your feelings are hurt, but it's hard for them to hear you when you're shouting and being mean. The message doesn't get across.\nSeabreeze: But what about those bees? You were not nice to them, and that was the only way they listened!\nFluttershy: Yes, but they had to go, and they wouldn't listen to me any other way. We need to go, now!\n\nFluttershy: My dear Breezies, I had to rescue Seabreeze from serious harm, and now I know more than ever that you must leave before it's too late! You would never survive in Ponyville.\nBreezies: Erski parli polin!\nFluttershy: I can't help you any more. In fact, I wasn't helping you at all by being nice. Oh... But the truth of the matter is that I must be firm! You must go, now!

I'm gonna try and see if I can slow it down. Now it's too light! Oh, this will never get them home!\nFluttershy: Oh, my. Maybe it's because there are too few of them. When they started their journey, there was more of them to face the breeze together.\nTwilight Sparkle: I've been studying an old spell book from the Castle of the Two Sisters. There's a spell that I think could help us! This is probably gonna feel a little funny at first, but you're gonna have to trust me.\nPinkie Pie: I love new ideas that make me feel funny at first!\nFluttershy: [gasps]\nRarity: [gasps]\nPinkie Pie: [giggles]\nMain cast: [excited noises]\nFluttershy: Maifo flai batendud!

It was not right that I called you names! I did not even really believe those things I said! I was worried we would never get back to our home, and I lashed out... I know you can do this! I believe in you! Hold on to me, let us join the group!\n\n[wind blowing]\nMain cast: [gasps]\nRainbow Dash: [high-pitched] Holy mini-sized paradise!\nRarity: [high-pitched] This is simply beautiful!

I must go now.\nSeabreeze: To remember us by.\nFluttershy: [high-pitched] Thank you! I'll miss you. I'll miss all of you! [voiceover, normal] My experiences with the Breezies have helped me to see that kindness can take many forms, and sometimes being too kind can actually keep a friend from doing what they need to do. Pushing them away may seem cruel, but it's sometimes the kindest thing you can do.\nRainbow Dash: [high-pitched] Whoa! That was a close one!\nApplejack and Rarity: [agreeing]\nTwilight Sparkle: [high-pitched] Okay, gather round.\n[magic zaps]\nRainbow Dash: So, uh, I've always kinda wondered what it would be like to be a griffon.\nTwilight Sparkle: Not a chance.\nRainbow Dash: You sure?

Even though it could change everything for you, forever and ever!\n[door opens]\nGranny Smith: So, we here have decided... that you're old enough to stay home alone and take care of the chores yourself for the afternoon!\nApple Bloom, Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle: [gasps]\nApple Bloom: I accept your decision.\nApple Bloom, Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle: [cheering]\n\n[theme song]\n\nApple Bloom: Stayin' home alone, by myself, on my own! I can't believe I'm really doin' it!\nApplejack: Now, hey there, filly. I know you're excited, but bein' the only pony here to take care of the day's chores is a big responsibility.\nApple Bloom: I know it! And it means everythin' to me that y'all think I'm grown up enough to handle it. I won't let you down.\nGranny Smith: Well, if'n I'm gonna make my train, I best to be off. When Great Aunt Pine Apple says a pony's gots to ride by a certain time, you better be there! You be sure and take care now, Apple Bloom. Y'all take care as well. I don't know which of your delivery routes is tougher. you're each headed to a mighty hard-to-reach town.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nApplejack: We know, Granny. That's the only reason I agreed to let Apple Bloom stay behind alone.\nApple Bloom: It is?\nApplejack: Oh, I didn't mean it like that, sugarcube. It's just, I take my job as your big sister real serious, which is why I spent all night makin' this.\nApple Bloom: What is it?\nApplejack: Just a little list of helpful reminders.\nApple Bloom: [reading] \"There's some soup for you in the 'frigerator. Be sure not to heat it up too much. If it's hot, blow on it to cool it off. And take little sips\u2014if you gulp, you could get hiccups.\" You don't have to worry about me. I can take care of myself and the chores! I'm ready for this.\nApplejack: [sighs] I guess you are. I'm just not so sure I am.\nApple Bloom: But you trust me and believe I'm grown up enough to handle this, right?\nApplejack: [sighs] Right. Okay then. Good luck, little sis\u2014 whoa!\nApple Bloom: [quickly] Okaygreatseeyousoonbye!\nApplejack, Apple Bloom and Granny Smith: [various goodbyes]\nBig McIntosh: Eyuu-up!\nApple Bloom: Woo-hoo! I'm alone! At home! I'm home alone! This is gonna be so awesome!\n\nApplejack: [teeth chattering] [grunts]\n[thud]\nApplejack: Eheheh... Sorry, Big Mac. I was just frettin' a bit about Apple Bloom. You think she's gonna be okay on her own?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nApplejack: I just keep on thinkin' of things I forgot to put on her list. Like, I didn't write down that if she wants to get a spoon out of the drawer, she needs to open the drawer first. [sighs] I know, I'm probably just bein' silly.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nApplejack: But I know I'd feel a heap better if I could just check on Apple Bloom one last time. You go on ahead and make your delivery. I'm just gonna take a quick peek, and then I'll make mine.\n\nApple Bloom: Okay, number one seventy two: \"Make sure to pump the bellows to keep the stove warm.\"\n[bellows pumping]\nApple Bloom: Check! \"Make sure the hats and bows closet is fully stocked.\" Check! [spits] That's everything on Applejack's list! And now that my chores are done, since there's no one else here, I get to make all the decisions! If I wanna listen to music, I can! If I wanna read a book, I can! If I wanna just stand here in the kitchen talkin' to myself, I can!\nApplejack: Apple Bloom!\nApple Bloom: Whoa!\n[crash]\nApple Bloom: Ugh... Applejack?\nApplejack: I came back to check on you, and I'm so glad I did! I never thought about how dangerous things are around here!\nApple Bloom: Thanks, but I'm really gonna be okay.\nApplejack: You are now! Because I'm here and I'm stayin'! No way am I leavin' my little baby sister home alone all by herself!\nApple Bloom: I'm not a baby! I can take care of myself! And what about those pies you're supposed to deliver?\nApplejack: Pies? Ha! Family's way more important than pies!\nApple Bloom: But I'm fine! And actually... this was kind of your fault.\nApplejack: I know. I should never have left you alone.\nApple Bloom: But I don't need you lookin' after me. I'm perfectly capable of stayin' home alone. Really! Just look! \"There's some soup for you in the 'frigerator.\"\nApplejack: What was that?\nApple Bloom: Watch me!\n[jars clinking]\n[splat]\nApple Bloom: Whoa! Ugh!\nApplejack: Oh, no! This is worse than I thought! Well, don't worry, Apple Bloom, I'm here now and I'm not leavin' you home alone ever again. I'm stickin' right by your side, always!\n\nApplejack: Apple Bloom? Apple Bloom!\nApple Bloom: Applejack's just overreactin' a bit. I'm sure she'll snap out of it. Whoa!\nApplejack: You need somethin'? I'm right here!\nApple Bloom: I know you mean well, but I don't need you watchin' over me! I can take care of things myself!\nApplejack: [laughs]\nApple Bloom: Look! Huh? Hey! Who put pillows on this rake?\nApplejack: [chuckles] Oh, I don't know. Maybe someone who really loves her little sister and doesn't want her to get an owie?\nApple Bloom: [growls]\n\nApple Bloom: Hey, Applejack! Watch me buck these apples on my own without anythin' bad happenin' to me! [grunts]\n[thunk]\n[leaves rustling]\nApple Bloom: Huh? [growls]\n\nApple Bloom: Hm? Hm.\n\n[door opens]\nApple Bloom: Oh, for the love of...! [sighs] You've gone and baby-proofed everythin'!\nApplejack: Heh, yup! Your big sister let you down once, but I promise it won't ever happen again.\nApple Bloom: But really, I'm fine! I can take care of myself. I don't need you watchin' over me!\nApplejack: Aw, that's sweet. I appreciate you tryin' to make me feel better, but don't worry. I'll always be here for you. Always!\nApple Bloom: [growls]\n\nApple Bloom: [sighs] And that's the reason I asked y'all to come over quick.\nApplejack: Hey, Apple Bloom! You need anything? A snack? A hoof massage? Maybe a snack while havin' a hoof massage?\nSweetie Belle: Why, that sounds delightful!\nApple Bloom: [through gritted teeth] No thank you!\nApplejack: O-kay, well you can count on me bein' close by if'n you need anythin'!\nApple Bloom: [sighs] You see what I mean? If this keeps up, I'm never gonna be able to do anythin' without Applejack hoverin' over me!\nScootaloo and Sweetie Belle: Mm-hm.\nScootaloo: So what can we do? Hmm.\nSweetie Belle: Uh...\nScootaloo: Um...\nApple Bloom: Hang on a sec! I got it!\nSweetie Belle: What?\nApple Bloom: The pies! I'll sneak out and deliver them! Granny said that they were goin' to some incredibly hard-to-reach town. If I can do it alone, that'll show Applejack I don't need somepony watchin' over me!\nScootaloo: Just one problem. Your sister's gonna come back and check on you any minute!\nSweetie Belle: Which means you need an escape plan.\nScootaloo: Ooh, and I got an idea for one! [mocks snoring] See? It'll look just like you're sleeping in bed. Sweetie and I can take turns! That way, when one of us gets tired, the other can take over. Brilliant, huh?\nSweetie Belle: Mm-hm!\nApple Bloom: You know what? It is! I got a feelin' this just might work!\nWe're gonna make my sister see\nI don't need her watchin' over me\u2014\nScootaloo: Stop! No time for a song! Applejack's coming!\nSweetie Belle: If you're gonna go, we've gotta get you out of here now!\nApple Bloom: Cutie Mark Crusaders, let's do it!\n[window opens]\nApple Bloom: Whoa!\n[wheels clattering]\nApplejack: [muffled] Everythin' okay in there, sugarcube?\nScootaloo: Quick, get in while I hide! Sweetie, no! You gotta sleep like Apple Bloom!\nSweetie Belle: How does she sleep?\nScootaloo: Like she does everything! With sass!\nApplejack: Huh. I guess you must've been so tuckered out, you sent your friends home and went to bed. Then again, you are a delicate flower. [sighs] Sleep tight, Apple Bloom. I'll check on you again in a bit.\n[door closes]\nScootaloo and Sweetie Belle: [sighs]\n[door opens]\nApplejack: Just checkin' in on you again!\n[door closes]\n[door opens]\nApplejack: Need anythin' now?\n[door opens]\nApplejack: How 'bout now?\n[door opens]\nApplejack: Need another blanket?\n[door opens]\nApplejack: Did I hear a cough?\n[door opens]\nApplejack: Want a glass of water?\n[clock ticking]\nSweetie Belle: [snoring]\n[door opens]\nApplejack: [yawning] Just... checkin' in on you again. [sighs] Look at you, dozin' so peaceful-like. Here I am, checkin' up on you every five seconds, and you're totally fine. Maybe you don't need me frettin' over you all the time.\nScootaloo: [gasps] [muffled] Wow, Apple Bloom will be so glad to hear that!\nApplejack: Huh? Scootaloo?\nScootaloo: Uh, um, n-no.\nApplejack: Sweetie Belle? But... where's Apple Bloom? She's not here! She could be anywhere! She could be lost, cold, hungry, itchy, stuffed up, needin' to go to the bathroom!\nSweetie Belle: Don't worry, we know exactly where she is.\nScootaloo: Yeah, she's making your pie delivery.\nApplejack: What?! No! Didn't she hear how difficult and dangerous it was?! [gasp] I may never see my little sister again!\n\nWe're gonna make my sister see\nI don't need her watchin' over me\u2014\n\nApplejack: Okay, Rarity's on her way here to look after you two. Now tell me, did Apple Bloom at least bring flameproof boots? A lion tamer's chair? A snake charmin' flute?! A hunk of ricotta?! [gasps] [teeth chattering] Okay, maybe there's still time to catch her before she gets there. When did she leave?\nSweetie Belle: It must've been hours ago.\nApplejack: Oh, no!\n\nApple Bloom: [sigh] I can't see a darn thing in this swamp. [yelps]\n[flames whooshing]\nApple Bloom: Well, now at least I can see.\n[chimera growls]\nChimera's tiger head: I'd stay where you are.

Ah, can you guysss ssspeak up?\nChimera's tiger head: I was about to tell our guest how we haven't eaten in days.\nChimera's goat head: My sisters and I can never agree on what to eat.\nChimera's snake head: [hisses] Excccept... pie.\nApple Bloom: Well, unfortunately, I gotta get these pies to a town on the other side of the swamp, so, uh...\nChimera's tiger head: Oh, you don't have to worry about that.\nChimera's goat head: Yeah, you don't have to worry about anything anymore.\nChimera's snake head: Because we're going to have our apple pie with a ssside of filly filet.\nApple Bloom: You don't say. [laughs nervously]\nChimera: [growling, bleating, and hissing]\nChimera's tiger head: Now, sisters, on three!

[panting] [straining noises]\nChimera: [growls, bleats, and hisses]\nChimera's tiger head: Where are the pies?!\nChimera's snake head: They're not back here.\nChimera's goat head: This is your fault! You think you've always got to be in charge!\nChimera's tiger head: [sighs] You're lucky, you know? You've got no idea what it's like to have a sister constantly looking over your shoulder!\nApple Bloom: Uh, actually...\nChimera's goat head: Let's try listening to me for a change! And I say, if there are no pies, let's settle for the filly filet!\nChimera's snake head: [hisses] Any lassst wordsss?\nApple Bloom: I really wish my sister were here!\nApplejack: Hang on, Apple Bloom! I'm a-comin'!\nChimera's tiger head and goat head: Get her!\nChimera's goat head: Hey! I thought I was in charge now!\nChimera's tiger head: [growls]\nApplejack: [plays snake charming flute]\nChimera's snake head: [hisses]\nChimera's tiger head: [growls] [roars]\nApplejack: Howdy!\n[stretching noise]\n[smash]\nChimera's tiger head: [groaning]\nChimera's goat head: [growls] [bleats] Mm, ricotta!\nChimera: [distressed]\nApplejack: Let's go!\n[flames whooshing]\nApplejack: [panting] Are you okay?\nApple Bloom: Thanks to you.\nApplejack: I told you you need your big sister lookin' after you! I'm just glad this wasn't a whole lot worse. I mean, sure we lost the cart and all the pies, but at least you're\u2014 huh, the cart! And all the pies! You actually got them all the way up here? In the dark? Through the Flame Geyser Swamp? Past that monster? ...By yourself?\nApple Bloom: Well... yeah.\nApplejack: Huh, wow. That's mighty impressive! Anypony who can do that on her own, well, she don't need somepony like me babyin' her.\n\n\"Duce Switchell\": Mm-hm! Andouille! This pie's even tastier than my momma's swamp water casserole!\n[Cajun ponies cheering]\n\"Duce Switchell\": Aw, now, momma, don't be like that.\nApplejack: Just remember, you fellas wouldn't be enjoyin' these pies if it weren't for my sister.\nApple Bloom: And my sister!\nApplejack: But this don't change the fact that tryin' to make this delivery on your own was a plumb crazy thing to do!\nApple Bloom: I know...\nApplejack: [scoffs] I bet Granny Smith grounds you for a month for sneakin' out! And if Big Mac, Granny Smith 'n I ever have to be away for the day again... I would totally trust you to stay home and take care of things on your own. I guess I did get a little carried away watchin' over you, and if you hadn't snuck out like you did, maybe I wouldn't have figured that out.\nApple Bloom: Yes! Now that is the kind of 'looking after me' that I can definitely appreciate! So... we're good?\nApplejack: Little sister, we're always good.\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nApplejack: Has anypony heard from Pinkie Pie since yesterday?\nRest of main cast: Nuh-uh.\nRainbow Dash: [yawns] I don't see what's so important we had to meet her here this early.

Hey- whoa!\n[door closes]\nPinkie Pie: Careful!\nTwilight Sparkle: What is all this?\nPinkie Pie: My sister Maud's gonna be here soon, and I need your help taste-testing my rock candy recipes!\nApplejack: Uh, we're happy to help you, Pinkie Pie, but this seems like an awful lot of candy.\nRarity: Even for you.\nPinkie Pie: I may have gone a teensy bit overboard. [squee]\n\n[theme song]\n\nMain cast: [groaning]\nPinkie Pie: Everypony ready for more?\nRainbow Dash: Ugh. My teeth hurt.\nFluttershy: [groans]\nApplejack: I think we've had plenty. And shouldn't you be on your way to pick up Maud from the train station?\nPinkie Pie: Oh, but you've only tried half of the flavors, and we have to choose the perfect ones before she gets here so I have time to make more! [chomps]\nTwilight Sparkle: Maud is your sister. I'm sure she'll love your rock candy. And I'm pretty sure you've made enough. She's only staying for the week.\nPinkie Pie: Aw, it's not just for Maud, silly. I'm making candy for all of us!\nRest of main cast: [groaning]\nPinkie Pie: It's part of a very important, super-duper special tradition that only the closest and bestest of friends can share. We're going to make rock candy necklaces together! [squeals] It all started when Maud and I were fillies on the rock farm. She taught me the Pie family rock candy recipe! It adds a secret ingredient \u2013 [whispering] It's rocks! [speaking normally] \u2013 And she showed me how to string the pieces to make them into a necklace! And once we were done, we'd trade! Maud and I have been trading necklaces back and forth since I moved to Ponyville. They're a sign that we'll always be best friends! [squee]\nApplejack: Aw, what a great tradition.\nRainbow Dash: Hold on. The secret ingredient is rocks?\nPinkie Pie: Yeah. But these are a special kind of rock that Maud discovered.\nFluttershy: Oh, what kind of a rock are they?\nPinkie Pie: Can't tell ya that, silly! [whispering] It's a secret! [speaking normally] Now that Maud is heading out to get her rocktorate in rock science, this may be our last chance to trade them for a really long time. I can't wait for you all to meet her. I just know that my best Ponyville friends and my best sister friend are gonna become bestest friends! We can make bestest-est friend rock candy necklaces together! She expresses herself through fashion just like Rarity, and she's really smart and loves reading just like Twilight! And she's honest, and loves forest things, and is good at games, and... Well, oh, she's awesome!\nRarity: [strained] She sounds amazing, but won't she start worrying if you aren't at the train station when she gets here?\nPinkie Pie: She sure will.

I simply cannot find anything suitable to wear!\nRainbow Dash: I doubt she'll notice what anypony's wearing, so what's the big deal?\nRarity: The big deal is that it will be very difficult to show Maud what a strong fashion presence we have in Ponyville if the most fashion-forward pony here can't keep her hat from falling apart!\nTwilight Sparkle: I think we're all a little nervous about Maud's visit. She's Pinkie Pie's sister, and it's obvious Pinkie really wants us to hit it off. Being able to make those rock candy necklaces together is really important to her. I'm sure everything will be fine\u2013\nPinkie Pie: We're heeeere!\nTwilight Sparkle: Where's Maud?\nPinkie Pie: She's coming!\n[beat]\nRainbow Dash: Uh... you sure?\nPinkie Pie: She's not quite as fast as me.

It's a dress.\nRarity: Oh, yes, of course, I, I just meant, the frock is, just... [splutters out]\nWinona: [barks]\nApplejack: Uh, so this here's Winona. That's Owlowiscious, Tank, Opal, and Angel. Pinkie Pie told us you have a pet, too.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] He's in my pocket.\nFluttershy: Oh, you have a pocket pet? Like a tiny mouse? Or a baby bird? Or a trained butterfly?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] It's a rock. His name is Boulder.\nPinkie Pie: This is going to be the best, most awesome, funnest week ever!

They are crunchy! Yum!\nRainbow Dash: So, uh, Pinkie Pie tells us you like games.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Boulder and I sometimes play a game called 'Camouflage'. It's kind of like hide and seek but way more intense.\n[beat]\nRainbow Dash: Awesome?\n\n[rocks landing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Any luck?\nFluttershy: I truly wish I'd spent more time with Boulder, because I'm having a very hard time remembering what he looks like.\nApplejack: It's like looking for a pebble in a haystack.\nRarity: More like in a pile of pebbles.\nApplejack: Well, you don't have to make it even harder.\nRarity: Ugh! I give up! this is impossible!\nTwilight Sparkle: It'll hurt Maud's feelings if we all stop playing. Besides, look how much fun Pinkie Pie's having.\nPinkie Pie: Is this him? Is this him? Is this him? Is this him?\nTwilight Sparkle: Just a little longer, okay?\nApplejack: Uh, alright, fine...\nRainbow Dash: [simultaneously] Really?\nFluttershy and Rarity: [inaudible comments]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Found him.\nPinkie Pie: Oh! Where was he?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] He was hiding in my pocket.\nRainbow Dash: Oh, come on!\n[Tank's gyrocopter creaking]\nFluttershy: I don't mean to interrupt, but we really should get these little critters home. It's getting awfully late, and they've had a very busy day.\nPinkie Pie: Maud and I had better get going too. I want her to taste the rock candy we're gonna use for our best friends necklaces! Aw, yeah!\nApplejack: She sure is... different from what I expected.\nRainbow Dash: We spent all day digging in the dirt, and he was in her pocket the whole time?!\nFluttershy: On the bright side, Boulder seemed really sweet.\nRainbow Dash: He's a rock!\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on, girls. I'm sure Maud was just nervous about meeting all of us.\nApplejack: Maybe she was just acting a little 'off' because she was shy or somethin'.\nTwilight Sparkle: Exactly. It must be awfully intimidating to meet all of us at once, especially since we're already such good friends.\nRest of main cast: [general agreement]\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe if we spend some time with her one-on-one to try to get to know her better, I'm sure we'll be making those best friend rock candy necklaces in no time.\n\nRarity: Where shall we start? I've chosen a few fabrics that I think will be stunning with y\u2013\nPinkie Pie: Choices, choices, choices!\nRarity: ...Of course, if you don't see anything that speaks to you, I would be happy to suggest\u2013\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I like this one.\nRarity: [laughs] Pinkie Pie didn't tell us you were so funny!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] What do you mean?\nRarity: Oh, well, it's just... I believe that is a dishtowel. [beat] B-b-but it does go very well with your complexion. I'm sure I could work my magic and turn it into something fabulous.\nPinkie Pie: Rarity and my sister working together to design something amazing! This is the best day ever!\nRarity: Perhaps I could sew all of these together and make you something you'd like.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] No thanks.

Start thinking about which flavors you want to put on your best friend rock candy necklace!\nFluttershy: Oh gosh. I'm not sure we're even friends yet.\n\nPinkie Pie: Maud is a total bookworm. She loves poetry!\nTwilight Sparkle: I've got lots of poetry. Do you read anything by Quilland Ink?

That's a very interestin' method you got there. [laughs nervously]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Should I peel another?\nApplejack: No! I mean, nah. I'm sure there's plenty apples in it already.\nPinkie Pie: [sniffs] Can we taste it now?\nApplejack: Sure, why not?\nPinkie Pie: [glugs] Wow! That's the best apple cider I've ever had!\nApplejack: What do you think, Maud?\nMaud Pie: [sips] [deadpan] It tastes like apples.\nPinkie Pie: Told you she was super honest, just like you!\nApplejack: [nervously] We're practically twins, heh.\n\nRainbow Dash: [grunts]\n[thud]\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! Let's see you beat that! Whooaa!\n[distant explosion]\n[splash]\nPinkie Pie: That was amazing!\nRainbow Dash: Whoa. How'd you do that?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I threw it.\nRainbow Dash: I guess you won this one, Maud.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I'm not really into... 'winning'.\nRainbow Dash: [gasps]\n\nPinkie Pie: Great, you're all here! Maud is out looking for rocks, so this is the perfect time for us to set up everything we'll need to make our best friend rock candy necklaces!\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: What's wrong?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, I'm not sure it's the best time to make best friend rock candy necklaces.\nPinkie Pie: Why not?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh...\nRarity: Well, darling, you see...\nFluttershy: You're ever so thoughtful to share your special bonding ritual with us, but, uh...\nPinkie Pie: But what?\nApplejack: [sighs] The truth is, we've all been tryin' real hard to get closer to Maud, but, well... maybe some ponies just don't click the way others do.\nRest of main cast: [muttered agreement]\nApplejack: We just wouldn't feel right makin' somethin' that means we're best friends if, well, we aren't.\nPinkie Pie: [mane deflates] Oh. Okay. If anypony needs me, I'll be in here trying to figure out what to do with two hundred pounds of rock candy.\n[door closes]\n\nRarity: I feel awful! Just awful...\nFluttershy: Maybe we should have just pretended we were friends with Maud.\nTwilight Sparkle: If we didn't tell Pinkie Pie that we hadn't all become the best of friends, I think Maud would have.\nRainbow Dash: Maybe, but who really knows? That pony is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an igneous.\nRarity: Don't you mean \"inside an enigma\"?\nRainbow Dash: Nope. I mean igneous. It's a kind of rock. Ask me how I know that.\n[knocking]\nPinkie Pie: I've come up with just the thing to bring everypony closer together!\n\nPinkie Pie: I call it \"Pinkie-Rainbow-Rari-Twi-Apple-Flutter-Maud Fun Time\"! [squee]\nRainbow Dash: Huh?\nPinkie Pie: It combines everypony's interests into one giant activity that we can all enjoy together and that will totally bring all of my bestest friends together as bestestest friends! You'll need these.\nRainbow Dash: Like I said: Huh?\nPinkie Pie: Probably better for me to show you. Watch this! Applesauce tunnel for Applejack, pretty shiny stuff for Rarity, reading material for Twilight, critter time for Fluttershy...\n[bear roars]\nPinkie Pie: Cupcakes for yours truly... [chomps] and it's a race for Rainbow Dash!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, what is that?!\nPinkie Pie: A rock slide, of course! For Maud! First you climb, then you slide!\nApplejack: I've got a bad feeling about this...\nPinkie Pie: [giggling] Huh? [straining]\n[rocks rumbling]\nRarity: [shrieks]\nFluttershy: Oh, goodness!\nPinkie Pie: [straining]\nApplejack: Watch out!\nPinkie Pie: Huh? [shrieks] Help! [straining]\n[jackhammer sounds]\nRest of main cast: [sighs]\nRainbow Dash: What\u2013 how\u2013 what?!\nMaud Pie: Pinkie Pie, what were you thinking?\nPinkie Pie: I guess I wasn't.\nMaud Pie: I know how important it is to you that your friends become my friends, but I just don't think it's going to happen. I think it would be best if I just go back to the rock farm and spend the rest of the week there. It was nice to meet you all. Makes me happy knowing Pinkie Pie has such good friends.\nPinkie Pie: But... we never even got to make our rock candy necklaces... Wait, Maud! I'll come with you!\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't believe Maud cut her trip short.\nRarity: I can't believe we nearly lost Pinkie Pie to that ridiculous obstacle course.\nFluttershy: Thank goodness Maud was able to reach her in time.\nRainbow Dash: Did you see how fast Maud moved?\nRarity: And the way she smashed that huge rock into dust? How in Equestria did she do that?\nFluttershy: Pinkie Pie was in trouble! Maud would move mountains for her if she had to.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's it! I think I finally realized what we all have in common with Maud! Something that just might be worthy of a very important super-duper special tradition that only the closest and bestest of friends can share!\n\n[train engine noises]\nMaud Pie: Thank you for coming with me. I don't know how long I'll be gone on my rock research trip. I'm glad I still get to spend some time with you before I go.\nPinkie Pie: Me too. I'm sorry I put so much pressure on everypony to bond. I only wanted my friends to get to know my amazing older sister.\n\nPinkie Pie: What are you doing here?\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, we're so sorry we hurt your feelings by not bonding with Maud right away. And Maud, we're sorry that you felt the only way to spare Pinkie Pie's feelings was to leave Ponyville early.\nRest of main cast: Mm-hm.\nApplejack: We've seen how much you care about Pinkie Pie firsthoof.\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie's happiness means as much to us as it does to you, and we're sorry we couldn't see it sooner. The thing that makes us click and creates a special bond between us is how much we all love Pinkie Pie!\nPinkie Pie: Aw, shucks!\nTwilight Sparkle: That's a pretty great thing to have in common, if you ask me. What do you think, Maud?\nMaud Pie: Sure.\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: What's wrong?\nRarity: Sorry, darling. I think we all just thought she'd be a bit more excited about this.\nPinkie Pie: Are you kidding me? I've never seen her more excited in my entire life!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I don't know if you've noticed, but I don't show my enthusiasm for things quite in the same way my sister does.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, we noticed. And we're totally cool with it.\nRest of main cast: [agreement]\n\n[train engine noises]\nTwilight Sparkle: Maud, we'd like to give you something to take on your trip, so that you remember all your friends from Ponyville.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Thank you.\nPinkie Pie: Try not to eat all the candy before you leave! [chewing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Are those all the necklaces Pinkie Pie sent you?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Mm-hm.\nTwilight Sparkle: You haven't eaten any of them?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I don't really like candy. But I do love Pinkie Pie.\nPinkie Pie: [chewing] Mmm!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nSweetie Belle: I have to leave for dress rehearsal soon, Rarity! Is it finished yet?\nRarity: Uh, not quite. I still feel it needs a certain je ne sais quoi. Perhaps it needs... appliqu\u00e9s.\nSweetie Belle: Appliqu\u00e9s?\nRarity: Or sequins.\nSweetie Belle: Sequins!\n[crash]\nRarity: Sweetie Belle, I adore having you help me, truly I do, but...\nSweetie Belle: Guess I got a little carried away. It's just that I know how important it is for you to finish this wardrobe in time for Sapphire Shores and her backup dancers.\nRarity: This is without a doubt my most prestigious order ever. After all, Sapphire Shores is the pony of pop, and her Equestria-wide tour launches in Canterlot next week! Which means she must have these outfits by day after tomorrow at the latest!\nSweetie Belle: But is there time?\nRarity: Barely. But I work well under pressure. Hmm, as long as I stay calm, I'll be fine.\nSweetie Belle: Oh, good! Then maybe you could check the stitching and finish the buttons on the dresses I made for me, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo? I really want them to look perfect, and... I think I need your expertise.\nRarity: My, you've been so much help to me. How could I possibly say no? When do you need them?\nSweetie Belle: Tomorrow night. For the opening night of our show!\nRarity: But, Sweetie Belle, darling! I, I'm behind as it is!\nSweetie Belle: I understand.\nRarity: I suppose... if I got a few more ponies to help me, then maybe...\nSweetie Belle: Oh, thank you thank you thank you thank you! You're the best sister ever! The dresses are right over there! [giggles]\n\n[theme song]\n\nCheerilee: My goodness, girls, it's time! And the audience is almost fully seated! Costumes!\nScootaloo: I can't believe Rarity still isn't here with the costumes.\nSweetie Belle: She's been very busy lately!\nApple Bloom: But how can she still not be here? She's known about this for weeks! Uh... she has known about this for weeks, right?\nSweetie Belle: I kept meaning to ask her, I really did, but I worked so hard on this play. I wrote it especially for the three of us! I directed it, I'm in it, I made the costumes... It's just that this is really my time to shine doing something completely myself, and I really wanted to keep it that way!\nApple Bloom: But we wanted everything to be perfect! All our friends came out to see it tonight!\nCheerilee: Places!\nRarity: Oh, I'm here, I'm here!\nSweetie Belle: [gasps] You made it!\nRarity: Oh, I beg your pardon for cutting it so close, but I made some improvements to your original design, and I had a terrible time with these froofy sleeves. It is for the first play you ever wrote, after all, so I made quite certain it came out just so.\nCheerilee: Places! Hello?\n\n[fanfare playing]\n[applause, oohs and ahhs]\nSweetie Belle: Forsooth and anon, I cometh forthwith and posthaste with glad tidings, miladies.\n\n[cheers]\nApple Bloom: Wow! A standin' ovation!\nScootaloo: I still have goosebumps!\nApple Bloom: This must be like a dream come true for you, huh, Sweetie Belle?\nScootaloo: Ooh, can you imagine if this show was how you got your cutie mark?\nApple Bloom: Which do you think you'd get it for? Writing, directing, or acting?\nSweetie Belle: [deep breath] Let's not get carried away. We've got a whole lobby full of friends waiting to shower us with adoration and praise. Try to be gracious.\nScootaloo: Modest.\nApple Bloom: Classy.\n\n[ponies chattering]\nSweetie Belle: Here we are, the stars of the show!\nApple Bloom: You may tell us how much you loved it now.\nScootaloo: Line forms here!\nSpike: Wow, you guys! I think your sisters would have loved it!\nApple Bloom: Would have?\nSpike: They're sorry, but they had to go help Rarity get Sapphire Shores' wardrobe ready to take to Canterlot in the morning.\nScootaloo: Even Rainbow Dash?\nSpike: Yeah. Rarity fell way behind.\nApple Bloom and Scootaloo: Aww.\nSpike: Aw, cheer up, the show was great! I'll get you some punch.\nSweetie Belle: At least everypony else who was able to stay loved it.\n[ponies chattering]\nSweetie Belle: What did you all like best? The writing, the directing, or the acting?\nLemon Hearts: Oh my, I- I loved the dresses.\nNoteworthy: I liked some of those lines you said.\nSweetie Belle: Oh, really? Which ones?\nNoteworthy: Uh, I don't really remember, but you were wearing a pink taffeta dress with lots of chiffon when you said them! Whoo-ee, that outfit was a dazzler!\nLemon Hearts: I liked that one almost as much as the one with the lacy trim and all the embroidered cuffs! [chuckles]\nNoteworthy: That was a nice one too!\nSweetie Belle: [growls] Isn't there anypony here who remembers anything about the play besides the dresses?!\nCrowd: [general excuses]\nSweetie Belle: [noise of frustration]\n\nFluttershy: All of this is one headpiece?\nRarity: Indeed. This marvelous extravagance is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the entire wardrobe! But alas, without this key hidden stitch, it's just a... I'm trying to think of a nicer way to say 'big bummer'. [sighs] Now perhaps we can all at last take a moment to relax!\n[door opens and closes]\nRarity: Whatever's the matter, Sweetie Belle? Didn't the play go all right?\nSweetie Belle: Not even close.\nRarity: Oh, dear. Was something amiss with the dresses I made you?\nSweetie Belle: No, they were perfect, and that was the whole problem!\nApplejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, and Rainbow Dash: Huh?\nFluttershy: Oh, um, I think maybe I'll go take that moment to relax now.\nRainbow Dash: Heh, sure do feel like relaxing!\nApplejack: Right behind ya!\nSweetie Belle: How could you?! \"Oh, what amazing dresses! Oh, how I love the dresses! Ooh, dresses, dresses, dresses, dresses!\"\n[pause]\nRarity: Oh, so they did like them. [chuckles] You had me worried, you silly filly.\nSweetie Belle: There! I knew it! You did this on purpose! Stealing the spotlight like you always do! It's my fifth birthday party all over again!\nRarity: The... the what now?\nSweetie Belle: Don't act like you don't remember. Or are you trying to prove you're a better actress than me too?!\nRarity: Sweetie Belle, if I did anything to upset you, then--\nSweetie Belle: Admit you made those dresses too good on purpose!\nRarity: I thought they were supposed to be good.\nSweetie Belle: Yes, good. Not jaw-dropping amazing!\nRarity: I only tried to do what I thought you wanted.\nSweetie Belle: Ha!\n[door slams]\n\nSweetie Belle: Ugh, I don't believe it. After everything I put up with all week long! [imitating Rarity] \"Sweetie Belle, get me some red ribbon! No, that's not red, that's cherry! No, that's not red, that's cinnamon!\" [normal, muffled] For Pete's sake, it's all red!\nRarity: [to Opalescence] I should probably go talk to her, hm?\nSweetie Belle: [muffled] At least Sapphire Shores won't be all like \"Ooh, who fetched you that red ribbon? Because I don't care about anything else you made. All I care about is that amazing red ribbon!\"\nRarity: Perhaps waiting would be best.\n\n[bedclothes rustling]\nSweetie Belle: Ughhh! Hgh, hgh, hgh! Nnngh! [growls] Now I can't even sleep! Happy now, big sis?

Why do you have to ruin everything?!\nRarity: [growls]\nPrincess Luna: Enough!\nRarity: [whimpers]\nSweetie Belle: Princess Luna! It's really you! Or am I dreaming?\nPrincess Luna: What do you think?\nSweetie Belle: Let me see. You just rescued me from a maniacal laughing Rarity-cloud. Yeah, probably dreaming.\nPrincess Luna: I understand what you're going through, Sweetie Belle. I too have a sister who often shines more brightly than me, and with this, I have struggled.\nSweetie Belle: Wait, come back! Luna? Can you hear me? Thank you for what you did! Help, Luna! Luuuna!\n[series of thuds]\n[foals cheering]\nSweetie Belle: I remember this. This is my fifth birthday party! I decided to make a grand entrance. I made myself all beautiful, just like my big sister.\n[thud]\nSweetie Belle: Finally, I was perfect, and then went to the stairs to enter like the belle of the ball. When I finally came out of my room, I found the party going on without me.\n[foals cheering]\nSweetie Belle: And I kept posing at the top of the stairs, waiting to be noticed, but all I heard was...\n\"Mint Flower\": These party favors are the coolest! [blows party buzzer]\nLittle Pony 2: Awesome! Where did you get these?\nRarity: Made them myself. And of course, you'll all want cake, won't you?\n[foals cheering]\nLittle Pony 2: You're the greatest, Rarity!\n\"Plum Star\": Who needs a birthday girl when you've got the birthday girl's amazing big sister?\nYounger Sweetie Belle: [sniffling]\nSweetie Belle: That's when I learned 'never try to shine with my big sister around'.\nPrincess Luna: But perhaps you didn't have the whole story.\nSweetie Belle: I thought you said you understood? Luna?\n[stomp]\nLittle Pony 2: Where's Sweetie Belle?\nRarity: I'm sure she'll be along in any moment.\n\"Titania\": [yawns] I'm tired of waiting. I say we get out of here before we all keel over from boredom. Who's with me? Poor Sweetie Belle. Nopony's gonna come to another one of her parties after this fiasco.\nRarity: Don't go! You'll miss out on the, uh, party favors! I was going to save them 'til the end, but...\n\"Mint Flower\": These party favors are the coolest! [blows party buzzer]\nLittle Pony 2: Awesome? Where did you get these?\nRarity: Made them myself. And of course, you'll all want cake, won't you?\n[foals cheering]\n\"Plum Star\": Who needs a birthday girl when you've got the birthday girl's amazing big sister?\nYounger Sweetie Belle: [sniffling]\nRarity: Oh, no-no-no. All of these things were Sweetie Belle's idea. I just assisted with the execution.\nSweetie Belle: I guess Rarity wasn't trying to steal the spotlight. She was trying to save my party. Luna? Luna!\n[splash]\n[dolphins squeaking]\nRarity: Should I hem the cloaks now or wait until I'm there? I could hem them now, but I might have to redo them...\nSweetie Belle: When was this?\nRarity: But if I wait until I'm in Canterlot to hem them, Sapphire Shores might not get the best first impression...\nSweetie Belle: Wait. This must've happened earlier tonight!\nRarity: Ooh... Sapphire Shores is such a big star and such a stickler for details. What if everything's not perfect enough?\nSweetie Belle: Funny, I thought I was the only one who got worried about stuff like that.\nRarity: Oh, buck up, Rarity, stop this foolishness. You've done your best and left nothing to chance! All that's needed now is a good night's rest.\n[click]\nSweetie Belle: [sighs] I hope everything goes alright for her tomorrow.\nPrincess Luna: Hm. How curious you should say that.\n[door opens]\nPrincess Luna: Go. Go see what the future holds if you fail to rein in your worst instincts, as I once did.\n\nRarity: And here it is! The cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me--\nSweetie Belle: Noooo!\nRarity: The pi\u00e9ce de resistance...\nSweetie Belle: Don't! [gasps]\nBackup dancers: [oohing] [gasping]\nRarity: The headdress!\nSapphire Shores: Looks like I made a mistake here.\nRarity: But, but this is impossible! I, I, I checked and rechecked everything! This couldn't have happened!\nSapphire Shores: You sure about that, honey?\nRarity: Please, you must believe me!\nSweetie Belle: Listen to my sister!\nSapphire Shores and Backup dancers: [laughing]\nRarity: [crying]\nSweetie Belle: [screams] I don't wanna see any more!\nRarity: Always check and recheck!\nSapphire Shores: Who all wants to hear a funny story about my ex-costume designer?\n[ponies laughing]\nRarity: Check, recheck, recheck, then recheck!\nSweetie Belle: Make it stop! Princess Luna, can you hear me?!\nFluttershy: Make me a dress, Rarity, please?\nRarity: Go away! You know I don't do that anymore!\n[door slams]\nSweetie Belle: Wake me up, Princess Luna, wake me up, wake me uuuup!\n\nSweetie Belle: [gasping]\n[door opens]\nSweetie Belle: Rarity? [gasps] Oh no! The box is... gone? I'm too late! She left for Canterlot!\n\n[train engine noises]\nSweetie Belle: The key is for you two to distract Rarity long enough for me to put the stitch back in without her noticing.\nScootaloo: If we're not too late already.\nApple Bloom: Oh, my gosh! I can't believe we're goin' to see Sapphire Shores! I'm such a huge fan! I know all her songs!\nScootaloo: 'Get Your Pony On'!\nApple Bloom: Ooh, that's one of my favorites!\nSweetie Belle: This isn't a trip to see Sapphire Shores! It's a trip to save my sister from a horrible future!\nScootaloo: 'Serves Her Right'!\nSweetie Belle: [gasps] How can you say that?! Rarity doesn't deserve that at all!\nScootaloo: No, 'Serves Her Right' is another one of Sapphire Shores' songs!\nApple Bloom: You seriously didn't know that? Don't you listen to her music?!\nSweetie Belle: ...I prefer show tunes.\nScootaloo and Apple Bloom: Ugh.\n\n[pounding music]\nSapphire Shores: Five, six, seven eight, ba-bam!\nRarity: Oh, bravo! Fabulous! Magnifique!\nSapphire Shores: One more time, from the top. Let's not embarrass me in front of my favorite designer this time? And a-one, two, three, four!\n\nSweetie Belle: But you have to let us in! I'm Sapphire Shores' designer's sister! You have to believe us!\nSecurity guard: Kid, the only thing I have to do is make sure Sapphire Shores doesn't get interrupted all day by fans like you.\nSweetie Belle: But I'm not a fan!\nApple Bloom: I am!\nScootaloo: Me too!\nSweetie Belle: Not helping!\n\nBackup dancers: [panting]\nSapphire Shores: Now, that's how I like it! You rocked it, girls! Get some water and be back in ten. Rar-i-ty, come on up here and show me what you brought me. Sapphire wants to see it and to love it!\n\nScootaloo: [straining] Almost...\n[crash]\nScootaloo: Oof!\nSweetie Belle: We've gotta get in there, now!\n\nSapphire Shores: Okay then. Liking what I see so far. So is this the whole shebang?\nRarity: Actually, I saved the best for last!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [screaming]\nRarity: And here it is!\n[thudding]\nSweetie Belle: You gotta see this with the cinnamon ribbon! You'll love it!\nRarity: Sweetie Belle?!\nSapphire Shores: You know her?\nRarity: Uh... [laughs nervously] Ahem. Just a moment!\n[door opens]\n[crash]\n[door closes]\nSweetie Belle: Oh, good! This is just a dream!\nPrincess Luna: Actually, no. This is very much real.\nSweetie Belle: [sighs] Oh, Luna... I wish none of this ever happened... What am I gonna do?\nPrincess Luna: Let's begin with this. And I think I know how you can even improve it.\n\n[door opens]\nRarity: I would like to know what in the wide, wide realm of Equestria this stunt of yours is all about, and I want to know now! Do you have any idea how important this job is to me?\nSweetie Belle: Actually, I do. I was upset at you for stealing the spotlight from me at the play, so I pulled out the center stitch to the headpiece so it would fall apart.\nRarity: What?!\nSweetie Belle: But then I realized I didn't want your future to be ruined forever and ever, so I came back to change it before it was too late! So... here it is. It's all fixed. Please forgive me.\nRarity: Wait... what is this?\nSweetie Belle: Trust me. Sapphire Shores is gonna love it.\n\nSapphire Shores: Rarity, this isn't going to work out. You don't get to my level of success without learning to read the signs, and this situation has bad luck written all over it.\nRarity: I promise you'll absolutely adore the headdress as soon as you see it.\nSapphire Shores: My, it is attractive, but...\nSweetie Belle: Look at the stitching, real close.\nSapphire Shores: Well, I'll be. It's a dolphin! That's my lucky animal! They swim with me in my dreams.\nRarity: Wherever did you come up with the idea for a dolphin?\nSweetie Belle: Oh, it just came to me... in a dream. I'm sorry I got jealous about those dresses. I know now that you were only trying to help.\nRarity: Oh, Sweetie, I forgive you! But I never did get to see your play. Any chance I could catch an encore performance?\nSweetie Belle: Uh, I don't think the play went all that good. To be honest, the costumes were the best part.\nRarity: Awww!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[splashing]\nApple Bloom: Just one more time?

We'll get ya!\n[splash]\nApplejack: [grunts]\n[splash]\nApple Bloom: Granny, I thought you were too afraid of the water to swim! And, and what about your hip?!\nGranny Smith: Well, I reckon it might have been a problem before I had myself a dose of that there Flim Flam Tonic!\nApplejack: I'm not so sure that tonic really does anythin'.\nGranny Smith: Doesn't do anythin'?! What d'you call this? [hums a tune]\nApplejack: I'm glad you're feelin' good, but how do you know it's from the tonic?\nGranny Smith: I looked out at the water this mornin' and I felt the same terrifyin' aches and pains I always do. But one sip of that magic elixir and it all went away! Why, I might even get a head start on my chores! What do you say, Big Mac-a-doo? Up for a little afternoon applebuckin'?\nBig McIntosh: Uh, no.\nGranny Smith: Oh, quit your bellyachin'!\nApple Bloom: Gee, it looks like that tonic works after all! I wonder what's in it.\nApplejack: I think maybe it's time we found out.\n\n[Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic in background]\nApple Bloom: So you're just gonna walk up and ask them how it works?\nApplejack: I guess.

That's that same pony from before!\nApplejack: Hey!\n[thudding]\nApplejack: Now hold it right there, Mister...?\nSilver Shill: Shill. Silver Shill. Ooh, what do you two want?\nApplejack: Our Granny took some tonic and we want to know how it works.\nApple Bloom: Granny couldn't swim before, and now she can. Just like you couldn't walk and now you can. But what are you doin' back here? I mean, if the tonic cured you and all...\nSilver Shill: [gulps]\nApplejack: ...Because he's part of the act! It's time for you to tell the truth! You never needed crutches at all, did ya?\nSilver Shill: I, uh...\n[whistles blowing]\nApplejack: Hey! Huh?\nFlim: Well, if it isn't our most favorite Apple!\nFlam: What brings you back to our humble abode?\nApplejack: You two charlatans sold my Granny a bottle of tonic, and now she's off actin' like a filly again.\nFlim: What's so bad about that?\nApplejack: If she keeps gallavantin' around like a yearlin', she's apt to drop from exhaustion or worse! What's more, I know for a fact that your friend here is dressin' up as a different pony every night so he can pretend to be cured!\nFlam: Well, well, well, that's quite an accusation.\nFlim: But let's say that it's true...\nFlam: Hypothetically...\nFlim: Theoretically...\nFlam: As I understand, your Granny was a famous aquapony.\nFlim: The star of the show, once upon a time.\nFlam: But hasn't set so much as a hoof in the water since.\nApplejack: Until today, that's right.\nFlim: Well, then even if our tonic were nothing more than a mixture of apple juice and beet leaves...\nFlam: Hypothetically...\nFlim: Theoretically...\nFlam: The fact is that Granny is happier now than before she tried it.\nApplejack: I guess...\nFlim: So, the question is...\nFlam: Do you really want to be the pony who takes all that happiness away?\nApplejack: I...\nApple Bloom: There you are! I've been lookin' all over! Did you find out what's in the tonic?\nApplejack: Honestly, Apple Bloom... as long as it works, I... don't suppose it really matters.\nApple Bloom: Well, if it doesn't matter to you, then it doesn't matter to me either, sis.\nFlim: That's the spirit!\nFlam: Come back anytime!\n\n[splashing]\nApple Bloom: Hey, Granny!

And now, thanks to that Flim Flam Tonic, I don't have to!\n[splash]\nApple Bloom: Granny, you think I could be an aquapony like you?\nGranny Smith: Of course you can, sapling. There's nothin' to it but to do it!\nApple Bloom: Well, the Ponyville swim meet is comin' up. We could enter together! A legendary water pony like you? We'd be a cinch to win!\nGranny Smith: Mm, ee, uh, I don't know... Bein' back in the water is one thing, but a competition is a pony of a different color.\nApple Bloom: Oh. Okay.\nApplejack: I don't know, Granny. A swim meet sounds pretty safe. And after all, if that tonic lets you swim in a river and a swimmin' hole, a pool should be no problem at all.\nGranny Smith: Well, I'll be a tart turnover, you are right! All we need now is more tonic!\n\n[ponies chattering]\nFlam: Welcome, friends, and step right up! The next show starts in five minutes!\nFlim: But why not buy your tonic now and avoid the rush?\nFlam: Right this way, good sir!\nGranny Smith: We'll take the whole case!\n[bits clinking]\n\"Jinx\": Are you saying this stuff actually works?\nApplejack: It seems to work for Granny.\nFlim: You heard it here first, folks!

With the routine we've been workin' on, I'll be a plum puddin' if we don't win this thing!\nApplejack: Uh... good luck, then!\nGranny Smith: Luck? Pfft, who needs luck? We got tonic on our side!\nFlam: Flim Flam's Magical Curative Tonic!\nFlim: Get your Applejack-approved tonic! Granny Smith drinks it \u2013 why shouldn't you?\n[ponies cheering]\nApplejack: [sighs] Right.\nGranny Smith: Now, if'n you'll excuse us, we got some swimmin' to do!\n[splashing]\n[ponies cheering]\nApplejack: Well, I'll be...\n[cameras clicking]\nSnappy Scoop: That was some of the most amazing aquabatics I've ever seen! How in Equestria did you do it? Hard work? Lots of practice? [clicks camera]\nGranny Smith: Yeah, but mostly it's the tonic!\nFlim: That's Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic, to be precise.\nFlam: Buy it now while supplies last.\n[ponies chattering]\nApplejack: What are you doin' here?\nSilver Shill: Oh, things are going so well, Flim and Flam gave me a promotion! Just made my first bit as a salespony. No more costumes for this pony. [beat] This is more of a uniform.\nApplejack: If you say so.\nSilver Shill: I used to wonder if I was doing the right thing. You know, pretending to be cured, basically lying to folks about this tonic. But thanks to you, I realized that sometimes honesty isn't the best policy.\nApplejack: Thanks to... me?\nApple Bloom: With Flim Flam's magical Curative Tonic, my Granny can do anything! Just ask Applejack!\n[cameras clicking]\nApplejack: No! This has gotta stop! If ponies keep believin' that tonic can do things it can't, who knows what'll happen?\nSilver Shill: Maybe something like that?\nApplejack: [gasps] Granny! What in blazes does she think she's doin'?!\nApple Bloom: Granny's gonna break the Equestria high divin' record!\nApplejack: Land sakes! [catching breath] [gasps]\n[whip cracking noises]\nGranny Smith: [yelps] Now what in tarnation did you do that for?!\nApplejack: That was the most fool-pony thing I've ever seen anypony do in all my life! You can't do a dive like that!\nGranny Smith: Oh, quit your fussin'! I had enough tonic to do a dive ten times as high!\nFlim: Twenty times, by my count.\nFlam: Thirty, with a favorable breeze.\nApplejack: I hate to disappoint everypony, but there's no way Granny could have made that dive, because this tonic is a fake!\n[crowd gasps]\n\"Jinx\": But you gave it your stamp of approval!\nRainbowshine: Are you saying you lied?\nApplejack: ...I am.\n[crowd gasps]\nApplejack: I didn't mean to! But everypony seemed so much happier, I couldn't bring myself to tell you when I found out the tonic wasn't real. I know it was wrong. I just hope, with time, I can win back everypony's trust.\nApple Bloom: But if the tonic is a fake, then how come Granny can swim again, and what about all that aquabatics stuff we just did?\nApplejack: I reckon sometimes you can forget what you're capable of, and it just takes a little extra confidence to remember that it was inside of you all along. But tellin' ponies your tonic can do things it can't is just wrong!\nFlim: But you just said it boosts confidence!\nFlam: And that's not all it does, folks\u2013\nSilver Shill: Yes, it is! In fact, it's not a tonic at all! I know, 'cause I helped make it! Watching Applejack save Granny and then admit to lying, well, that made me realize I was making ponies believe in a thing that just wasn't so!\nApplejack: Believin' in somethin' can help you do amazin' things. But if that belief is based on a lie, eventually it's gonna lead to real trouble.\nSilver Shill: Thank you, Applejack. I got this through dishonest means. That was a mistake I won't be making again! I'd like you to have it, as a reminder of how you helped me finally see the truth.\nApplejack: I don't know...\nSilver Shill: Oh, don't worry. I'll track down the pony I sold that worthless tonic to and give him another bit to replace this one! Honest.\nApplejack: I'm sorry, Granny. I hope this doesn't mean you'll stop swimmin'.\nGranny Smith: Why in tarnation would I do that? I just can't believe those two salesponies had me believin' I could near fly! Hey, where'd they go?\n\nApplejack: Bein' honest sure gets hard when it seems like the truth might hurt somepony you care about. But I think believin' a lie can end up hurtin' even more. Maybe some ponies don't care about that \u2013 but I sure ain't one of them. Now you take it easy there, Granny!\nGranny Smith: Oh, I plan to!

Reading and highlighting is the foundation of any good study method.

I am now modeling the rather unattractive, and frankly itchy, original Wonderbolts flying costume. Fortunately, thanks to the vision of Flair d'Mare, the Wonderbolts ensemble became more streamlined in a wonderfully breathable fabric. Of course, there were fashion hits... and misses. Just look at those dreadful bell-bottoms. What were ponies thinking?\nPinkie Pie: I dunno. I bet General Flash rocked these thangs!\nRainbow Dash: [yelps] Pinkie, you're real!\nPinkie Pie: Of course I'm real!

How much time you got?\nRainbow Dash: Twelve hours.\nApplejack: Oh, then you are up a creek.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, I think we should just go back to old-fashioned studying.\nFluttershy: What about our play?\nRarity: Just look at these costumes! Surely something resonates with your inner Wonderbolt!\nApplejack: And Granny Smith discovered the first granny smith in Fillydelphia, when she was just a filly!\n\n[Pinkie Pie]\nCommander Easyglider was the real cream of the crop\u2014\n\nCommander Easyglider was the real cream of the crop\u2014\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie, stop rapping!

No rapping, no cards, no costumes, no play, and no apples! I am never gonna pass this test, ever! Just forget it!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [panting] Rainbow, I'm sorry about all that! We didn't mean to overwhelm you!\nRainbow Dash: It's okay. You were just trying to help. It's just too bad I'm too dumb to learn anything.\nTwilight Sparkle: You are not dumb! You just learn differently!\nRainbow Dash: If by \"differently\" you mean \"not at all\", then you're totally right.\nTwilight Sparkle: No, that's totally wrong.\nRainbow Dash: See? Wrong again.\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know anypony that's read more Daring Do books than you.\nRainbow Dash: Well, that's not going to get me into the Wonderbolts.\nTwilight Sparkle: And your knowledge of jokes and pranks is only rivaled by Pinkie.\nRainbow Dash: Great. My years of being a class clown prevented me from actually learning how to learn!\nTwilight Sparkle: That's not what I meant. You're smart, creative, inventive, and\u2013 ugh! Hey! I know you're upset, but you don't need to\u2014\n[Rainbow Helicopter blades whirring]\nTwilight Sparkle: Whoa... I almost slammed into that!\nRainbow Dash: I know. You were jabbering on so much you didn't even notice.\nTwilight Sparkle: But how did you notice? You were listening and talking to me the whole time!\nRainbow Dash: Ha-hah, you're such a rookie. An experienced flyer like me knows how to multitask.\nTwilight Sparkle: While you fly?\nRainbow Dash: It's essential! Yes, I was paying attention to you, but was also scanning the sky and the ground for any problems.\nTwilight Sparkle: Really?\nRainbow Dash: Flying's not just flying!\n[sound of VHS rewinding]\nRainbow Dash: In order to stay safe in the sky, I've got to hear and see everything down to the littlest details. For instance, I saw Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo come out of Sugarcube Corner, and from the looks of it, they had carrot cupcakes with sprinkles. And I'm thinking Big Mac sold a huge order of apples to Filthy Rich, 'cause I heard him give a very hearty\u2014\nBig McIntosh and Rainbow Dash: \"Eeyup\".\nRainbow Dash: I always make note of everything when I fly. No biggie.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Oh, my gosh!\nRainbow Dash: What?\nTwilight Sparkle: Gotta go!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, I get it. I wouldn't want to hang out with a loser like me either. [sad groan]\n[thunder rumbles]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks for meeting me, everypony.\nApplejack: What is it, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: We have to help Rainbow Dash.\n[telescope creaks]\nFluttershy: Yes, but how?\nRarity: We've tried every kind of studying. My way, your way...\nTwilight Sparkle: But we haven't tried Rainbow Dash's way.\nPinkie Pie: Hmm, I'm intrigued.\n[records scratching]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay. Listen up, ponies, here's the plan. [unintelligible whispering]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey, Rainbow. Wanna go for a fly?\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Sure. Got nothing better to do. Didn't we just do this?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, but like you said, I'm such a newbie, I need all the practice I can get.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, well, I'm sure you'll become a great flyer in no time. After all, you're good at everything.\nTwilight Sparkle: So... what's going on?\nRainbow Dash: Oh, nothing. Just getting my dreams crushed.\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh... read any good books lately?\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Just history books. I'd tell you what they were about, but my brain is as dry as a rock.\nTwilight Sparkle: Speaking of rocks, did you know Pinkie Pie grew up on a rock farm? [short nervous laugh]\nRainbow Dash: Maybe I'll go work there as I have no other plans for the rest of my life.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, come on now, Rainbow. You can't give up on your dream!\nRainbow Dash: Seems my dream has given up on me. Maybe I'll learn to shine shoes, sell hats, dig ditches...\nTwilight Sparkle: Or maybe you'll be a Wonderbolt.\nRainbow Dash: Twilight, give it up! I have.\nTwilight Sparkle: So, what do you remember about that flight?\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Nothing important. Except after Luna was banished to the moon, Celestia needed protective forces, so Earth, unicorn, and Pegasi formed the E.U.P. Guard of the Protective Pony Platoons.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes...?\nRainbow Dash: [getting happier] And, at the celebration of the first Celestial year of peace, an elite flying squadron performed, headed by General Firefly, who later named the group the Wonderbolts!\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh-huh...?\nRainbow Dash: Commander Easyglider established flight choreography that is still used by the Wonderbolts today!\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes!\nRainbow Dash: I... I know the history! I know it all! But how in Equestria did that happen?\nTwilight Sparkle: You learned it!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, I got that! But how?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, on our first flight, I discovered that you catalog everything that happens all around you when you're flying, without even thinking about it! Don't you see?\n[sound of VHS rewinding]\nTwilight Sparkle: I made use of your special skills by enlisting everypony to help you learn the history of the Wonderbolts!\n\nFluttershy: I, Princess Celestia, banish you, Princess Luna, to the moon.\nRarity: Noooooo!\nApple Bloom: Earth!\nSweetie Belle: Unicorn!\nScootaloo: Pegasus!\nApple Bloom: E!\nSweetie Belle: U!\nScootaloo: P!\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\nFluttershy: Let us celebrate our first Celestial year of peace!\nPinkie Pie: Yeah, let's party! I'm General Firefly! Gee, my costume is itchy and unattractive, but I'm gonna assemble an awesome flying team!\n[cannon exploding]\nPinkie Pie: I'll call them... the Wonderbolts!\nRarity: Streamlined style by Flair d'Mare!\nPegasus Stallion #1: Admiral Fairweather!\n\"Downdraft\": Colonel Purple Dart!\nSassaflash: Admiral Fairy Flight!\nPegasus Stallion #2: General Flash!\n\"High Note\": Commander Easyglider!\nFluttershy: The history of the Wonderbolts!\n\nRainbow Dash: Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh! Thank you! Thank you all so much!\nTwilight Sparkle: You're welcome, but it all came from you. You learned without knowing you're learning. Your main focus is flying, but then your brain is also absorbing lots of other information! It's actually really brilliant!\nRainbow Dash: Ha, I always knew I was brilliant!\nMain cast: [laughing]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash finally learned the history of the Wonderbolts, but she's not the only pony that needed a lesson; I needed to learn something just as important. One way of learning isn't better than another. After all, every pony is unique and individual.\n[papers rustling]\n[stamping]\nRainbow Dash: Yeeeaah! Whoo!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nPinkie Pie: [squeals] Yes! Best day ever! We're all going to the Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange! And not just going \u2013 we're accompanying a princess on an official royal duty!\nTwilight Sparkle: Please, it's not that big of a deal. There always has to be a princess at the Exchange. Last year was Princess Cadance, this year it's me. It's just a formality. I'm sure none of the other ponies will even notice I'm here.\n[crowd cheering]\nCrowd Pony 1: Wow, look over there, a princess!\nCrowd Pony 2: Oh, this is amazing!\nApplejack: Could be wrong, but I think they might've noticed.\nTwilight Sparkle: [laughs nervously]\n\n[theme song]\n\nFluttershy: Oh, my goodness!\nRarity: You said it. The Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange is simply divine. You can get anything you want here!\nApplejack: If'n you got the goods to trade for it.\nSpike: [grunts] Wha? Nooo! Thanks, Twilight. Whew. One ding, nick or dent, and this Power Ponies comic book wouldn't be in perfect mint condition anymore. And if you want to trade for a mint comic, you gotta have a mint comic.\n[crowd murmuring]\nApplejack: I guess a pony who's here on official princess business has to expect a little fussin'.\nTwilight Sparkle: But all I'm supposed to do is settle disagreements over whether a trade is fair or not. And since the rule is that a trade is fair as long as both ponies get what they want, there's never been a disagreement. So there's really no reason for anypony to treat me as anything special. Hi! Can I help you? [sighs]\nRainbow Dash: There's a pony here who's got a signed first edition of Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Statue, and I'm gonna get it! I've been able to get first editions of all of the Daring Do books, except this one! Nopony's ever put together a whole set, and I'm gonna be the first! If it hasn't been traded yet... It's the only one in all of Equestria!\nFluttershy: Oh no! I'd really hate to see you disappointed. I did want to trade this bear call I've got for a bird whistle, but getting that book seems so important to you, so if you need me to help you first...\nRainbow Dash: Normally I'd say I don't need any help, but you're right. This is really important. I've gotta get that book!\nApplejack: Well, I'm off to take a gander at some of the vintage stalls.\nRarity: Did you say vintage? Why, old and rare items are so in style right now! I'm hoping to get a vintage item as well. I just hope I brought enough to trade.\nApplejack: I know what you mean, Rarity. Hey! Why don't we pool our trade stashes?\nRarity: Pool?\nApplejack: That way, if one of us finds somethin' real valuable she can't live without...\nRarity: [gasps] She'll definitely be able to get it! Who could say no to exchanging a single object for such a huge assortment of items? Oh, yes! That is absolutely brilliant! I'm so glad I have a friend like you, Applejack.\nApplejack: I feel the same way.\nRarity: Then let's go shopping!\n\nPinkie Pie: Um, shouldn't your princessness be headed to the royal box seats?\nTwilight Sparkle: I may be the princess on duty, but I don't think that means I have to sit up there all alone doing nothing. Ever since I became a princess, Celestia's been sending me more books to read than ever. The library's overflowing, so I figured while we're here, I might as well trade away some books I don't need anymore.\nPinkie Pie: Mm-hm!\n\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] There it is! The first edition of Daring Do and the Sapphire Statue! It hasn't been traded yet! [to stallholder] Lucky for you, because I've brought my most valuable possession to trade for it: My lucky horseshoe!\n\"Teddie Safari\": I don't want it.\nRainbow Dash: What?!\n\"Teddie Safari\": It's just a rusty old horseshoe. That's not worth anything to me.\nFluttershy: But, but how is Rainbow Dash going to get the book she really wants?\n\"Teddie Safari\": Well, she's not.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs]\n[thud]\n\"Teddie Safari\": Unless... she can get me that.\n[Orthros growling and barking]\nFluttershy: Aww, an Orthros! How cute!\n\"Teddie Safari\": The pony running the ancient beasts stall doesn't want anything I've got. But if you can get me the Orthros, I'll trade you the book for it.\nRainbow Dash: You got it! [to Fluttershy] I don't know how, but somehow, we're gonna get that Orthros.\n\nRarity: Oh, Applejack, I am so glad I found you.\nApplejack: Me too! You're not gonna believe it!\nApplejack and Rarity: [simultaneously] I found a super valuable vintage item I just have to have, and all it's gonna cost is all our stuff! [beat] Uh-oh.\n\nRarity: So, where is this valuable vintage item you want to trade everything we have for?\nApplejack: There!\nRarity: Where?\nApplejack: Right there!\nRarity: But... that's a dented old pie tin.\nApplejack: A dented vintage pie tin. The metal they used to fashion this one helps cook the pies up to five seconds faster! They don't make 'em like this anymore!\nRarity: I'm so glad you showed that to me, darling...\n[clatter]\nRarity: ...because once you see what I've found, you won't want to waste our trade goods on that. [giggles] Just look at this gorgeous vintage brooch. It's one of a kind!\nApplejack: It looks exactly like the one you're already wearin'.\nRarity: Well, yes, they may look the same, but I know it's older, and that's what makes it so much more divine!\nApplejack: But that doesn't make a lick of sense! Why, I'd wager if I switched them up, you wouldn't even know the difference!\nRarity: Oh, don't be silly, of course I would!\n[brooches clinking]\nApplejack: So which is the vintage one?\nRarity: That one, of course.\nApplejack: Hah, you're bluffin'!\nRarity: Am I? How can you tell?\nApplejack: Well... because... [groans] I can't, 'cause the one you wanna waste our whole stash on is exactly the same as the one you already got! There's no way anypony would notice the difference!\nRarity: I'd say it's a lot more likely they'd notice that than some dented tin that cooked a pie a whole two seconds faster!\nApplejack: It's five seconds faster!\nRarity: [growls]\nApplejack: [growls]\n\n[Orthros growling]\nRainbow Dash: [gulps]\n[Orthros barking]\nFluttershy: Yes, such a good two-headed boy. Yes, you are!\n[various creature noises]\nCratus: Stop that! C'mon, don't you start now, too!\nRainbow Dash: Okay, I can see you're busy, so I'll give it to you straight. I need to trade this horseshoe for... that.\nCratus: Nope.\nRainbow Dash: Aww.\nCratus: Down, boy! Watch out for the lamp!\n[crash]\nCratus: Well, I could use another lamp.\n\nRainbow Dash: A whole stand filled with Discord-shaped lamps? Seriously?!\nFluttershy: They really do have everything at the Traders Exchange.\nRainbow Dash: Will you trade a lamp for my horseshoe so I can trade it for an Orthros and get my book?\nStellar Eclipse: No. But I'd trade it for an antique chicken.\nRainbow Dash: Great! [beat] What's an antique chicken?\n\n\"Match Game\": Oh, I got all kinds of antique chicken statues. I got your blue hens, speckled grays, your-\nRainbow Dash: Okay, cool! So will you trade one for a horseshoe so I can trade it for a lamp and then trade it for an Orthros so I can get my book?\n\"Match Game\": Well, lemme think... Uh, no.\nFluttershy and Rainbow Dash: Aww.\n\"Match Game\": But I'd gladly trade one of my chickens for a crystal chalice.\n\nRainbow Dash: [panting] Hold on a sec. [inhales] We need a crystal chalice to trade for a chicken to trade for a lamp to trade for an Orthros. So what are you willing to trade for it? I'm guessing it's gotta be some crazy thing way across the Exchange.\n\"Amethyst Gleam\": Actually, I could use a slightly rusty old horseshoe.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, like where am I gonna find\u2013 wait, I've got one of those! Now that we've got the chalice, this is gonna be a cinch!\nFluttershy: Do you really think so?\nRainbow Dash: All we gotta do is bring this thing to the chicken stand and we are\u2013\n[crystal fracturing]\nFluttershy and Rainbow Dash: [screaming]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: You want me to trade all my books for a broken pen? Alright, fine. You got yourself a\u2013\nPinkie Pie: Stop! What are you doing?!\nTwilight Sparkle: I was trying to get rid of all the books I don't need anymore.\nPinkie Pie: For that? Do you reaaaaally want that?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, not really, but I'm running out of library space, so\u2013\nPinkie Pie: Ohmygosh, ohmygosh, ohmygosh! I can't believe that almost happened! But luckily, it didn't happen, thanks to me.\nTwilight Sparkle: What are you talking about?\nPinkie Pie: According to the rules of the Exchange, a trade is only fair if both ponies end up with something they want. You can't break the rules! Did anypony see you do it? I don't think anypony saw! [to \"Chirpy Hooves\"] But you're not gonna say anything, are you?! Haha, I'm just kidding! Or am I?! Sometimes I can't even tell! [laughs]\nTwilight Sparkle: Y'know, if you want to go check out the rest of the Exchange and trade whatever you brought...\nPinkie Pie: Nope, I just came to pony-watch! I'm not going anywhere. I won't let you make a mistake like that again! Hey, everypony, step right up! Do not walk! Gallop over here for your chance to trade for authentic, one-of-a-kind, official princess merchandise!\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\n\nRainbow Dash: Well, that took forever.\nFluttershy: I just hope it looks okay.\n\"Match Game\": This is perfect!\n[smashing crystal]\nFluttershy and Rainbow Dash: [gasps]\n\"Match Game\": Perfect for the broken chalice mosaic I'm making! Alright, so what kind of antique chicken do you want? I got speckled, brown, gray... [continues under]\nRainbow Dash: Oh no! The pony we're supposed to trade the chicken statue to didn't tell us what kind he wanted! Okay, look. I'm fast. I'll fly over to the lamp stand and find out what kind of chicken he wants. Just don't let anypony trade for any chicken while I'm gone, okay?\nFluttershy: Um, well, okay! Um, I can do that, I think. [to Crusoe Palm] Um, well, maybe you shouldn't get one of those? You know... unless you really want to...\nRainbow Dash: [groans] Beat it! You go. I'll stay here.\n\nRarity: Well, since we can't both get what we want, I will be the better friend. You take our trade goods and get what you want.\nApplejack: I'm an amazin' friend! So even though it's for somethin' that don't seem valuable at all, you take our stash.\nRarity: How dare you let me get what I want. What kind of friend do you think I am? You are going to get what you want!\nApplejack: No, you are!\nRarity: No, you are!\n\nRainbow Dash: Hello! [tapping] We got the kind of chicken you asked for! Hello? Where's the pony running this joint? 'On break'?! [groans]\n\nPinkie Pie: These books made Twilight the princess she is. Before that, she was nothing \u2013 a big, fat zero!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey!\nPinkie Pie: Then she read these books, and voila! Princess! So who wants to start the bidding?\n[crowd chattering excitedly; 'Me', etc.]\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, just a moment, please! Pinkie, I appreciate your help and all, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this. Nopony should trade for my books just because I'm a princess. I'm not better than anypony else!\nPinkie Pie: [hushed] I know you're not better than everypony! Just leave this to me! [to crowd, normal] Did I mention that Princess Twilight got these books from Princess Celestia?\nFleur De Verre: Whoa, wait, you don't mean\u2013\nPinkie Pie: Oh, that's right! Double princess!\n[crowd chattering excitedly]\n\nFluttershy: There he is!\nRainbow Dash: Look, I know it's your break and all, but you've gotta open your stand so we can trade you for a lamp!\nStellar Eclipse: [stomach rumbles] Sorry, girls. Been trading all day. My belly's tellin' me it's time to eat an oatburger.\nRainbow Dash: Oh come on, please?\nFluttershy: Pretty pretty please?\nStellar Eclipse: Sorry, belly says 'no'.\nRainbow Dash: But the Exchange ends at sundown!\nStellar Eclipse: No!\nRainbow Dash: I've got an idea. Next! Next! Next! Next! Next!\n\nFluttershy and Rainbow Dash: [straining]\nRainbow Dash: We're home free!\n[thump]\nRainbow Dash: As long as this thing doesn't drown us in slobber.\nFluttershy: Oh, he's just an affectionate little two-headed fellow. Aren't you, little boy?\n\nApplejack: No, I insist. You go fetch what you want, 'cause that's the kind of tried and true friend I am.\nRarity: Well! I am way too generous to let you out-friend me like that!\n\nRainbow Dash: We gotta hurry! [gasps] We're never gonna get to the Daring Do stand through this crowd in time!\nFluttershy: [blows bear call]\nRainbow Dash: Come on!\nFluttershy: My bear call!\nRainbow Dash: We gotta go!\nFluttershy: Of course. It's just a bear call. There's nothing I could have traded it for that's more valuable to me than you.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Okay, the Exchange is almost over, but we did it. We traded a crystal chalice for an antique chicken...\nFluttershy: And the chicken for a lamp...\nRainbow Dash: And the lamp for an Orthros, just like you asked.\n[Orthros barks]\nRainbow Dash: So there you go! Now where's my book?\n\"Teddie Safari\": Yeah, you know, the thing is... I don't really want an Orthros anymore.\nFluttershy: But... what do we do now?\nRainbow Dash: [groans]\n[thump]\n\n[Orthros panting]\nFluttershy: Oh goodness, oh goodness!\nRainbow Dash: Argh! Ugh...\nFluttershy: Good boy!\nRainbow Dash: Hey! You said you wanted an Orthros!\n\"Teddie Safari\": I've been watching that thing over at the ancient beast booth! It's crazy! I don't want one in my house!\n[Orthros growls]\nFluttershy: There, there, that's a good Orthros. You just have to know how to train them. With a little patient training and a big slobber mop, they can be a wonderful household pet.\n\"Teddie Safari\": [laughing] All right, all right. I'll trade you.\nRainbow Dash: Yes!\n\"Teddie Safari\": If she comes and stays with us in Manehattan until it's trained!\nFluttershy: Gosh, training an Orthros takes a long time. I'll probably be gone from Ponyville for... I don't even know how many moons! But... if that is what you really want...\n\"Teddie Safari\": So we got a fair deal?\nRainbow Dash: Of course it's a deal! Yeah-eah, whoo! [squeals] I did it, I did it! Fluttershy, can you believe it? Oh no. what did I do?!\nPinkie Pie: Who's got something valuable enough to trade for Princess Twilight's princess books that she got from Princess Celestia? Did I say \"princess\"?\nMinuette: Over here, over here!\nPinkie Pie: Oh, come on! These are the books the princess would sit up with all night, with nothing to read by but the light of her own horn! Ooh, now that looks fun\u2013 but not fun enough! These are the books that made Twilight the princess she is! So who's got what it takes to trade for them?\nCrowd Pony 3: Well, when you put it like that...\nCrowd: [various disappointed noises]\nPinkie Pie: Wait, stop, come back! Uh, these books aren't that great... [giggles nervously]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, yes, they are.\nPinkie Pie: But I thought you wanted to get rid of them!\nTwilight Sparkle: None of those ponies had anything valuable enough to trade for my books. Not because these books belong to a princess, but because they helped make me who I am. Just like you said. This was the one I was so absorbed in the day Spike decided he owed Applejack a life debt. And this one reminds me of the day I got it \u2013 which was the day I met you. I may not ever need to read these again, but that doesn't mean they don't have value. I realize that now, thanks to you, Pinkie.\nPinkie Pie: I told you I'd take care of everything!\nRainbow Dash: Twilight! I need you to say a trade wasn't fair! Fast!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I've heard what you both have to say, and I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, but my hooves are tied. You said it was a fair trade.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, I said it, but I was wrong! I did want that book, a lot. I said I wanted it more than anything in all of Equestria. But there's no thing that's worth as much to me as a friend. I might have forgotten that for a little bit, but it's true. Which means there's no way this trade can be fair!\n\"Teddie Safari\": Oh, come on, that's... the sweetest thing I've ever heard. Okay, the trade's off!\n[crowd cheering]\nTwilight Sparkle: And with that, I declare this trial, and this year's Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange, over! [bangs gavel]\nPinkie Pie: [in distance] Woo-hoo!\n\nRarity: I know it's not the pie tin you were after, but I hope you like it. It's the rustiest piece of junk I could get.\nApplejack: Well, I took my half of our stash and got you this!\nRarity: Ohhh!\nApplejack: And I know you're gonna love it, 'cause you already have a bunch of ones that look exactly the same sittin' in the drawer doin' nothin'. So that should settle it once and for all which of us is the better friend.\nRainbow Dash: Oh, come on! You both gave up what you wanted to get something for each other! That's the coolest thing a friend can do. Trust me, I know.\nPinkie Pie: Hey, where's your double-doggie?\nRainbow Dash: I traded it for something way better.\nFluttershy: [blows bird whistle]\nConstance: [twittering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, what do you know? My copy of Daring Do and the Sapphire Statue. It's just a beat up old paperback, not a one-of-a-kind first edition...\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] Even better, because I can read this one with all my friends!\nTwilight Sparkle: [giggles]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nPinkie Pie: Hear ye, hear ye!

Hold close this book and through its spell, you'll start a chain reaction, projecting forth whatever beauty you see. Only when true words are spoken will you finally be set free.\"\nSpike: Did it work?\nRarity: Hm, there's only one way to find out.\n[magic zap]\nRarity: [gasps] Oh, my! I thought about making this a much more beautiful spell book, and I have!\n[magic zap]\nRarity: Dear, dear Spike! Here I was about to give up, but like a true friend, you've come through with flying colors! Come! We must find the puppeteer right away, so that I may provide him with the most fabulous theater he's ever imagined! Or, should I say, that I've ever imagined.\n\nClaude: Ah, Miss Rarity, come to see the show, I presume? You'll notice I had to make do in light of your recent failure to produce a functioning theater.\nRarity: Oh, but I think you'll find the new one I've created will be much more to your liking!\nClaude: [mumbling] Ah, well, it is gorgeous, but that was never the problem now, was it? Oh, well, this one does seem to travel. Plenty of room for my puppets... I say, Miss Rarity, I don't know how you managed to do so in such a short amount of time, but you seem to have redeemed yourself. How did you manage to do so in such a short time?\nSpike: As a matter of fact, she used a s\u2013\nRarity: A good designer never reveals her tricks.\n\nRarity: Thank you again, Spike, for being such a dear friend and finding this book for me!\nSpike: My pleasure. Well, guess I can return it now that the fair's over.\nRarity: Oh, yes, of course. I've made my creative contribution as I'd hoped to do, and all is well! Uh, then again, perhaps I should keep it just a skotch longer... You don't mind, do you, Spike?\nSpike: Of course not! See you tomorrow! [to Owlowiscious] What? She'll keep it for a few more hours, no harm in that.\n\n[distant magic zaps]\nSpike: [whistling]\n[knocking]\nSpike: Rarity?\n[muffled magic zaps]\nSpike: Whoa!\nRarity: Spike, I'm so glad you're here!\nSpike: Whoa! Are... you okay?\nRarity: Oh, I've never been better! This book you've given me is amazing! Why, I, I, I, I've been up all night just creating and creating and creating and creating! I've completed my fall line for the next fifteen seasons!\nSpike: Wow!\nRarity: But then I started thinking, 'why stop there'? Oh, Spike, I've always thought this town of ours could use a few beautifying upgrades, and with this book, I can make that happen with such ease! You will support me in this endeavor by letting me keep the book just a little longer?\nSpike: Of course I will!\nOwlowiscious: [hoots nervously]\n\nSpike: [panting] What do you say we get a little breakfast before we get started?\nRarity: No time for breakfast! I want to get started right away!\nSpike: Technically, we do have time, because with that book held close, you can just make things\u2013 Rarity?\nRarity: Now, this is exactly what I'm talking about! Why, that cart hasn't an ounce of stylish flair!\n[magic zap]\nGranny Smith: My eyes playin' tricks on me again?\nApplejack: What in rhubarb pie just happened?\nRarity: Isn't it gorgeous?\nSpike: It's amazing! You should ask Applejack if she wants you to give all the Apple family carts a makeover!\nRarity: Oh, I don't really think I need to ask permission, darling. Everyone loves surprises, especially when they're gorgeous ones!\nSpike: You're right! Everypony does love surprises.\nRarity: [hushed] We shouldn't even tell anypony that it's me who's behind all the fabulous changes I'll be making! [giggles] Won't that be a fun little secret for the three of us to share?\nSpike: The... three of us?\nRarity: You, me, and the book, of course. My marvelous, marvelous book!\nSpike: ...Of course.\nRarity: Promise me you won't say a word to anypony?\nSpike: [muffled] You got it!\nRarity: I knew I could count on you, Spike. And I also know just what I want to do next!\n\nRainbow Dash: [sounds of exertion] Take that! And that! [grunting] [laughs]\n[magic zap]\nRainbow Dash: What in the... Get... it... off... me! [grunts]\nRarity: I've always thought Rainbow Dash could use a little more glamor, and now look at her! Cloud-busting with style! [short laugh] Moving on!\nSpike: She'll be fine. It's just a dress. Uh, wait for your favorite dragon!\n[crash]\nRainbow Dash: [exhales]\n\n[birdseed pouring]\nFluttershy: La la-la la-la la-la la la... There you go, Mr. Robin!\nMr. Robin: [chirping]\nFluttershy: Don't you look so content in your little house\u2013\n[magic zap]\nFluttershy: [gasps] Oh, my goodness!\nMr. Robin: [distressed chirping]\nFluttershy: You're lost? No, not that way, that looks like it's the door to a... bedroom. Try that one over there. No, no, that leads to a...\n[door slams]\nFluttershy: Shoe closet? Oh, dear. Maybe try the staircase? Oh, no-no-no, the other staircase.\nRarity: Isn't it gorgeous?\nSpike: It's probably the most beautiful birdhouse ever created.\nRarity: Go on.\nSpike: I'm just not sure how the bird feels about it.\nRarity: Pfft, what does a bird know about architectural design? What matters is what you think, Spike. And you love it. Don't you?\nSpike: Of course I do. It's so... [beat] Rarity.\nRarity: It is, isn't it? Ooh!\n[thunk]\n\n[foals laughing]\nRarity: Oh, adorable! But it could use a touch of class, don't you think?\nSpike: Oh yeah, definitely.\n[magic zaps]\nRarity: This party doesn't even seem to have a proper theme. Let's do something about that, shall we?\nSpike: You've already made things look really really great. Maybe you should stop while you're ahead?\nRarity: You're right, Spike! There's so much to do elsewhere!\nSpike: Right! Elsewhere...\nRarity: Just one more little thing before we go...\n[abrupt music change]\nRarity: Why, this party is certain to make the society page now. Won't Pinkie Pie be pleased?\nPinkie Pie: Happy, happy day to\u2013 huh?!\n\nRarity: I am simply buzzing with ideas. Simply buzzing!\nSpike: That's great! But, uh, you've been at this for a while now. How 'bout you take a break? Give that brilliant mind of yours a rest?\nRarity: Don't be silly! I'm not going to stop now! Why, I won't stop until every inch of Ponyville has benefited from my creative vision! Starting with you, Spike!\n[magic zap]\nRarity: You look fabulous!\nSpike: All because of you, heh...\nRarity: Anything for my favorite dragon and most supportive friend. Come, there's so much more to do!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Oh no, not you too!\nSpike: What do you mean, not me too?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. Judging by that outfit, I thought for sure you'd\u2013\nSpike: What? This? I just wanted to try out a new look.\n[thud]\nSpike: You like?\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmm... Well, in that case, have you seen anypony suspicious around?\nSpike: Uh, nope.\nMayor Mare: Princess Twilight, the gazebo has been turned into solid crystal, and two ponies are now trapped inside its walls!\nOwlowiscious: [hoots]\nSpike: No! I made a promise to Rarity to keep this to myself!\nOwlowiscious: [hoots]\nSpike: [sighs] But you're right, Owlowiscious. I have to tell. And once I do, I can forget Rarity thinking of me as her most supportive friend... I can forget Rarity thinking of me as a friend at all...\n\nSpike: [sighs] I can't do it. I promised I'd keep all of this between the three of us!\nOwlowiscious: [hoots]\nSpike: Of course it's weird she meant her, me and the spell book. But\u2013 The spellbook! Of course! If I can get it away from her, I bet she won't be able to use its magic anymore! Oh, come on, it's the perfect plan! I... just have to figure out which way she went.\nStallion: I can't see!\n[ponies complaining]\nSpike: I'm thinking she's headed this way.\n\nRarity: [giggling] What do you think you're doing?!\nSpike: Uh, me? I was just, uh... basking in your creative radiance.\nRarity: Oh, Spike, you do say the nicest things.\nSpike: Thanks.\nRarity: Now, where was I? Oh yes! Gold-plated rooftops for everypony!\nOwlowiscious: [hooting]\nRarity: Spike!\nSpike: [chomp]\nRarity: I have just had the most marvelous idea!\nSpike: [gulps] [gasps] Of course you have. You're Rarity.\nRarity: My work here in Ponyville is nearly complete. Don't you think it's time the rest of Equestria benefited from my creative vision?\nSpike: Absolutely!\nRarity: Ooh, I'm thinking we go by chariot! Or, as everyone will soon be calling them, \"Rariot\"! [laughs]\nSpike: Oh, yeah, we should definitely go by\u2013\n[magic zap]\nSpike: Huh?! How... how did you... do that?\nRarity: Why, whatever do you mean?\nSpike: The book! It's\u2013 I mean\u2013 you don't\u2013 it's gone! The book is gone!\nRarity: Gone? Why, it's right there. [gasps] I need my book, Spike! What have you done with my book?! [growls]\nSpike: Why would I do anything with your book? We're friends! It... it was probably the owl!\nOwlowiscious: [hoots]\nRarity: But, wait... I don't seem to need it anymore, do I? Yes... yes...! I can feel its magic flowing within me now! I'm so excited! I'm so excited!\nSpike: [quietly] I'm so scared.\nRarity: Oh, the places we'll go, Spike! Manehattan, Fillydelphia, Canterlot! And there you'll be by my side, just as you've always been here in Ponyville, your constant praise and adoration driving me to even greater heights, until there isn't an inch of Equestria that hasn't been utterly transformed by my creative genius!\nSpike: ...No.\nRarity: What did you say?\nSpike: I said 'no'. You've been changing things, but you haven't been making them better. I should have told you the truth at the very beginning, but I didn't because I was trying to be a supportive friend. [sighs] But instead, I let you become something awful.\nRarity: Awful?\n[magic whirling]\nRarity: Ugh... what happened?\nSpike: Rarity! You're okay?\nRarity: I... I think so... though by the looks of it, something quite terrifying has happened to Ponyville.\nSpike: You happened.\nRarity: Me?\nSpike: The last part of the spell!\nRarity: [flashback] Only when true words are spoken will you finally be set free.\nSpike: The spell took over you, and you wanted to change everything in Equestria. I was afraid to tell you how I really felt about it, but then I... I told you the truth.\nRarity: Dearest Spike, you should never be afraid to tell me the truth. We're friends, remember?\n\nSpike: Today I learned how important it is to be honest with your friends when they're doing something that you don't think is right. A true friend knows that you're speaking up because you care about them.\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike. Never, ever, ever, ever take another book out of the library at the castle without asking! Princess Cadance and Princess Luna have much better things to do than help me clean up Ponyville! Do you have any idea how hard it was to reverse that much dark magic?!\nSpike: [chuckles] You don't look so good.\nTwilight Sparkle: [growls]\nSpike: What? I'm just being honest! It's what good friends do!\nTwilight Sparkle: [growls]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nRainbow Dash: This just got real!\n[ponies chattering]\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: [cheering]\n[creaking]\nRainbow Dash: Listen up, gang! We're almost there, so I've got a few things to say. First off, who here besides me thinks this is the best Equestria Games delegation in Ponyville history?\n[ponies cheering]\nBulk Biceps: Yeah!\nRainbow Dash: And no matter what your sport is, we gotta give it our best, because we've all got a genuine shot at Ponyville gold!\n[ponies cheering]\nRainbow Dash: ...With the possible exception of Bulk Biceps, Fluttershy, and me. I mean, we're good and all, but we're up against the Wonderbolts in the aerial relay, so gold's kind of a stretch. Let's not kid ourselves.\nScootaloo: Don't feel bad, Rainbow Dash! We have absolutely no shot at getting gold either!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, that's because you're carrying the flag for Ponyville in the opening ceremony. There are no winners.\nScootaloo: Winners or not, we still have the chance to be awesome!\nRainbow Dash: That's the spirit! You hear that, everypony? Winners or not, we all still have the chance to be awesome!\n[ponies cheering]\nRainbow Dash: But, uh, let's still try to win lots and lots of stuff too, 'kay?\n\n[theme song]\n\n[steam hissing]\n[bell ringing]\nSpike: [straining] It's all in there, gang! Leave it to Spike, champion gear-carrier for all your gear-carrying needs.\nApple Bloom: And the Ponyville flag? You sure? And what about the flagpole?\nSpike: In with the portable ramp! Whoa!\n[thud]\nScootaloo: Give it a rest, Apple Bloom.\nSpike: Aw, she's just nervous, that's all. Perfectly understandable. Whenever I'm afraid I'll forget something or start to panic, I have a simple trick. I count to ten, and by the time I'm done, I've calmed myself enough to get the job done right every time. Easy-peasy, cider-squeezy!\n[hooves rumbling]\nSpike: Hey! Put me down!\nScootaloo: What's going on?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike! Are you all right?\nCrystal Guard: A thousand pardons, O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious.\nSpike: Huh? Who the what now?\nPrincess Cadance: [to guards] Thanks for bringing Spike to us. [to Spike] It's okay, Spike. We'll have our hoofponies go back for your bags.\nSpike: Uh, can they hang back a second and tell me what's going on first?\n\nSpike: [eating] Mm! So the ponies here think I'm some kind of hero, huh? [to Fleur De Verre] More of the green ones, please? I like the green ones.\nTwilight Sparkle: Last time you were here, you got the Crystal Heart to Princess Cadance in time to save this entire empire from destruction!\nPrincess Cadance: You are known throughout my empire as \"Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious\".\nTwilight Sparkle: Isn't that awesome? You're a big shot here, Spike! See that? That's you!\nSpike: [a la Barbra Streisand] Hello, gawgeous!\nPrincess Cadance: This is why we all hope you do us the honor of lighting the torch at the opening ceremony. You'd be the very first dragon in the history of the Equestria Games to do so.\nSpike: Of course I'll do it! And \u2013 bonus \u2013 I can do it with my fire breath! [breathes fire] [laughs nervously]\n\n[crowd cheering]\nShining Armor: Places for the procession, everypony! Two minutes!\nPinkie Pie: [laughing]\n\nMs. Harshwhinny: And you're quite certain you also understand exactly what you're supposed to do?\nSpike: I stand where you tell me until you give me the signal, and then I walk over and light the torch.\nMs. Harshwhinny: Mm. Couldn't be simpler.\n[crowd cheering]\nSpike: [gasps]\nMs. Harshwhinny: Mr. the Dragon, are you coming? [to herself] Honestly. [out loud] Would somepony help him walk?\nShining Armor: Now, please welcome the delegation from Ponyville!\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: Ponyville forever! Yay!\nRainbow Dash: Awesome!\nFluttershy: Yay.\nBulk Biceps: Yeah!\nApplejack, Pinkie Pie and Rarity: [cheering]\nTwilight Sparkle: [cheering]\nMs. Harshwhinny: [stomps hoof] This is the signal! [stomps hoof] I'm giving you the signal now! Mr. the Dragon!\nSpike: [inhales] [coughing] Come on, Spike! Calm yourself! Count to ten. One... two... three... thousand... fourteen thousand... Twenty thousand...! Thirty thousand...!\nPrincess Cadance: What's wrong?\nSpike: [inhales] [weak breath] Tell me this isn't happening...\nTwilight Sparkle: Equestria, we have a problem.\n\nSpike: [inhales] [coughing]\nMs. Harshwhinny: Mr. the Dragon! Would you light the torch already?!\nSpike: I don't know what it is, but I just don't have the stuff today! Did you bring a match?\nMs. Harshwhinny: You're a fire-breathing dragon.\nSpike: [coughs] [raspy] Then some cough drops, maybe?\nMs. Harshwhinny: [growls]\nSpike: Nevermind. I'll keep trying. [exhales]\nPrincess Cadance: Somepony go down and help him!\nSpike: [clicking] Light! Light! [straining]\n[flames whooshing]\n[crowd cheering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Phew!\nMs. Harshwhinny: Oh! How did you do that?\nSpike: I'm... not sure.\nMs. Harshwhinny: Oh, well. Better late than never.\nShining Armor: Let the games begin!\n[crowd cheering]\n\nRarity: Oh! There are our little superstars! You were fabulous!\nApplejack: Made me sit up proud like a cornstalk in August!\nRainbow Dash: Ya done good, squirt!\nTwilight Sparkle: You three really were wonderful. But does anypony know what was going on with Spike?\nApplejack: He sure seemed to be having a tough time of it out there.\nRarity: He put things right in time, though.\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, it was me. I didn't want him to be embarrassed, so I cast a secret spell to light it for him.\nRarity: Oh, dear. Have you told him?\nTwilight Sparkle: No, but he might have figured it out on his own.\nApplejack: You gotta tell him, just in case.\nTwilight Sparkle: I know. I'm just afraid of how he'll take it. I know what pride he takes in a job well done.\nRainbow Dash: Psst, here he comes now! Act casual! [to Spike] 'Sup?\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike! Is everything okay?\nSpike: I guess. I don't know. The weirdest thing happened down there.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah, about that. I\u2013\nSpike: I mean, there I was, trying to light the torch, with all of Equestria watching, and feeling like the hugest failure ever, and then the thing just lit! It was amazing!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, phew! I was afraid you'd be upset.\nSpike: Upset? Are you kidding? Why would I be upset to discover I can light fire... with my mind?\nApplejack, Rainbow Dash, Rarity and Twilight Sparkle: What?!\nBright Smile: Look, look, it's the Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious!\nElbow Grease: Can we get your autograph?\nSpike: Sure!\n[scribbling]\nBright Smile: How you saved our Empire last time you were here was really amazing!\nSpike: Aw. You know what else is amazing? Watch this! [beat] [straining] Don't worry. Once it bursts into flames through brainpower, I'll sign another one for ya. Promise. [straining]\nTwilight Sparkle: [whispering] Spike, may I have a word with you a moment?\nSpike: Hey, you'd better be careful with that! It might burst into flames later! Delayed reaction. Hey, Twi, what is it? Hold on, hold on, give me a second... If I can set fire to stuff with my mind, mind-reading must be just around the corner! And I predict that you are about to ask me... to set fire to something with my mind!\nTwilight Sparkle: No, because you can't!\nSpike: Oh, really? So how do you explain what happened down there in front of thousands and thousands of\u2013\nTwilight Sparkle: I did it, Spike. I cast a spell to do it for you.\nSpike: In front of... thousands and... thousands...?\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sorry, Spike. I just couldn't stand to see you stuck like that! You understand, don't you?\nSpike: I... I... I need to be alone right now.\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike?\n\"Neighls Bohr\": O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious, can I get your autograph?\nSpike: Sorry. You should probably ask somebody special instead.\n\n[crowd cheering]\nShining Armor: Our next event... [amplified, some distance away] ...the aerial relay!\nApplejack: That's Dash and Fluttershy!\nPinkie Pie: Oh, no! We can't be late for that!\nSecurity Guard: Miss? Step right over here. Unicorns will no longer be admitted without a disabling spell, to prevent cheating. And make sure you don't even try casting a spell, or we'll know it.\nRarity: Hmph!\n\nPinkie Pie: [chewing] [swallows] If Ponyville medals here, we'll have eight medals so far, putting us tied for the lead with Cloudsdale! Unless Cloudsdale medals here too...!\nSpike: Ms. Harshwhinny? I know you're really busy, but...\nMs. Harshwhinny: What is it?\nSpike: Maybe there's something else I can do for the Games. Y'know, something really worthy of the Crystal Empire's admiration?\nMs. Harshwhinny: What are you talking about? You lit the torch for the whole thing!\nSpike: Uh, well, actually, that wasn't really\u2013\nMs. Harshwhinny: That wasn't worthy enough for you? Ugh, for pony's sake! Next thing you know, you'll be asking to put on a rock concert.

And now, the anthem of\u2013\nSpike: And I shall do the honor of singing!\n[crowd cheers]\nShining Armor: [to Spike, hushed] Spike, what are you doing?!\nSpike: You know how they always just play the music? [amplified] Well, I know all the words to our anthem, and will sing them for you now, loud and proud, to the enjoyment of all!\n[crowd cheers]\nShining Armor: And now... um... the Cloudsdale anthem, as sung by... Spike!\nSpike: Wait! The Cloudsdale anthem?\nShining Armor: [hushed] They only play the anthem for the winner, Spike! The Wonderbolts are from Cloudsdale!\nSpike: But... But I don't know the words to the Cloudsdale anthem! I've never even heard it!\nCrystal Pony in Crowd: Sing for us, O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious!\nSpike: [clears throat] [singing out of time and rhythm]\nOh, we're the Wonderbolts and we're super fast\nAnd we're from Cloudsdale which-is-a-part-of-Equestria\u00a0 [laughs nervously]\nThat we like best and we're proud and we're fast and we like it because it really has nice trees\nYeah, we love the town because it's so cool and, and we like to fly really fast and everything like that\n[sighs] I kinda wish this was over 'cause it is... n't... yet... over... now.\n\nOh, we're the Wonderbolts and we're super fast\nAnd we're from Cloudsdale which-is-a-part-of-Equestria\u00a0 [laughs nervously]\nThat we like best and we're proud and we're fast and we like it because it really has nice trees\nYeah, we love the town because it's so cool and, and we like to fly really fast and everything like that\n[sighs] I kinda wish this was over 'cause it is... n't... yet... over... now.\n\nOh, we're the Wonderbolts and we're super fast and we're cloud\u2013 from Cloudsdale\nWe like it there 'cause it's really nice and the trees are cool and I hope it is over now\nAnd... it keeps going on, la la la\nAnd we really love the town\nSo I wish that this... song... was over now.\nOver... now.\nOver... now.\n[silence from crowd]\n[baby crying]\nPinkie Pie: Nailed it!\n\nOh, we're the Wonderbolts and we're super fast and we're cloud\u2013 from Cloudsdale\nWe like it there 'cause it's really nice and the trees are cool and I hope it is over now\nAnd... it keeps going on, la la la\nAnd we really love the town\nSo I wish that this... song... was over now.\nOver... now.\nOver... now.\n\nApple Bloom: Spike, you comin'?\nSpike: Nah, I got this stuff to pack up.\nScootaloo: But you've been moping in here for almost the entire Games.\nSweetie Belle: And tonight's the closing ceremony!\nSpike: Which means we leave tomorrow. Ergo, the packing.\n\n[crowd cheering]\nShining Armor: And so the Games conclude as they always do, with the ice archery finals! Ice archers, take your places!\n[crowd cheering]\nApplejack: Too bad Ponyville doesn't have any ice archers competin'. We don't have anyone to root for.\nPinkie Pie: That's okay. Ponyville has thirty seven medals, and Cloudsdale thirty six, so looks like we'll be medal champs of the Games anyway! Woo-hoo!\nRainbow Dash: But Cloudsdale has two ice archery finalists down there now! If they both place, Cloudsale wins the medal count!\nPinkie Pie: So you're saying that it all comes down to this one event?!\nApplejack: Pretty much.\nPinkie Pie: Omigoshomigoshomigoshomigosh! Twilight! Come take this extra seat next to me and freak out over the medal count! I'll show you how: Omigoshomigoshomigoshomigosh!\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, I was looking for Spike. Have you seen him?\nApple Bloom: He wouldn't come.\nSweetie Belle: We tried to talk him into it...\nScootaloo: ...but he wouldn't listen!\nPinkie Pie: You can have his extra seat, though. Uh... Twi?\n\nSpike: [exhales]\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike?\nSpike: [gasps]\nTwilight Sparkle: You here?\nSpike: [chokes] Uh, yeah! I'm super-busy! Look at all this packing left to do, heh. Crazy, right?\nTwilight Sparkle: No more hiding out. You're coming with me. Now.\nSpike: Okay, fine. I'll come. Can I at least wear these?\n\n[arrows being fired]\nRainbow Dash: Those aren't your average arrows. They freeze whatever part of the target they hit. Whoever encases their entire target in ice first wins. Keep your eye on number seven from Cloudsdale \u2013 he's the favorite.\nTwilight Sparkle: Honestly, Spike, I don't see why you're being so hard on yourself.\nSpike: I let everypony down. Twice. You never let anypony down, so you don't have any idea what that's like.\nTwilight Sparkle: Are you kidding? I've totally let ponies down. That's not the point. The torch got lit, the aerial relay teams got their medals \u2013 no harm, no foul.\nSpike: Can we at least watch from inside there? I'm not sure I'm ready to face crowds in the stands just yet.\n[arrows being fired]\n[ice crackling]\n[crowd gasping, screaming]\nShining Armor: No!\nPrincess Celestia and Princess Luna: [gasps]\nRainbow Dash: Steer it towards the field, away from the crowds!\nShining Armor: Somepony cut the disabling spell!\nSecurity Guard 2: There isn't time!\nSpike: Dash, Fluttershy! Move!\n[fire whooshing]\n[steam hissing]\n[rain pouring]\n[crowd cheering]\n\nRainbow Dash: That was awesome!\nRest of main cast: [various exclamations of praise]\nPrincess Cadance: I just wanted to thank you personally for saving those ponies and the Games, O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious. You must be very proud.\nSpike: I guess.\nAll present characters bar Spike: You guess?!\nSpike: I just saw what needed to be done and reacted. Just so happens I can breathe fire and... if any of you could do that, you'd have done the same.\nApplejack: Forgive me for bein' blunt, Spike, but you're not makin' a lick of sense.\nSpike: Well, it's just how I feel.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait a second. I think I get it. You keep saying you let everypony down, but we all keep saying you didn't. You know who's disappointed in you, Spike? You. And only you can make it right with you again. What would that take, Spike?\nSpike: Meh, I don't know. Can you turn back time? 'Cause I'd sure like a do-over on that opening ceremony.\nPrincess Cadance: We can't turn back time, but, would you do me the great honor of lighting fireworks in my place at the closing ceremonies tonight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on, Spike. You saved the Crystal Empire twice! I think you can light some fireworks.\nSpike: Mm, I guess I have to at least give it a shot.\nMain cast: [cheering]\n\n[crowd cheering]\nPinkie Pie: We did it! Ponyville won the medal count, and only by one medal!\nRainbow Dash: Hmm, wonder which medal that was? Bam!\nApplejack: How does it feel to have opened the best Equestria Games in Ponyville history, squirt?\nApple Bloom: Probably as good as it feels to close them!\n[guards marching]\nMs. Harshwhinny: Okay, it's time!\nSpike: You know, it's kinda weird. No matter how many times others tell you you're great, all the praise in the world means nothing if you don't feel it inside.

I pretty much just have to smile and wave as the dignitaries arrive.\nRarity: Yes, but you get to smile and wave like a princess.\nApplejack: How exactly is that different than smilin' and wavin' like not a princess?\nTwilight Sparkle: It isn't.\nFluttershy: What's wrong, Twilight?\nPinkie Pie: Why the looooooooong face?\nTwilight Sparkle: I've just been feeling a little unsure about things lately. It doesn't seem that my new role as a princess equates to all that much.\nApplejack: That's just silly. You've got a real important role in Equestria.\nFluttershy: Princess Celestia wouldn't have asked you to come today if she didn't think so.\nTwilight Sparkle: I guess you're right.\nRarity: Of course we are. Now hurry along!

Couldn't one of the royal guard have unfurled the banner?\nPrincess Celestia: Having all four of us in the Empire to greet them lets the dignitaries know that their visit is considered an important one.\nPrincess Cadance: Plus, it gives me an opportunity to see my favorite sister-in-law.\nTwilight Sparkle: And I'm happy to see you. All of you.\nPrincess Cadance: But...?\nTwilight Sparkle: But I... well, it's just that Princess Luna raises the moon, Princess Celestia raises the sun, you protect the Crystal Empire, and all I seem to do is... smile and wave.\n\n[Twilight Sparkle]\nIt isn't that I'm ungrateful\nFor all the things that I've earned,\nFor all the journeys I have taken,\nAll the lessons that I have learned\n\nIt isn't that I'm ungrateful\nFor all the things that I've earned,\nFor all the journeys I have taken,\nAll the lessons that I have learned\n\nBut I wonder where I'm going now,\nWhat my role is meant to be\nI don't know how to travel\nTo a future that I can't see\n\nBut I wonder where I'm going now,\nWhat my role is meant to be\nI don't know how to travel\nTo a future that I can't see\n\nI have my wings, I wear this crown\nI'm a princess, this is true\nBut it's still unclear to me\nJust what I am meant to do\n\nI have my wings, I wear this crown\nI'm a princess, this is true\nBut it's still unclear to me\nJust what I am meant to do\n\nI wanna\u00a0have a purpose\nWanna do all that I can\nI wanna make a contribution\nI want to be a part of the plan\n\nI wanna\u00a0have a purpose\nWanna do all that I can\nI wanna make a contribution\nI want to be a part of the plan\n\n[Princess Celestia]\nYour destiny's uncertain\nAnd that's sometimes hard to take\nBut it will become much clearer\nWith every new choice you make\n\nYour destiny's uncertain\nAnd that's sometimes hard to take\nBut it will become much clearer\nWith every new choice you make\n\n[Princess Luna]\nPatience is never easy\nI understand wanting more\nI know how hard it is to wait\nTo spread out your wings and soar\n\nPatience is never easy\nI understand wanting more\nI know how hard it is to wait\nTo spread out your wings and soar\n\n[Princess Cadance]\nBut you stand here for a reason\nYou're gifted and you are strong\nThat crown is upon your head because\nYou belong\n\nBut you stand here for a reason\nYou're gifted and you are strong\nThat crown is upon your head because\nYou belong\n\n[Princesses Celestia, Luna, and Cadance]\nKnow that your time is coming soon\nAs the sun rises, so does the moon\nAs love finds a place in every heart\nYou are a princess; you'll play your part\n\nKnow that your time is coming soon\nAs the sun rises, so does the moon\nAs love finds a place in every heart\nYou are a princess; you'll play your part\n\n[Princess Luna]\nWe understand you wanting more\nA chance to shine, a chance to soar\n\nWe understand you wanting more\nA chance to shine, a chance to soar\n\n[Princess Cadance]\nSoon will come the day it turns around\n\nSoon will come the day it turns around\n\n[Princesses Celestia, Luna, and Cadance]\nKnow that your time is coming soon\nAs the sun rises, so does the moon\nAs love finds a place in every heart\nYou are a princess; you'll play your part\n\nKnow that your time is coming soon\nAs the sun rises, so does the moon\nAs love finds a place in every heart\nYou are a princess; you'll play your part\n\n[Princess Celestia]\nYou are a princess; you'll play your part\nPrincess Celestia: Your time will come.\n\nYou are a princess; you'll play your part\n\n[can clanking]\nLord Tirek: [heavy breathing]\nRare Find: Very sorry.

But Scorpan soon came to appreciate the ways of Equestria, even befriending a young unicorn wizard.\nPrincess Luna: [narrating] Scorpan urged his brother to abandon their plans. When Tirek refused, Scorpan alerted us to Tirek's intentions.\nPrincess Celestia: [narrating] Scorpan returned to his own land, and Tirek was sent to Tartarus for his crimes. But it appears he has found a way to escape.\nPrincess Luna: We believe it happened when Cerberus left his post at the gates.\nTwilight Sparkle: But that was a long time ago. Why is he just now starting to steal magic?\nPrincess Celestia: His time in Tartarus left him very weak. He has just now gained enough strength to use his dark powers.\nPrincess Luna: But with each passing moment, he grows stronger still.\nPrincess Cadance: And I know just the princess who can stop him.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes. I'll find him and\u2013\nPrincess Celestia: No, Twilight. I'm afraid I must call in another to stop Tirek. Discord.\nTwilight Sparkle, Princess Luna, Princess Cadance: [gasps]\n\nApplejack: ...As in Discord Discord?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes!\nFluttershy: I don't think it's that big of a surprise. He can be very helpful.\n[beat]\nTwilight Sparkle: He can sense when there's a magical imbalance. The next time Tirek steals magic, Discord will be able to track him down!\nRainbow Dash: So what are you supposed to do in the meantime?\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Nothing. Unless of course one of you needs me to smile and wave.\nSpike: Where are you going?\nTwilight Sparkle: To the Castle of the Two Sisters. I'm not really needed anywhere else. Might as well catch up on some of my reading.\nRainbow Dash: You want some company?\nApplejack:\u00a0It has been a while since we visited the castle. Might be fun!\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe I could use a little company right now.\n\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] I still can't believe we had to give back the Elements.\nRarity: It had to be done or the Tree of Harmony wouldn't have survived.\nFluttershy: But Twilight was right. Even without the Elements, our friendship is as strong as ever.\nApplejack: I just hope another 'friend' of ours never makes us sorry we had to give them up.\nDiscord: [laughs] Oh, you're talking about me, I presume?\nApplejack: How'd you guess?\nDiscord: My ears were burning.\n[splash]\nRainbow Dash: What are you even doing here, Discord?\nDiscord: Oh, just a bit of light reading before I head off on my extremely important mission. I suppose you all know that I've been tasked to capture a certain escapee.\nSpike: Big deal.\nDiscord: You're right, Spike. It is a big deal. Seems I possess a magic that gives me quite an important role in Equestria. Maybe they should make me an Alicorn princess.\n[cheering offscreen]\nDiscord: Mmwah! Mmwah!\nRainbow Dash: In your dreams!\n[bonk]\nDiscord: Oh, I never dream of such things. Ask Princess Luna.\nApplejack: Don't you have a creepy magic-stealin' villain to track down?\nDiscord: Yes, yes, yes, of course. It's just that I couldn't help but notice that Twilight hasn't yet opened this little chest of hers. I-I-It got me thinking, what if what's locked inside is something that could help her prove her royal worth? I only bring it up because she said that she's been feeling like her role as a princess doesn't equate to much.\nPinkie Pie: Wait a minute! How do you know how she was feeling?!\nDiscord: [mock sadness] Oh, my. Is eavesdropping not the way you're supposed to find out what your best pals are up to? Woe is me. Will I ever learn the intricate nuances of being a good friend?\n[beat]\nDiscord: [clears throat] Well in any case, I suppose now is as good a time as any for me to make my exit.\n[engine starts]\nApplejack: And good riddance!\nDiscord: Oopsie-doopsie, I almost left with the little journal you've all been keeping. What a fascinating read. Haven't you girls just learned so much? I've bookmarked a few of the more interesting passages. You really should take a look! [to Fluttershy, hushed] We're still on for tea later, aren't we, Fluttershy?\nFluttershy: I wouldn't miss it.\nDiscord: [singsong] Well, I'll bring the cucumber sandwiches...!\n[door shuts]\nApplejack: Sometimes I think the 'reformed' Discord is more obnoxious than the 'before-he-was-reformed' Discord.\nRarity: Indeed.\nFluttershy: But he could be right, couldn't he? What if there is something important in that chest?\nTwilight Sparkle: There's only one way to find out.\n\n[pages turning]\nTwilight Sparkle: Anything?\nRest of main cast: [various 'no's]\nTwilight Sparkle: There must be something in this library that can help me figure out how to open it. The answer's in one of these books. I just know it.\n[pages turning]\n\n[thump]\nDiscord: Tirek, I presume?\nLord Tirek: Discord. You're free?\nDiscord: As a bird.\nLord Tirek: I commend you on your escape.\nDiscord: I'm afraid the feeling isn't mutual. [snaps fingers]\n[chain clinking]\nLord Tirek: Oh, I should have known you would want to have Equestria all to yourself.\nDiscord: Oh, I'm not doing this for me. I'm doing it for my friends. [hushed] Just between the two of us, it's mostly for Fluttershy. [squee]\nLord Tirek: Fluttershy? You're not saying you're friends with ponies?\nDiscord: Surprise!\nLord Tirek: I am surprised that someone with your intellect does not see this 'friendship' is but a new form of imprisonment. Clearly you've had to abandon your true nature to stay in their good graces.\n[harp playing]\nDiscord: I have done nothing of the sort!\nLord Tirek: Oh, please, I've seen this before. But he was always weak minded. You are Discord, you are legend, you cannot fall into the same trap that claimed my brother! Help me to grow strong, and be rewarded with something far greater than friendship. Freedom. Once I've stripped these ponies of their magic, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see their world turned upside down. Who better to do so than the master of chaos himself? Join me, Discord, and reclaim your greatness. Unless, of course, 'pony errand boy' is the role you've always wanted to play in this world.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I think I found something! I've been reading our journal, and there's something interesting about the sections that Discord bookmarked. Applejack, do you remember when you had to tell everypony that the tonic Granny bought from the Flim Flam brothers didn't really work?\nApplejack: How could I forget? It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do.\n\nGranny Smith: [gulping]\nApplejack: [flashback] I hate to disappoint everypony, but there's no way Granny could have made that dive, because this tonic is a fake!\n[crowd gasps]\n\nApplejack: [present] And in that moment, I knew I had to be honest. I just knew it. But what's that got to do with openin' the chest?\nTwilight Sparkle: I've found that each of you has had to face a situation where living up to the Element of Harmony you represent wasn't easy. Fluttershy, it was when you realized that the way to show kindness to the Breezies was by forcing them to leave your home.\nFluttershy: Oh, the looks on their poor little faces! But I knew that, as difficult as it was, pushing them away was the kindest thing I could do.\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity, even after Suri took advantage of your generosity at Fashion Week in Manehattan, you didn't let it cause you to abandon your generous spirit.\nRarity: I simply couldn't have lived with myself if I didn't do something special for the friends who have always been so generous to me!\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash, you had the chance to fly with the Wonderbolts at the Equestria Games, but instead you chose to compete with your friends.\nRainbow Dash: Sure! But being loyal to my friends was way\u2013\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, my turn, my turn!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, you realized that seeing your friend laugh was more important than proving you were a better party planner than Cheese Sandwich.\nRainbow Dash: Best party I've ever had.\nRarity: It's clear we've all had our moments to shine, Twilight, but I'm with Applejack. What does any of this have to do with the opening of the chest?\nTwilight Sparkle: All of you had tough choices to make. But when you made the right one and embraced your element, it helped somepony else make the right choice too. Each of you received something from the pony whose life you helped change. I know it sounds crazy, but maybe there's something special about those objects that could lead us to the location of the keys. The chest is connected to the Tree of Harmony, the Tree is connected to the Elements, and the Elements are connected to all of us. There must be a connection! I hate to admit it, but maybe Discord was trying to be a good friend after all.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't see anything on them that would give us a clue as to where the keys might be. They're just... ordinary, everyday objects.\nPinkie Pie: Come on, Boneless! Give us that key!\n[Boneless squeaking]\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't think that's going to work.\n[Boneless squeaking]\nMain cast: [gasps]\n[magic zaps]\n\n[keys clicking]\nTwilight Sparkle: There's still one key missing. The key that represents the element of magic. My element.\nFluttershy: Oh, but I'm sure that if we've gotten our keys, you have too, Twilight.\nRarity: Think, Twilight. When have you completed a difficult magical task, and in doing so encouraged another pony to do the same?\nTwilight Sparkle: I haven't. If I had, I would have written about it in the journal.\nSpike: Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure you'll get your key eventually. [sharp inhalation] [hurk]\n[magic pop]\nSpike: What's it say?\nTwilight Sparkle: That I'm needed in Canterlot at once!\n\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: I came as quickly as I could! Is something wrong? Is it Tirek?\nPrincess Celestia: I'm afraid I put too much trust in Discord and the effect that friendship would have upon him.\n[crowd gasps]\nPrincess Luna: Discord has betrayed the ponies of Equestria and joined forces with Tirek.\n[crowd gasps]\n[magic noises]\n[Discord clapping]\nTwilight Sparkle: How could he do this?! I thought our friendship meant something to him! I thought he had changed.\nPrincess Celestia: Tirek has stolen enough magic that he now has the strength to steal flight as well. Without Pegasi to control the weather, there will be no rain in Equestria. There is word he has gone after Earth ponies as well. Without their strength, they will not be able to tend the land.\nPrincess Luna: Ponies will no longer be in control of their world. That power will belong solely to Tirek.\nPrincess Celestia: There is no doubt that Tirek is after Alicorn magic. With Discord by his side, we will not be able to stop him from taking it.\nPrincess Luna: Once it is in his possession, his power will know no bounds, and all hope will be lost.\nPrincess Celestia: But there is one solution. It is only by making this sacrifice that Equestria and the lands beyond it might be saved. We must rid ourselves of our magic before Tirek has the chance to steal it from us.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\n[To be continued...]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[Previously on My Little Pony]\n\nFluttershy: What's wrong, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: It doesn't seem that my new role as a princess equates to all that much.\n\nLord Tirek: I am Lord Tirek, and I will take what should have been mine long ago.\n\nPrincess Luna: With each passing moment, he grows stronger still.\nPrincess Cadance: And I know just the princess who can stop him.\nPrincess Celestia: I'm afraid I must call in another to stop Tirek.\n\nDiscord: [laughs] Oh, you're talking about me, I presume?\n\nDiscord: Haven't you girls just learned so much?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: And there's something interesting about the sections that Discord bookmarked.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Each of you received something from the pony whose life you helped change.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: There's still one key missing.

We found all six keys, defeated Tirek, and got this sweet castle! End of story!\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, but why?\nApplejack: I dunno, sugarcube. Maybe it's just your new house and there ain't nothin' more to it than that.\nRarity: I must say, speaking strictly on aesthetics, there really doesn't need to be more to it. It's all simply divine!\nFluttershy: I agree with Twilight. And Rarity. And Applejack. And Rainbow Dash. And Pinkie Pie. Oh, and probably Spike.\nSpike: [snoring]\nTwilight Sparkle: As princess, I've been chosen to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. So why would the Tree of Harmony want us to sit in a castle in Ponyville? It doesn't make any sense.\n[rumbling]\nSpike: [groans] Is that new? I like it.\n\n[theme song]\n\nSpike: This is incredible! It's got all of Equestria!\nPinkie Pie: Hi, Mom and Dad!\n[stomp]\n[shimmering]\nPinkie Pie: [giggles]\nFluttershy: But if this is Ponyville, why are our cutie marks over there?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know. But it seems like the map wants us to find out. The Tree, the chest, this castle, and now the map. How can we not follow it?\nRainbow Dash: Y'know what? There's a ton of room for dangerous adventure along that route. Count me in!\nApplejack: Aw, shoot, I reckon you're right.\nPinkie Pie: Well, I was planning on organizing my baking sheets, but okay!\nRarity: [sighs] Very well.\n[beat]\nFluttershy: Um, maybe I'll just stay here with Spike.\nSpike: Awesome! Me and Big Mac have a huge weekend ahead of us talkin' hoofball, and... and trading hoofball cards, and arguing about hoofball stats...\nFluttershy: O-o-on second thought, m-m-maybe I'd better go with them. In case they need me.\nTwilight Sparkle: Looks like it's time for a road trip.\nSpike: Well, suit yourself. But he's got a Hock Fetlock rookie card I plan to sweet-talk right into these hot little claws.\n\n[train engine chuffing]\n[brakes squealing]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: That's it! That's the place on the map!\nRarity: Right. Let's get down there and find the spa.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait. We don't know why the map sent us here. We shouldn't just walk right in. It could be dangerous.\nRainbow Dash: Yes!\nPinkie Pie: Stay behind me, everypony! I'm on it!\nApplejack: Careful, Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie: [grunts]\n[thud, scraping noises]\nRainbow Dash: This is where the map sent us? It looks like the most boring place in Equestria.\nApplejack: It's just an ordinary village full of ordinary pony folk.\nRarity: It could certainly use a few more architectural flourishes. Or any architectural flourishes.\nFluttershy: I think it's lovely.\nPinkie Pie: I don't like it. I don't like it one bit. I know smiles. And those smiles? They're just not right.\nTwilight Sparkle: Forget the smiles. Look at the cutie marks.\nRainbow Dash: Okay, that's weird.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: An entire village with the same cutie mark? How can that be?\nRainbow Dash: I bet there's some sort of horrific monster behind it.\nTwilight Sparkle: What makes you say that?\nRainbow Dash: 'Cause fighting a horrific monster would be super-awesome!\nApplejack: I reckon we just ought to head into town and talk to some locals, find out what's goin' on.\nRainbow Dash: Great idea, AJ.

Well, all are welcome here in our little village. My name is Double Diamond, and this is Party Favor.\nApplejack: Howdy, Double Diamond. I'm Applejack, and this here's Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight Sparkle.\nDouble Diamond: And you all have your own unique cutie marks.\nTwilight Sparkle: If you don't mind, has there been any sort of... trouble here, lately?\nDouble Diamond: Trouble? Why, I don't think we've ever had trouble in our little village.\nParty Favor: It's true. You'll see. Hm.\nDouble Diamond: Perhaps you'd care to speak to our founder Starlight Glimmer.\nFluttershy: I wish everypony in Equestria was as friendly as these ponies are.\nPinkie Pie: I've got my eye on them.

We don't get many Alicorns around here.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, but \"Twilight\" is fine.\nStarlight Glimmer: So! How did you hear of our little village?\nTwilight Sparkle: It's kind of a long story. Let's just say we found it on a map.\nPinkie Pie: Technically, it's a Tree-chest-castle-map!\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, however you found us, we're happy to have you! We're happy to have anypony who wants to experience true friendship for the first time.\nApplejack: Say what?\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, indeed. That's what's so unique about our village, you see. Around here, we don't flaunt our special talents because we don't have any special talents to flaunt.\nTwilight Sparkle: Is that why you all have those cutie marks?\nStarlight Glimmer: Perhaps it would be easier to understand if I gave you a tour of the village!\n\n[marching drum cadence]\nStarlight Glimmer: Heads high, ponies!

They all seem perfectly happy with their choice.\nPinkie Pie: Don't believe their smiles, Fluttershy.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sorry, I guess we're just a little confused by all of this.\nStarlight Glimmer: We have no judgements here in our village. Each of us was confused once as well, blinded by the false promise of our cutie marks.\nRainbow Dash: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is she for real?\nTwilight Sparkle: When we were sent to this village, we assumed it was to help in some way. But, well, it doesn't seem like you need any help.\nStarlight Glimmer: Have you considered perhaps that you might have been sent here so we could help you? After all, nopony has ever come to our village and wanted to leave. Why should you be any different? But that is entirely your choice. Please enjoy our little corner of Equestria. We're all quite fond of it. No doubt you will be as well. Double Diamond, please help our guests with whatever they might need.\nDouble Diamond: Of course.\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, this will certainly provide a boost to our little community.

They may do things a bit differently than we're used to, but that's no reason to be rude.\nRainbow Dash: [hushed] No, the reason to be rude is that they all keep staring at us!\nDouble Diamond: Need something?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, no! We're good! [hushed] Fluttershy's right. If we're going to get to the bottom of why the map sent us here, we'll need the help of these ponies.\nApplejack: I think we ran off to the end of Equestria before we even knew what that map was!\nPinkie Pie: If we were at the end of Equestria, we'd be sitting on a big 'A'! [giggles] Get it?\nRarity: Oh, please, Miss Pie! This is hardly the time for jokes! We've come all this way and for what?\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] Maybe you're right. But we're here now, and it sure feels like something's wrong.\nApplejack: That and two bits'll get you a cup of cider.\nSugar Belle: Is this a bad time?\nFluttershy: We shouldn't be bickering like this in front of our new friends. Really, Applejack, you're almost as bad as Rainbow Dash!\nRainbow Dash: Don't drag me into this!\nSugar Belle: Is your friendship ending?\nPinkie Pie: Are you crazy?! We'd never let a disagreement get in the way of food!\nSugar Belle: O-kay, well, my name is Sugar Belle. What can I bring you? We have: muffins...\n[long beat]\nTwilight Sparkle: Then I guess we'll take six muffins!\nPinkie Pie: Make that twelve! What? I'm hungry!\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] Come on, girls. We've got to stick together. It doesn't matter what happened before, we're here now.\nApplejack: I guess you're right. And the sooner we figure out why, the sooner we can go home.\nSugar Belle: Forgive me for overhearing, but just a moment ago you were disagreeing, and now it sounds like you're... agreeing.\nApplejack: Uh-huh...\nSugar Belle: Well, you had such differing opinions \u2013 and cutie marks.\nRarity: We have differing opinions all the time, darling.\nSugar Belle: But you look like you're friends.\nTwilight Sparkle: We are friends. A simple disagreement wouldn't change that.\nSugar Belle: I'm sorry, I'm just having a hard time understanding. Different talents lead to different opinions, which lead to bitterness and misery. So... why aren't you bitter and...?\nPinkie Pie: [choking] Blech! Mmmm... good...\nSugar Belle: It's all right. I know I'm not a very good baker. At least, I know I'm not any better than anypony else in the village. Well, I... hope you enjoy our little village!\nPinkie Pie: [hacking]\nSugar Belle: [hushed] Come inside before you go! Meet me downstairs!\nRainbow Dash: Okay, that was weird too.\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] Let's all sit here and eat these muffins and act normal. I think we're being watched.\n[scissors snipping]\nRainbow Dash: You think?\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] No, not like that! I mean somepony here doesn't want us talking to Sugar Belle.\nDouble Diamond: [chomp]\nApplejack: I got an idea. But you gotta eat all of them muffins, Pinkie.\nPinkie Pie: Me?! Why me?!\nApplejack: [hushed] You got a stronger stomach than any of us, and that filly in there might be our best chance at findin' out what the hay is goin' on round here.\n\nPinkie Pie: [chomping, stomach gurgles]\nApplejack: [stilted] I can't believe you ate all our muffins, Pinkie Pie! We'd best go inside and get some more!\nTwilight Sparkle: Nice work, Pinkie.\n[thumps and honks]\nPinkie Pie: I've accidentally eaten cardboard tastier than that...\nTwilight Sparkle: Hello? Sugar Belle?\nSugar Belle: Thank you for coming!\nTwilight Sparkle: Why did you want us to come down here?\nSugar Belle: So nopony could see what's about to happen.\nParty Favor: Are you really the Princess of Friendship?\nNight Glider: Do you know Princess Celestia?\nSugar Belle: I love your cutie mark!\nNight Glider: How can you be friends with different cutie marks? Don't you end up hating each other?\nSugar Belle: Oh, look at this one! This one's great too! I'd love to have my special talent back even just for a day! Make something besides those disgusting muffins...\nRainbow Dash: So what's stopping you? Go get your cutie marks back.\nParty Favor: Daydreaming is one thing, but you mean actually having it put back on? That seems extreme.\nSugar Belle: I'm not sure Starlight would like that. She wants us all to be happy in our sameness.\nTwilight Sparkle: How do you take somepony's cutie mark anyway?\nNight Glider: The cutie unmarking is a beautiful experience! Starlight uses the Staff of Sameness to magically take them away and replace them with these.\nTwilight Sparkle: But nopony should keep you from your cutie mark. It represents such an essential part of who you are.\nNight Glider: Oh, we're not kept from them. They're in the vault up in the caves. We can visit them any time we like to remind us of the heartache of a life with special talents.\nTwilight Sparkle: Can we visit this cave?\n\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm delighted you're interested in our cutie mark vault. We hope someday every pony in Equestria will make a pilgrimage here to our little village to have theirs removed too, and our message of [continues under] perfectly equal friendship can finally spread across the land.\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed, over] This must be the reason we're here.\nPinkie Pie: [hushed, over] \"Pilgrimaging\"?\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] No, helping those ponies get their cutie marks back.\nFluttershy: [hushed] Oh, are you sure, Twilight? Maybe they miss them a little, but even they didn't seem all that unhappy.\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] Then why did they want to meet us in secret? And why did they ask us not to tell Starlight who told us about the vault? Something's not right.\nStarlight Glimmer: Just through here! Behold! Our cutie mark vault!\nTwilight Sparkle: I've never seen anything like it!\nStarlight Glimmer: And here is the Staff of Sameness. It was one of the great Mage Meadowbrook's nine enchanted items. We are incredibly fortunate to have it here. This is the tool that allows us to free ourselves from our marks! I'm curious \u2013 how did the subject of the vault come up?\nPinkie Pie: Oh, some ponies were telling us how much they missed their cutie marks, and\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie: Oops...\nStarlight Glimmer: [gasps] Were they? Well, it seems you inspire all sorts of free thinking, don't you?\nRarity: [laughs nervously] Well, w-we certainly didn't intend to cause any disruptions to your charming little\u2014\nStarlight Glimmer: Good.

More pleasant than fun, I guess...\nTwilight Sparkle: Something odd about that staff. I haven't studied Eastern unicorns as much as I should have, but I'm pretty sure Meadowbrook only had eight magical items, not nine. And I don't remember any of them being a staff.\nApplejack: Well, it looks like you'll have plenty of time to try to think about it.\nStarlight Glimmer: [fading up, echoing] ...Choose equality as your special talent.

Well, let's try this again tomorrow, shall we? No new friends today, I'm afraid!\nFluttershy: Wait! I'd like to lock them in.\nStarlight Glimmer: Marvelous, Fluttershy! That's the spirit! Party Favor, will you join us, please?\nParty Favor: I'm sorry, Starlight! I'm sorry, everypony! I've seen the error of my ways! I never want to look at my cutie mark again!\nStarlight Glimmer: It seems there's cause for celebration after all!\nCrowd: Hooray! [cheering]\nParty Favor: They tried to break me! They wouldn't stop talking about how different they are, and that somehow makes their friendship stronger!\nStarlight Glimmer: Such backwards thinking.\nParty Favor: But I didn't listen! I knew what they were up to, and I didn't listen!\nStarlight Glimmer: Well done, Party Favor! We welcome you back with open hooves!\nFluttershy: Um, Starlight? I think we might have one more friend joining us today.\n[crowd gasps]\nStarlight Glimmer: Is this true?\nTwilight Sparkle: I-I think so. But I just want to be sure. If I agree to leave my cutie mark in the vault, I'll really be happier?\nStarlight Glimmer: Just look around! Equality has given us more happiness than you've ever known!\nTwilight Sparkle: And you wouldn't let me just live here in the village with my old cutie mark?\nStarlight Glimmer: Out of the question. A pony with a different cutie mark in our midst would destroy our entire philosophy. We are all equal here!\n[crowd muttering]\nFluttershy: Then how do you explain this?!\n[splash]\nStarlight Glimmer: I knew you couldn't be trusted! No! Get away!\n[crowd gasps]\nStarlight Glimmer: Wha... What are you looking at?! They're the problem, not me!\nParty Favor: How could you?\nDouble Diamond: You said cutie marks were evil! You said special talents led to pain and heartache!\nStarlight Glimmer: They do! Don't you see?! Look at them!\nSugar Belle: Then why? Why did you take ours and not give up your own?\nStarlight Glimmer: I... I had to, you fools! How could I collect your cutie marks without my magic?!\nNight Glider: But the staff has all the magic we need!\nStarlight Glimmer: The staff is a piece of wood I found in the desert! It's my magic that makes all this possible! You'd all still be living your miserable lives thinking you're better than everypony else if it weren't for my magical abilities! I brought you friendship! I brought you equality! I created harmony!\nDouble Diamond: You lied to us!\nStarlight Glimmer: So what? E-Everything else I said is true! The only way to be happy is if we're all equal!\nParty Favor: Except for you.\nTwilight Sparkle: Everypony has unique talents and gifts, and when we share them with each other, that's how rea\u2014\nStarlight Glimmer: QUIET!\nSugar Belle: You can't have a cutie mark, Starlight! Either we're all equal, or none of us are!\n[door shuts]\nDouble Diamond: Come on! Let's get our cutie marks back!\nCrowd: Yeah! [shouted agreement]\nRainbow Dash: Come on! Let's go get our cutie marks!\nFluttershy: Our cutie marks aren't in the vault! They're in there with her!\n\n[pounding]\nDouble Diamond: Stand back, everypony!\n[glass cracking]\n[magical zaps]\nRarity: Even without my cutie mark, I can tell this is beautiful!\nStarlight Glimmer: They think they can come to my village and disrupt my life? Let's see how they like spending the rest of their lives without their precious cutie marks!\nApplejack: [grunting]\nRarity: [grunting]\n[whistling]\nNight Glider: Stand back, everypony!\n[crunch]\n[glass breaks]\n[door opens]\nFluttershy: They're gone! They were right over there!\n\nRainbow Dash: Look!\nParty Favor: [blows up balloon]\n[balloon squeaking]\nParty Favor: She's headed for the pass! If she makes it into those mountains, we'll never find her!\nPinkie Pie: These are amazing!\nSugar Belle: There's a whole network of caves up there! Your cutie marks will be gone forever!\nApplejack: Then let's get moving, y'all!\n[pulsing noise]\nRainbow Dash: Oh, come on!\n\n[jars rattling]\nStarlight Glimmer: Are you all so willing to give up everything because of these strangers?!\n[snow thudding]\nSugar Belle: We gave up everything for you, because we thought you were our friend!\n\nRainbow Dash: I can't believe we have to count on these other ponies to save our cutie marks!\nTwilight Sparkle: If we hadn't come here to help them, they'd still be living under her rules! Now it's their turn to help us!\nFluttershy: And I know they can do it!\n\nSugar Belle: My newest recipe \u2013 snow pie!\n[thud]\n[explosion]\n[balloon squeaking]\n[balloons stretching]\nRainbow Dash: She's gonna get away!\nDouble Diamond: Whoa! These are my old skis! This is where I first met Starlight!\nNight Glider: Maybe you can reminisce another time! She's almost to the caves!\nDouble Diamond: Feel like an air drop?\n[skiing noises]\n[snow thudding]\n[glass breaking]\n[magical zaps]\nApplejack: Yee-haw! Finally, I can buck like a five-bit snake herder in an Appleloosa ranch house again!\nFluttershy: And you got your countryisms back, too!\n[magic zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Wh\u2013 I studied that spell for years! How can you\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: I studied magic for years too! But what I didn't know then was that studying could only take me so far. Each of my friends has taught me something different about myself! It was their unique gifts and passions and personalities that helped bring out the magic inside of me! I never would have learned that I represent the element of magic without these five! And I certainly wouldn't be here to stop you now!\nStarlight Glimmer: Spare me your sentimental nonsense! I gave these ponies real friendships they never could've had otherwise!\nDouble Diamond: How do you know that?! You never even gave us a chance!\n[magic zap]\nRainbow Dash: She's getting away!\nDouble Diamond: We'll never find her in there!\nTwilight Sparkle: We just have to hope that when she's had a chance to think it over, she realizes that you all have taught her something.\nParty Favor: It's you who have taught us something. We all came to this village because we were searching for something missing from our lives. We thought Starlight had given it to us, but now... now it seems it was in front of us all along. It's us!\nTwilight Sparkle: Does that mean you'll stay in the village?\nNight Glider: It's our home. I'm not going anywhere.\nDouble Diamond: This is a chance for all of us to get to know each other again for the very first time!\nSugar Belle: And I finally have a chance to bake something besides terrible muffins!\nAll: [laughing]\n\n[ponies laughing and chattering]\n[Wilhelm scream]\nPinkie Pie: Now those are real smiles.\n[cutie marks pulsing]\nApplejack: I'll never get used to that.\nRarity: I think it's divine.\nFluttershy: Does that mean that the map is calling us somewhere else?\nTwilight Sparkle: I have a feeling it means our work here is done.\nApplejack: Looks like you were right, Twilight. The map did have a reason for sendin' us here. We brought real friendship to these here ponies. Guess that's why you're the Princess of Friendship.\nTwilight Sparkle: But the map didn't send me. It sent us. You're a part of me, all of you. And there's no doubt you're a part of my mission to spread friendship too.\nMain cast: [laughing]\nPinkie Pie: This feels like an ending! It doesn't have to be an ending yet, right? 'Cause that Sugar Belle can bake!\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe we can stay a little while longer.

Thanks for helping me get them so fresh and clean, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: No problem, happy to do it!\nFluttershy: You probably can't wait to get back to your castle and take your own bath, huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: Aren't there more animals that need cleaning?\nFluttershy: I think you and I are the only ones left, and I can't wait to get the mud out of my mane.\n[thud, splash]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, no! Angel got dirty! I'd better stay longer to help give him a bath too!\n[splash, scrubbing noises]\n\n[theme song]\n\nFluttershy: Thank you ever so much for staying to give Angel a bath too, but, um... I think he's dry.\n[floof]\nFluttershy: Goodness! It's gotten late! You really didn't have to stay all day. Not that we don't appreciate it. Isn't that right?\nAngel: [grunts]\nFluttershy: I for one am exhausted. [yawns] Plus, I really need to rest up for that big pancake breakfast tomorrow. [beat] And I'm sure you have to get the castle ready.\nTwilight Sparkle: No! The castle's... fine!

It was like she never wanted to\u2014\nFluttershy: Leave?\nPinkie Pie: Exactly! [chomp] Eventually we ran out of time so we just went with every-berry-any-chip-surprise! [to Rarity, hushed] The surprise is I lost a measuring spoon in the batter. Somepony's gonna get a very special pancake!\nRainbow Dash: Up all night, huh? Is that why she's so, uh... out of it?\nTwilight Sparkle: [snoring]\nFluttershy: Um, I don't mean to sound unappreciative, but has anypony else noticed that Twilight has been a little too helpful lately?\nApplejack: Now that you mention it, she was lendin' a hoof at Sweet Apple Acres the other day and stuck around 'til near midnight. Dug up fifty tree-plantin' holes when all I needed was ten.\nRarity: She spent an entire afternoon rearranging a single gem drawer at the boutique. An entire afternoon!\nRainbow Dash: You think that's weird? She raced me, like, a hundred times the other day. And lost every time! She just kept goin'! Best out of ten, best out of twenty, best out of a hundred! I mean, I know hanging out with me is awesome, but it was like she'd rather keep losing than\u2014\nFluttershy: Leave?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah. Who does that?\nTwilight Sparkle: [snoring]\n[splat]\nApplejack: Somepony who's avoidin' somethin', that's who. Soon as she wakes up, we're gonna find out what.\nPinkie Pie: [coughs] I win!\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh?! I'm pancake! I mean, awake...\nApplejack: Uh, Twilight? Is there somethin' you wanna tell us?\nRarity: You know how much we appreciate all you do for us, and we simply adore having you around... but... we worry you might be... ahem... avoiding something else?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, has it been that obvious? I've been... the thing is... I know it's silly, but I... I've been avoiding... this place.\nRarity: [gasps] Why in Equestria would you want to avoid such a gorgeous castle?\nPinkie Pie: Yeah, this place has everything! Big tall ceilings that make you feel tiny! Shiny new floors that are cold to the touch! Brrr! And it even has loooong empty hallways!\n[\"hallways\" echoes out]\nPinkie Pie: Okay, I get it.\nTwilight Sparkle: The castle is amazing. But it just... [sighs] It doesn't feel like home.\nRarity: [chuckling] Oh, is that all? Why, you simply need to decorate, darling. Make this space your own!\nTwilight Sparkle: It's just so daunting! Look how big it is! I-I don't even know where to start!\nRarity: You can start by letting us do it for you. We will make this the castle of your dreams while you go to the Ponyville spa for some much needed rest and relaxation. I'm saying this with love, but... have you looked in a mirror lately? I've never seen you look this... mmmm...\nFluttershy: Frazzled?\nRarity: Yes! That is absolutely the word I was going to use.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ooh, I guess I do need a little help. And so does my castle. And I just know you'll do a great job, because nopony knows me better than you.\nApplejack: We'll make this place feel cozier than hot cider on a rainy day.\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] There's gonna be cider?!

Anything but that!\nRainbow Dash: How about these?\nRarity: Oh, but those brighten up the whole room! They're my favorite accent!\nRainbow Dash: Then let's lose the curtains! The room wouldn't need brightening if they weren't making it so dark!\nRarity: Not them! They're my favorite too!\nRainbow Dash: [growls] They can't all be your favorite! Okay, I'm taking down the portrait. We all know what we look like.\nRarity: [huffs] Well, the room still looks a little bit cluttered, doesn't it? Perhaps I'll take down a poster or two. Only to be helpful, of course!\nApplejack: Okay, everypony calm down.

I mean... how... nice is this day? I was hoping we could take the scenic way back.\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know.\nSpike: Come on. Walking is good for post-massage circulation.\nTwilight Sparkle: Really? I've never heard that theory.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] I really miss this place, Spike. We had so many wonderful memories here.\nSpike: We did, didn't we...?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Spike, I'm so sorry. Of course losing the Golden Oak Library was hard for you too. [beat] I've got an idea. Why don't we have the girls add some things to make the castle feel more like your home as well?\nSpike: Really?\nTwilight Sparkle: Hop on!\n[thud]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ow! What are you doing?\nSpike: I, um... I just thought of what I want!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, okay. What is it?\nSpike: It's a... well, I want a... it's... I kind of need a... a bed!\nTwilight Sparkle: I thought you said you sleep like a baby in the castle.\nSpike: [scoffs] Everypony knows babies are terrible sleepers. Let's go!\n\nRarity: There! Now nothing is cluttering the castle!\nRainbow Dash: You're right. There is literally nothing cluttering this castle.\nFluttershy: What do we do now?\nRarity: I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but it's almost sunset. If we don't figure this out soon, it's going to look like we didn't lift a hoof to help her!\nRainbow Dash: Why is this so hard?! We're Twilight's best friends! This should be easy for us!\nApplejack: She said it herself \u2013 if anypony should be able to make her feel comfortable in her new home, it's us. If we can't do it...\nFluttershy: Then Twilight will be stuck living in a castle that makes her feel... sad!\n[\"sad\" echoes out]\nPinkie Pie: Wow, Fluttershy! I didn't know you could be loud enough to echo!\n\nRarity: [muttering to herself] Can't believe I let go of the portrait... If it had just been me... [ducks under]\nPinkie Pie: What do we do? What do we do?! If Twilight comes home now, she'll be like \"What did you guys do?\" And we'll have to be like \"Nothing!\" And then she'll be like \"I was counting on you! Some friends you are!\" And we'll be like... [screams] [mocks crying]\nApplejack: Calm down, Pinkie. We just need to figure out what we did wrong so we can make it right.\nRarity: Well, I didn't do anything wrong! I did exactly what I would do if this were my home!\nRainbow Dash: But it's not your home. It's Twilight's home!\nRarity: Where she keeps all her Rainbow Dash trophies?\nRainbow Dash: Touch\u00e9.\nFluttershy: Maybe we're all a little guilty of making ourselves feel at home instead of Twilight.\nApplejack: Come on, y'all. We just need to think about Twilight. What was it she'd loved about livin' in the Golden Oak Library?\nFluttershy: Oh, everything! The books, the smell of books, the joy she felt from organizing books...\nRainbow Dash: Remember that time I crashed into all those books attempting my sonic rainboom after you guys just cleaned up? [laughs, sighs] That was good times.\nApplejack: Yeah, for you, maybe.\nRarity: Oh, and Applejack, remember when we were stuck having a sleepover there? That turned out to be so much fun!\nPinkie Pie: Remember the time it got blown up to smithereens?! Wait, no, that was the worst.\nApplejack: We had a lot of good memories there, though. That's what made the Golden Oak Library home.\nRest of main cast sans Twilight: Yeah...\nApplejack: [gasps] That's it!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: How's that one? Too soft? Too hard? Too lumpy?\nSpike: Um... Just right! I'll take it!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, thank goodness. I thought you'd never find one you liked! Let's find a salespony and get out of here.\nSpike: Sounds good to meee\u2014I... nn, um, uh, heh... did you hear that? [mimes squeaky springs] Too squeaky! Better keep looking!\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\n\nApplejack: [sighs] Maybe my plan won't work after all.\nRarity: Of course it will, darling. I can see it! You and Fluttershy stay here. Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie, you come with me. We're going shopping! We'll meet back at the castle.\n\n[Applejack]\nIt's not the things that ya gather 'round\n\nIt's not the things that ya gather 'round\n\n[Fluttershy]\nIt's not how much you own\n\nIt's not how much you own\n\n[Rarity]\nThe things that hold the meaning in your life\nAre the memories you've sown\n\nThe things that hold the meaning in your life\nAre the memories you've sown\n\n[All]\nSo we make, so we make, so we make\nThis castle a home\nSo we make, so we make\nThis castle a home\nSo we make, so we make\nThis castle a home!\n\nSo we make, so we make, so we make\nThis castle a home\nSo we make, so we make\nThis castle a home\nSo we make, so we make\nThis castle a home!\n\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hello?

I never want to see another dust ruffle as long as I live!\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait. Keep me from coming back here?\nRarity: [laughs nervously] It took a teensy bit longer than we thought.\nApplejack: What really makes home feel like home isn't what it looks like. It's the memories you make when you're there.\nRarity: So we've made something that celebrates the memories we've made with you since you moved to Ponyville.\n[doors open]\nFluttershy: The ornaments on the chandelier are reminders of all the fun we've had together.\nPinkie Pie: That one shows your party at the Golden Oak Library welcoming you to Ponyville!\nFluttershy: The time we shared donuts after the Grand Galloping Gala!\nRarity: We were hoping that being able to look at your beautiful old memories would inspire you to make new ones.\nApplejack: And the best part of it is, it's made from the roots of the Golden Oak Library, so you'll never forget where you came from.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's exactly what the castle needed. And I am ready to make new memories here.\nPinkie Pie: Then let's start right now with a new memory cake! Seven layer what's-that-flavor mystery surprise! These might be chocolate chips or they might be super-spicy black beans!\nTwilight Sparkle: Let's go to the dining room. It's a little sparse, but [door opens] at least there's a table and chairs. Whoa! What happened in here? Last I checked, this place was empty!\nRarity: I couldn't help myself! It was just begging for the personal touch!\nApplejack: Truth be told... I couldn't either. Your kitchen might have some rustic farm decor, Twilight.\nRainbow Dash: And there may or may not be some Daring Do posters up in your library.\nFluttershy: And some stuffed animals in your bedroom.\n[confetti cannon explodes]\nTwilight Sparkle: What was that?!\nApplejack: [sighs] One of Pinkie Pie's confetti cannons.\nPinkie Pie: What?

I'll bet she grows up to be a celebrity stylist!\nApple Bloom: But if she spends all her time cuttin' hair, who's gonna run the Manehattan CMCs?\nScootaloo: Well, not Babs. She can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if she's already got her cutie mark.\nApple Bloom: Oh, wow. I guess you're right.\nSweetie Belle: I'm glad she's happy, but I sure wouldn't want to be up to my flank in mane hair all day. Can you imagine getting stuck with a cutie mark you didn't like?\nApple Bloom: No... or at least I hadn't...\nSweetie Belle: Don't worry, Apple Bloom. Most of your family has apple-related cutie marks. I bet yours will be, too. And what's not to like about apples?\nScootaloo: There's the core, and sour apples, and rotten apples, and apples with worms in them\u2014 What?\nSweetie Belle: Not helping.\n\n[theme song]\n\nApple Bloom: I guess I just spent so much time worryin' about how to get a cutie mark, I never even thought about what would happen after. There's just so many things I never considered.\nApplejack: I'm sure there are, but you don't need to\u2014\nApple Bloom: What if I finally get my cutie mark and I don't like it? What if I get my cutie mark and nopony likes me?\nApplejack: Well, that's just ridicu\u2014\nApple Bloom: What if the Crusaders drift apart? I mean, we won't really be the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore! [gasps] What if it's not an apple?! Will I have to move out?! Where will I live?!\nApplejack: All right, that's enough, sugarcube. Those are way too many questions to answer all in one night.\nApple Bloom: But\u2014\nApplejack: And nopony's gonna make ya move out.\nApple Bloom: Are you sure, Applejack?\nApplejack: Of course, I'm sure. Now get some sleep. You'll see. Everything will be better in the mornin'.\nHush now, little sister\nYou're loved by all you know\nYou'll never lose their friendship\nNo matter where you go\n\nHush now, little sister\nYou're loved by all you know\nYou'll never lose their friendship\nNo matter where you go\n\nThere ain't no call to worry\nSo don't you cry or fret\nA cutie mark won't change you\nNo matter what you get\n[light clicks]\nApple Bloom: [yawns] No matter what I get.\n\nThere ain't no call to worry\nSo don't you cry or fret\nA cutie mark won't change you\nNo matter what you get\n\nApple Bloom: [snoring]\n[rooster crows]\nApple Bloom: Hoo-ee!

I don't know what I was so worried about last night!\nApplejack: See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep'll fix just about an\u2014 Well, no wonder you were so worked up!\nApple Bloom: What? What is it?\nApplejack: Looks like somepony got her cutie mark!\nApple Bloom: [gasps] I can't believe it! I got my cutie mark! I got my cutie mark! [rumbling and echoing] I got my cutie mark! Wait 'til I tell the others that my cutie mark is a... a... What is it?\nApplejack: I have no idea what it means.\nPest Control Pony: [muffled] I know what it means! [breathing through gas mask] It means I can retire! [laughs]\n\nApple Bloom: Infestations? You mean like... parasprites?\nPest Control Pony: Hah, please. Anypony with a trombone can get rid of parasprites. I'm talking about the serious stuff! You ever hear of... twittermites?\n[lightning cracks]\nApple Bloom: Twittermites?\nPest Control Pony: Pest ponies like you and me are the only things keeping these live wires from destroying half of Equestria!\nApple Bloom: Pest ponies?\nPest Control Pony: It's no easy trade! Even the best of us yearns for the day they can move on to greener pastures. Oh, now that you're here to take over, my day has finally come!\nApple Bloom: Take over?\nPest Control Pony: You're gonna need to stop repeating what I say and pay attention if you want to learn anything.\nApple Bloom: I'm sorry. I guess this just wasn't what I was expectin'.\nPest Control Pony: Don't worry. With a cutie mark like that I'm sure you've got the touch.\nApple Bloom: The touch? Oh, sorry.\nPest Control Pony: Now, you're gonna need to be quick. Once these things get out, it can get pretty shocking.\n[twittermites buzzing]\nApple Bloom: Wait, what do you mean?\n[zap!]\nApple Bloom: Ow!\nPest Control Pony: Hah, told you! And the further apart they spread, the more powerful these jolts will get!\nApple Bloom: What do I do?!\nPest Control Pony: Call 'em back, of course.\nApple Bloom: Twittermites! [whistles] [calling yelp]\n[twittermites buzzing]\nApple Bloom: Twittermites!\n[various zaps and vacuuming noises]\nApple Bloom: Bugbugbugbugbugbugbug!\n[vacuuming noise]\nPest Control Pony: Well, looks like you're all set. Drop me a note sometime at the Piney Shade Retirement Community.\nApple Bloom: Now, hold on! I'm sure this job is real important, but... I don't think I wanna call bugs for the rest of my life. Hey, where'd he go?\nDiamond Tiara: Well, well, well! Look at the new bug pony!\nApple Bloom: It's pest pony.\nSilver Spoon: Eh, it sure is! Ew!\nDiamond Tiara: I might've known you'd end up with the worst cutie mark ever!\nDiamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: [laughing]\nSilver Spoon: But look on the bright side! Whenever you need a friend, you can just go out and catch one!\nApple Bloom: That's not funny.\nDiamond Tiara: Heeere, friendfriendfriendfriendfrieeend!\nApple Bloom: Stop it!\nSilver Spoon: Here, bug! Here, bug! Will you be my friend, bug? Because nopony else will! [laughing]\nApple Bloom: You know what? My cutie mark isn't the worst! You two are!\nDiamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: [laughing]\n[glass cracking]\n\nApple Bloom: [sighs] I hate to think that Diamond Tiara is right, but... this cutie mark sure isn't what I was hoping for.\nMysterious Voice: Why should you have to keep it, then?\nApple Bloom: Who's there?! What do you mean?!\nMysterious Voice: If your cutie mark bothers you so much, get rid of it!\nApple Bloom: Well, if you know how to wave a hoof and erase a terrible cutie mark, you go right ahead!\nMysterious Voice: As easily said as done.\n[wind blows]\nApple Bloom: Huh. Now that is some serious magic.\n\n[ponies panicked]\nApple Bloom: Hey! Where's everypony goin'?!\n[ponies panicked]\n[Wilhelm scream]\nApple Bloom: Mayor!

Here, bugbugbugbugbugbug!\n[zap!]\nApple Bloom: Here, bugs!\n[multiple zaps]\nApple Bloom: Come on, here!\nApplejack: Apple Bloom!

We gotta skedaddle!\nApple Bloom: But I've gotta do somethin'!\nApplejack: Are you crazy?!\n[twittermites buzzing]\n[zap!]\n\nApple Bloom: [gasps]\n[zap!]\nApple Bloom: Aaaaaaahhh!\n[rooster crows]\n[glass squeaking]\nApple Bloom: Whoo-ee. That's what I call a nightmare. It seemed so real.\nApplejack: [muffled] Breakfast!\n\nApple Bloom: Applejack! You are not gonna believe the dream I just had! I guess I needed more sleep than I thought!\nApplejack: See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep'll fix just about\u2014 [gasps] Well, no wonder you were so worked up!\nApple Bloom: What?\nApplejack: Looks like somepony got her cutie mark!\nApple Bloom: Again?! I mean... I did? Woo-hoo! Potion making! Now that's more like it!\nApplejack: More like what?\nApple Bloom: Never mind. I'm just glad Princess Twilight's lessons finally paid off!\nApplejack: I expect you want to run off to the clubhouse and tell your friends all about your new cutie mark. But before you go, make sure you do all your... chores...?\n\n[horseshoe clinking]\nApple Bloom: Whooo!\nScootaloo: Why all the excitement?\nSweetie Belle: Yeah, what's going on?\nApple Bloom: [coyly] Oh, nothin'... except this brand new cutie mark!\nScootaloo: That's amazing!\nSweetie Belle: Wow!\nApple Bloom: I know!\nScootaloo: That's so cool!\nApple Bloom: I don't suppose either of you got yours?\nScootaloo: Nope.\nSweetie Belle: Me neither...\nApple Bloom: I know it's silly, but I'd always hoped we'd get our cutie marks together.\nScootaloo: Me too...\nSweetie Belle: But I'm still super excited for you!\nScootaloo: Absolutely!\nApple Bloom: I know! [knocks on podium] Let's call this meeting to order! I'm sure the three of us can figure out how to get two more cutie marks.\nSweetie Belle: Um, yeah... the thing is...\nApple Bloom: What?\nScootaloo: Well, you can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if you've already got your cutie mark...\nApple Bloom: Oh, yeah... Just like Babs Seed... Well, I could just sit quietly in the corner 'til you two figure out what you're gonna do...\nSweetie Belle: Well, technically the clubhouse is for Crusaders only.\nApple Bloom: Oh. Right. I guess I should just come back later, then...?\nSweetie Belle: Why? I mean, you can't come in then either.\nApple Bloom: Oh.\nSweetie Belle: Rules are rules.\nScootaloo: I don't even think we're still supposed to be friends.\n[door slams]\nApple Bloom: What?!\n[creepy forest noises]\nApple Bloom: Sweetie Belle! Scootaloo! Come on, fillies, this isn't funny!\n[wind blows]\nMysterious Voice: More trouble with cutie marks?\nApple Bloom: No! I mean, w\u2014 yeah, I mean... Well, I got mine, but my friends didn't get theirs, and now there's all kinds of trouble!\nMysterious Voice: Sounds to me like cutie marks and trouble are two peas in the same pod.\nApple Bloom: I guess so... I mean, if I was a blank flank again, there wouldn't be a problem!\nMysterious Voice: Your wish is my command.\n[wind blows]\n\n[crunch]\nScootaloo: Hey, Apple Bloom. Why'd you want to meet here?\nApple Bloom: Well, us blank flanks have to meet somewhere!\nScootaloo: Um, actually, Apple Bloom, we... both sort of got our cutie marks.\nApple Bloom: You did?! What are they?\nScootaloo: Oh, we don't have time to go into all that.\nSweetie Belle: And we certainly don't have time to hang out at an old clubhouse.\nScootaloo: Yeah, we've got responsibilities now.\nSweetie Belle: But maybe we'll see you later.\nScootaloo: Much later.\nApple Bloom: Wait! Hold on! I can get my cutie mark back, I think! Rrgh! I mean, I got it once, right? Oh, just wait a second! Nooooooooooo!\n[rooster crows]\nApple Bloom: What in Equestria's goin' on?!\nApplejack: [muffled] Breakfast!\nApple Bloom: I'm not so sure sleep is the cure-all Applejack thinks it is.\n\nApple Bloom: Uh... Applejack? I know you said sleep is supposed to make me feel better, but I'm pretty sure it's makin' me feel worse.\nApplejack: See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep'll fix\u2014 Well, no wonder you were so worked up...\nApple Bloom: Wh\u2014 Didn't you hear what I said?! I was trying to\u2014\nGranny Smith: Weeeell, what do we have here?\nApple Bloom: What is it, Granny? What's wrong?!\nGranny Smith: Oh, nothin', right, Applejack?\nApplejack: Right... Nothin' at all... Right, Big Mac?\nBig McIntosh: Truth is, Apple Bloom, it's your cutie mark.\nApplejack: Eeyup.\nApple Bloom: Oh, no! What is it now?!\n[spotlights turning off then on]\nBig McIntosh: [echoing] Well, I can tell you what it ain't. It ain't no apple.\nGranny Smith: Nnope!\nApple Bloom: What?!\nApplejack: [in Big McIntosh's voice] And we don't have room for non-apples.\nBig McIntosh: [in Applejack's voice] Nnope.\nGranny Smith: [in Big McIntosh's voice] Time for you to mosey on. You can't stay here.\nApple Bloom: But this is my home!\nBig McIntosh: Oh, and you're gonna have to change your name.\nGranny Smith: Eeyup!\nBig McIntosh: I think just 'Bloom' has a nice ring to it, don't you, Applejack?\nApplejack: Eeyup!\n[wind blows]\nApple Bloom: Noooooooooo!\n\n[thump]\nApple Bloom: Ugh!\nPinkie Pie: [gives rooster crow]\nApple Bloom: Alright, this is getting ridiculous. [pause] Whoo-ee! I never thought I'd be so happy to not get a cutie mark. What the?!\n[music playing backwards]\nApple Bloom: [frustrated grunt] I don't wanna see another cutie mark as long as I live!\nMysterious Voice: Back so soon?\nApple Bloom: All right, whoever you are! I dunno what spell you went and cast on me, but I want it to stop right now!\nMysterious Voice: I didn't cast a spell, on you or anypony else. I only did what you wanted.\nApple Bloom: Rrrgh! Why would I want you to torment me with nightmares?!\nMysterious Voice: You didn't want to catch bugs, and I helped. You didn't want to lose friends, and I helped. If there's a problem with your family, I'm sure I can help with that too.\nApple Bloom: I don't want your help! Just get away from me!\nPrincess Luna: Oh, Apple Bloom, you can't get away from your own shadow.\nApple Bloom: Princess Luna?! My shadow? What do you mean? It's just me? You mean I've been doin' all this to myself?\nPrincess Luna: Of course, Apple Bloom. It's your dream.\nApple Bloom: If I've been dreamin' this whole time, why don't I just wake up?\nPrincess Luna: Sometimes we can worry about a thing so much, the fear can make us feel we're trapped in a nightmare. I don't suppose there's anything you're particularly afraid of, is there?\nApple Bloom: Yeah... I guess I've been pretty worried about gettin' my cutie mark.\nPrincess Luna: Well, that is the same as worrying about who you are. That is all a cutie mark is. If you cannot accept who you are, your life might seem like a bad dream. [blows]\nApple Bloom: But if I like who I am, do you think other ponies will too?\nPrincess Luna: Of course.\nApple Bloom: Then it doesn't matter what my cutie mark is!\nPrincess Luna: Indeed.\nApple Bloom: But that's so simple! I must be the only pony in the universe this worried about her cutie mark.\nPrincess Luna: Oh, I wouldn't say that.\n[door opens]\nSweetie Belle: [exhales] [inhales]\n[cutie mark pinging]\n[bucket clunking]\n[door opens]\n[Scootaloo's wings flapping]\n[cutie mark pinging]\nScootaloo: [screams]\n[plop]\nScootaloo: [hyperventilating]\nApple Bloom: Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle are havin' nightmares too?\nPrincess Luna: It's been a busy night for us all, but I think it's time to bring it to a close.\n[door opens]\nScootaloo and Sweetie Belle: Princess Luna!\nPrincess Luna: I know you've all had a lot on your minds tonight, but I think Apple Bloom has something she'd like to share before you wake.\nSweetie Belle: We're still asleep?\nScootaloo: Cool!\nApple Bloom: Well, I guess I should call this dream meeting of the Cutie Mark Crusaders to order!\n[podium honks]\nApple Bloom: I know we all got pretty anxious when we found out Babs got her cutie mark, but I for one don't want to have nightmares every night from now until we get ours!\nScootaloo: Me neither!\nApple Bloom: And even though we're all a little scared, a cutie mark won't change who we are or how everypony feels about us!\nSweetie Belle: It's lucky we're all scared of the same things. That way we can help and remind each other to just be who we are!\nPrincess Luna: And when the day comes that you all finally get your cutie marks, you can be sure they'll fit you to a T.\nApple Bloom: Exactly!\nScootaloo: Do you fillies think that Babs is worried or scared about some of this stuff?\nApple Bloom: I know! Let's put together a care package for her!\nSweetie Belle: That way she'll know she isn't alone!\nApple Bloom: We wouldn't want her to think that just because she isn't a Crusader, we can't still be friends! But, uh... maybe we should wait 'til we wake up.\nPrincess Luna: Good idea.\n\nApple Bloom: [gasps]\n[rooster crows]\nApple Bloom: [sighs]\n\n[pancakes splatting]\n[Applejack]\nThere ain't no call to worry\nSo don't you cry or fret\n[Apple Bloom]\nA cutie mark won't change me\nNo matter what I get\nApplejack: Well, sure looks like somepony's feelin' better.\nApple Bloom: You have no idea.\nApplejack: See, now what did I tell you?

And don't forget the best part \u2013 our first winter together! Come on, wake up! Once those ponies bring in the big, fat clouds full of snowflakes, we'll have a ton of snow for our extreme sledding!

He's perfectly fine.\nRainbow Dash: [relieved sigh]\nFluttershy: He's just going to hibernate.\nRainbow Dash: You do realize he's not a bear, right?\nFluttershy: [giggles] When the weather grows cold and less food is available, many animals hibernate to conserve energy. It's like taking a really long nap during winter, and then they wake up in spring. And see? Even tortoises do it! When the time comes, Tank will leave and dig into the ground.\nTank: [yawns]\nFluttershy: But don't worry. He'll reappear when the spring sun warms the ground back up.\nRainbow Dash: Come on! Tortoises don't hibernate! Somepony put that picture in there as a joke.\nFluttershy: It's not a joke.\nRainbow Dash: Well, then your book must be wrong!\nFluttershy: Rainbow Dash, Tank needs to hibernate.

Building snow ponies, starting snowball fights, sipping hot cider by the fire.\nTank: [snores]\nRainbow Dash: Don't you wanna do those things with me?! Think, Rainbow Dash, think!

Are you alright?\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] No...\n\nTank: [yawns]\n[door opens]\nPinkie Pie: Knock, knock!\nFluttershy: How are you feeling, Rainbow Dash?\nRainbow Dash: [despondently] Whatever...\nRarity: The poor thing looks so sad! Just what are we doing to do?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know what we can do.\nApplejack: Buck up, Sugarcube. You just ain't yourself these days.\nRainbow Dash: [despondently] Whatever...\nRarity: Uh, how can I say this tactfully...? You've lost your sparkle, Rainbow Dash.\nPinkie Pie: I hate to say this, but, well... you've become...! [hushed] A party pooper!\nRainbow Dash: Didn't you hear me? I said 'whatever'. I don't know if you're here to cheer me up or what, but I'm fine.\nFluttershy: Let me handle this. Rainbow Dash, your winter is going to be pet-less.\n[beat]\nRainbow Dash: [sobbing]\nRarity: Whatever did you do that for?!\nFluttershy: Because she'll never get past this until she lets it all out.\nRainbow Dash: [more sobbing]\nApplejack: [awkwardly] Uh... it's okay. Tank'll come back in a few months.\nRainbow Dash: Months?! [crying] I don't want him to go! [continues sobbing under]\nApplejack: Alright, alright. There, there. [hushed, to Fluttershy] Nice going, Fluttershy. How do we get her to stop?\nFluttershy: [hushed] She's got to be about done by now. Can't be too much left in there.\nRainbow Dash: [more crying, then stops]\nFluttershy: Feeling better?\nRainbow Dash: [sniffs] Uh-huh. [suddenly resumes crying]\nFluttershy: Oh, you poor, poor thing... [starts crying]\nRarity: [starts crying] I can't bear to see Fluttershy cry!\nPinkie Pie: [starts crying] It's just heart-wrenching!\nFluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity: [crying hysterically]\nTwilight Sparkle: [to Applejack] You too?!\nApplejack: Nope, I'm good.\nTwilight Sparkle: Look, everypony, I know how hard it is to say goodbye\u2014\nPinkie Pie: [crying] I'm mostly sad because you're not sad!\nTwilight Sparkle: What?! Me?! What about Applejack?\nPinkie Pie: [crying] Applejack cries on the inside, Twilight!\nApplejack: It's true.\nRainbow Dash: [settling down] It's alright, Fluttershy. It's alright.\nApplejack: [hushed] You think she's done or just getting a third wind?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know... Rainbow Dash? Are you okay?\nRainbow Dash: [sniffling] I think so. I feel better. Really, I do. Thanks, everypony. I don't know what I'd do without you. [tearing up] Or him... [sniffs] Oh, Tank... I'm sure gonna miss you.\n\n[sledding and skating noises]\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, guess we're starting winter with a bang.\nApplejack: The fun's come early! Yee-haw!\n[splut]\nPinkie Pie: You think we could mess up winter every year? It's way less work!\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, I don't think Rainbow Dash could handle it.\nRainbow Dash: Riding that entire season from Cloudsdale to Ponyville was pretty awesome.\nTank: [yawns]\nRainbow Dash: I thought you guys might like to say goodbye to Tank. He's ready to hibernate.\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, you're using the word! Oh, she's using the word! And when Tank finishes hibernating, I'm gonna throw him the biggest welcome home party ever! Or wait. Should it be a 'welcome above ground' party? Or a 'happy wake-up' party? Maybe an 'it's about time!' party!\nRarity: And I'll design him a very special suit just for the occasion, whichever one it ends up being.\nApplejack: I'm glad you're feelin' a little better, Rainbow Dash.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, me too.\n[digging in snow]\nRainbow Dash: So, you really wanna do this hibernating thing, huh?\nRarity: Goodbye, Tank.\nFluttershy: Happy winter.\nApplejack: See you later, little feller.\nPinkie Pie: Have a good sleep, Tank!\nTwilight Sparkle: Goodbye, Tank! We'll miss you!\n[snow sliding]\nTwilight Sparkle: Well? Ready for some winter fun?\nRainbow Dash: Uh, I'm gonna hang here and read to him a bit. That little guy can never get to sleep without a bedtime story. I'll be right there.\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nApple Bloom: Aren't you glad y'all came with me to see Applejack compete in the Appleloosa rodeo?\nScootaloo: Totally! This place is a cutie mark gold mine! There's barrel racing...\n[klonks]\nScootaloo: ...roping contests, rodeo clowning...\n[thwack]\nScootaloo: ...steeplechase...!\nApple Bloom: If we can get into some of these events, we could all three walk off the train back in Ponyville with brand spankin' new cutie marks!\nScootaloo: Wouldn't a barrel look good here?\nApple Bloom: I want a lasso!\nSweetie Belle: I don't know... All these events look a little, well, dangerous.\nApple Bloom: No risk, no reward.\nSheriff Silverstar: Alright, everypony, listen up! We need a big presence at this here rodeo, so make yourself plenty seen! I want that low-down varmint to know we mean business!\nSweetie Belle: I hope nothing bad is going on.\nApple Bloom: A cutie mark-apalooza and a low-down varmint? This is shapin' up to be the most excitin' rodeo ever!\nScootaloo: Yeah, come on!\n[Western harmonica riff]\n\n[theme song]\n\n[bale being tossed]\nBraeburn: Woo-hoo! Yee-haw! That's my cousin! Go, Applejack, go!\nApplejack: Whew! It's been a dog's age since I got to compete. All the rodeos 'round Ponyville are closed down for some reason.\nBraeburn: Well, I guess havin' injured kinfolk in Appleloosa sure paid off then, huh, cuz?\nApplejack: Just doin' my best to fill your horseshoes, Braeburn.\nBraeburn: Keep tossin' like that and I'll be out of a job!\n[poink!]\nBraeburn: Ow, ow!\nApplejack: Ooh, sorry. Say, where's my sister and her friends?\nBraeburn: Uh-oh. Gee, uh, I guess I got so caught up watchin' you that I\u2014\nApplejack: You said you'd keep an eye on those fillies! How am I supposed to focus on practicin' if you're not gonna\u2014\nBraeburn: There they are! Heh, right where I left 'em... Aw, don't be mad! [beat] Owwwwch! My foreleg! Hurts so much...!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [giggling]\nApplejack: Y'all can't go runnin' off like that, y'hear? Backstage at a rodeo ain't no kind of playground!\nApple Bloom: Sorry, Applejack. We won't wander off again. But, uh, speakin' of the rodeo... what would you say about me and the Crusaders maybe competin' in one teensy-weensy little event or three?\nBraeburn: Look out!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [yelps]\n[myriad thumps]\nApplejack: [gasps] What the hay just happened?\nBraeburn: You fillies alright?\nApple Bloom and Scootaloo: Uh-huh...\nSweetie Belle: [simultaneously] Yeah...\nSheriff Silverstar: Sugar and salt licks! Well, I'll be...\nApplejack: What is it, Sheriff?\nBraeburn: Is it him?\nSheriff Silverstar: Ain't no doubt. It's Trouble Shoes.\nCaramel: [Western harmonica riff]\nSheriff Silverstar: [surprised snort]\n\nCrowd: [shouting]\nTownspony 1: Is it true? Is Trouble Shoes here?\nTownspony 2: You ain't gonna shut down the rodeo, are ya?!\nSheriff Silverstar: All right now, I called for a meetin', not a mob scene. Now, as many of you know, the Equestria rodeo circuit has been plagued by the dirty dealin's of a notorious outlaw.\nTownspony 3: He knocked barrels every which way at the Hoof City rodeo! Nearly crushed my Aunt Bae Mare!\nTownspony 4: That's nothin'! He sabotaged the steer pen at Pinto Creek rodeo, settin' off such a stampede they cancelled the whole dadgum thing!\nCrowd: [shouting]\nSheriff Silverstar: Now, now, it's true we had an incident this mornin' at our own Appleloosa rodeo. Hay bale stack came down right near on top of three little fillies! I examined them hoof-prints myself and, uh... it was Trouble Shoes, all right.\nCrowd: [gasps]\nSheriff Silverstar: I reckon I oughta cancel this rodeo like all the others done. But dag-hoof it, this has gone far enough! We'll double the patrols! This rodeo will go on! Appleloosa ain't gonna be intimidated!\n[ponies cheering]\nApple Bloom: Glad that's settled. So, uh, Applejack, about me and my pals competin' in the rodeo... [nervous chuckle]\n\nApple Bloom: Don't send us home! It's not fair!\nApplejack: Now, quit yer bellyachin'. I can't have y'all around here with some outlaw on the loose. Aw, maybe I oughta call it quits and go home too.\nBraeburn: No, you can't! This rodeo is important to Appleloosa! And with you in there, we got a real shot at winnin'! Come on, now, you head on back to practice and don't worry none about these three. I won't let 'em outta my sight.\n[door slams, locks click, chair drags]\nBraeburn: [to Crusaders] Ya hear? Y'all ain't leavin' my sight!\n\nBraeburn: [snores]\n[window opens]\nSweetie Belle: I thought we weren't going to wander off again.\nApple Bloom: This ain't wanderin'. We know exactly where we're headed \u2013 to find Trouble Shoes!\nSweetie Belle: But isn't he a dangerous criminal?\nApple Bloom: We only need to find him. We don't need to capture him. The sheriff can handle that!\nScootaloo: And once he's in jail, we'll be competing! And then it's...\nApple Bloom and Scootaloo: Cutie mark city!\nSweetie Belle: Worst idea ever.\n\n[owl hoots]\nApple Bloom: It's another giant hoof print!\nSweetie Belle: Do either of you have any idea where we are?\n[lightning cracks]\n[rain starts falling]\nScootaloo: Uh, maybe we should head back and try again later.\nApple Bloom: C'mon, before we lose the trail!\n[lightning cracks]\nSweetie Belle: [high-pitched squeal]\n\nSweetie Belle: Come on, we've gone far enough! It's time to go back!\nScootaloo: The rain is only getting worse, Apple Bloom! Let's come back tomorrow.\nApple Bloom: Maybe y'all are right. So, how do we get back?\nSweetie Belle: You mean you don't know?!\n[lightning cracks]\n\nApplejack: Whew! Good job, y'all. I know they need lots of mud for the rodeo tomorrow, but I wish they would've warned us about this rainstorm.\nBraeburn: [whinnies]\nApplejack: Braeburn? Where are the girls?\nBraeburn: [nervous laugh]\nApplejack: [echoing] What?!\n\nSheriff Silverstar: Ha! Fish my wish!\nStar Spur: Aw!\nSenior Deputy: Dagnabbit!\nApplejack: Sheriff Silverstar! You gotta help! My sister's gone! And her friends too!\nBraeburn: I've searched and searched, but no sign of 'em anywhere!\nApplejack: It must've been Trouble Shoes!\nSheriff Silverstar: Now, now, hold on there. Trouble Shoes done a lot of bad things in his day, but nothin' like that!\nApplejack: You really wanna take that chance?\nSheriff Silverstar: Come on, y'all! Let's ride!\n\nSweetie Belle: You sure about this, Scootaloo?\nScootaloo: I thought I was, but now I'm not.\nApple Bloom: So I pretty much got us completely and totally lost. How could this get any worse?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [screaming]\n[splash]\nApple Bloom: We gotta get out of this rain. There's no tellin' how long this storm could last.\nScootaloo: Look!\nApple Bloom: It looks abandoned. Let's go see if we can find some blankets or somethin'.\n[door creaking]\n[lightning cracks]\n[hoofsteps falling]\n[door creaking]\n[lightning cracks]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [screaming]\nTrouble Shoes: [screaming]\n[multiple crashes]\nTrouble Shoes: [multiple exclamations of surprise and pain]\n[thwack]\n[tinnitus]\nTrouble Shoes: [groaning]\nApple Bloom: [through tinnitus] Hello? You alright?\nTrouble Shoes: Surely.\nApple Bloom: We didn't mean no harm. We just came in to get out of the rain.\nTrouble Shoes: Had some hot cider a-cookin' in the kitchen. Doubt it survived.\n[clang]\nTrouble Shoes: I ain't gonna rise to greet y'all. Awfully rude, I reckon, but as you can see, I'm the fresh casualty of an unusually unfortunate circumstance. My lot in life, I suppose.\nApple Bloom: Are you... Trouble Shoes?\nTrouble Shoes: That's me.\nScootaloo: W-what are you doing?\nApple Bloom: I'm gonna unwrap him.\nSweetie Belle: You can't do that! That's Trouble Shoes!\nApple Bloom: Aw, he don't seem so bad.\n[lightning cracks]\nTrouble Shoes: Of course guests would arrive while I ain't got no pie to offer. Scores more misfortune points for old Trouble Shoes. Wh-whooaaa!\n[crash, bonks]\nTrouble Shoes: Typical. Bad luck never rests.\nApple Bloom: You sure that's bad luck? Seems like maybe you're just a little, um...\nSweetie Belle: Klutzy?\nTrouble Shoes: Tell that to the flank! Upside-down horseshoe \u2013 bad luck. Follows me wherever I go like sour on old milk. Y'all best vamoose before my bad luck rubs off and sticks to y'all. Get along! Skedaddle!\n[lightning cracks]\nTrouble Shoes: Am-scray!\nScootaloo: Um, we don't really know the way back to Appleloosa...\nTrouble Shoes: But o' course I do. Wouldn't you know it? My lucky day.\n\nSweetie Belle: It's actually kind of sweet of him to help us out like this.\nScootaloo: I know! What do we do if he takes us back to Appleloosa and the sheriff arrests him? If I get a cutie mark for that, I'll feel guilty every time I see it.\nApple Bloom: Say there, Trouble Shoes, you might not want to take us all the way back to Appleloosa. The sheriff sort of has it in his mind that you're a no-good outlaw lookin' to shut down the rodeo.\nTrouble Shoes: My kind of luck he'd think that.\nApple Bloom: But... is it true?\nTrouble Shoes: Y'all like stories?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Mm-hmm!\nTrouble Shoes: Just my luck. I was hopin' you'd say no. [narrating flashback] When I was a colt, I wanted to be a rodeo star somethin' fierce, but I just didn't seem to have the knack for it.\n[thwack]\nYoung Trouble Shoes: Whoooa!\nBuffalo: [laughing]\nYoung Trouble Shoes: [grunting] Awww!\nBuffalo: [laughing]\nTrouble Shoes: [narrating] I practiced and practiced...\nYoung Trouble Shoes: Whoooa-oof!\nTrouble Shoes: [narrating] And finally, I wrangled up the guts to audition for rodeo school. Right in the middle of that tryout, I knew I was doin' what I was meant to. And wouldn't you know it? In a flash comes this here cutie mark.\n[whip lashing noise]\n[thunk]\nJudges: [laughing]\nTrouble Shoes: [narrating] I can still remember them judges a-laughin'. Didn't even finish my routine 'cause right then I knew bad luck was my fate. That fire for rodeo never did leave me, though. Couldn't keep away from 'em. So I'd sneak down and have a look, and wouldn't you know it? Bad luck would strike again. Just my lot in life, I reckon...\nSweetie Belle: Poor Trouble Shoes. I can't believe those mean judges would laugh at him like that.\nApple Bloom: Don't you see? They weren't laughin' at him. They were just enjoyin' the show.\nScootaloo: What are you saying?\nApple Bloom: Think about it. If we saw a rodeo clown doin' what he did back in that shack, we'd think he was the greatest!\nSweetie Belle: You're right! He could still be in rodeos, just not the way he thought!\nScootaloo: So he's been looking at his cutie mark wrong the whole time! It's not bad luck, it's\u2014\nSheriff Silverstar: Gotcha!\nTrouble Shoes: Just my luck.\nSheriff Silverstar: Trouble Shoes, you're under arrest for vandalizin' the property and peace of mind of the good rodeo-lovin' ponies of Equestria! Not to mention fillynappin'! And... generalized mayhem!\nApple Bloom: Wait!\nApplejack: Braeburn? Get these fillies someplace safe.\nApple Bloom: Wait, no! Listen, Applejack!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: No!\n\nApple Bloom: But Trouble Shoes isn't the menace everypony thinks!\nApplejack: Sakes alive, what's with you? Why in tarnation would you want me to help get him out of jail when he's the one who ran off with y'all to begin with?! Now if y'all excuse me, I'm off to win the Appleloosa rodeo hay bale monster stack.\nApple Bloom: Um, Applejack?\n[door closes]\n\nTrouble Shoes: [sighs] Well, at least I get me a view of one small corner of the rodeo.\n[bed creaking, crash]\nTrouble Shoes: Figures.\nSheriff Silverstar: Aw, come on now, Trouble Shoes! I'm runnin' out of mattresses!\n[magic fizzling]\n[keys jingling]\n[door opens]\nApple Bloom: Come on, sheriff! You're about to miss the hay bale monster stack!\nSheriff Silverstar: Jiminy, that's startin' already?!\n[jail door opens]\nApple Bloom: Let's go, Trouble Shoes! This here's a jailbreak!\nTrouble Shoes: Ain't no need. Can hear the rodeo just fine from this vantage.\nScootaloo: But we've got a plan to help you live your dream!\nTrouble Shoes: Listen, y'all, I'm a known criminal. How you proposin' on gettin' me into a rodeo?\n[bed creaks and clatters]\n\n[crowd cheering]\n[bale being kicked]\nApple Bloom: Go, Applejack!\nScootaloo: [simultaneously] You can do it!\nSweetie Belle: [simultaneously] Woo-hoo!\nTrouble Shoes: Well, how do I look?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [giggling]\nTrouble Shoes: Come on now, stack them bales! Woo-hoo!\n[bale being kicked]\n[crowd gasps]\n[crowd cheers]\nApple Bloom: That's my sister!\n[entertainment music starts, crowd laughs]\nApple Bloom: 'Kay now, Trouble Shoes, you're on!\nTrouble Shoes: Say what?! I may be dressed like one, but I ain't no rodeo clown.\nApple Bloom: You got your cutie mark all wrong, Trouble Shoes! You were born to entertain! You've got a gift for makin' folks laugh, don't you?\nTrouble Shoes: But my cutie mark's an upside-down horseshoe, and that means bad luck.\nSweetie Belle: That all depends on how you look at it.\nApple Bloom: You always wanted to be a part of the rodeo, right? Well, now's your chance. Go on!\nTrouble Shoes: Whoa!\n[boing!]\n[crowd laughs]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [cheering]\nApplejack: There y'all are! How 'bout your big sis, huh?\nApple Bloom: [flatly] Yeah, way to go.\nApplejack: Since when are y'all so into rodeo clowns?\n[crashes]\n[crowd laughs]\nTrouble Shoes: Just leave me be, cutie mark! I aim to clear that there hoop!\n[crowd laughs]\n[crashing]\nTrouble Shoes: [muffled grunts] Come on now! [grunting]\n[multiple plops]\n[click, slide whistle]\n[crowd laughs]\nApplejack: That's the best rodeo clown I ever seen! [laughs]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [cheering]\n[pop]\n[muffled laughing]\n[splash]\n[pop]\n[crowd gasps]\nCrowd: Trouble Shoes!\nApplejack: What the hay?!\nFemale Townspony #1: He escaped from jail!\nMale Townspony #1: Ruinin' another rodeo!\nFemale Townspony #2: Let's get him!\n[crowd shouting]\nApple Bloom: Wait, y'all! He ain't what you think he is!\nSheriff Silverstar: Stand aside, young'uns! This one's goin' back to jail.\nSweetie Belle: But he never wanted to ruin any rodeos! Those were just bad accidents!\nApplejack: Sweetie Belle, what are you talkin' about?\nScootaloo: Trouble Shoes has a gift for making ponies laugh! He's maybe the best rodeo clown I've ever seen!\nJudge: That's true! He is awful funny.\nApple Bloom: He thought his cutie mark was telling him to keep away from rodeos, but deep inside he knew it's where he was meant to be. He just didn't know how to do it.\n[crowd muttering]\nTrouble Shoes: What she says is true. This here entertainin' y'all with my klutzin'? That's what I was supposed to be doin'. I know it now. I didn't mean no harm, honest! I just ain't never loved nothin' like I love the rodeo, so I kept on sneakin' back and makin' a big old mess of things. Turns out I was just a-lookin' at my cutie mark all wrong.\nSheriff Silverstar: That may be so, Trouble Shoes, but you still gotta face charges for the problems you've caused!\nTrouble Shoes: If I done wrong, I'll see to it that I take my medicine and square my accounts.\nSheriff Silverstar: Truth be told, we could understand all the trouble with the rodeos, but why'd you have to run off with these here little'uns last night?\nApple Bloom: Uh, yeah, about that...\n\n[barrel rolling]\n[sweeping]\nApple Bloom: [sighs] You really want us to clean up all this mess Trouble Shoes made?\nApplejack: Maybe it'll teach you not to go wanderin' off after I say not to!\nApple Bloom: Ugh. Ain't it bad enough that you get to go back to Ponyville with a shiny trophy, and all we're bringing back is these same old blank flanks?\nApplejack: Y'all helped Trouble Shoes realize what his cutie mark really means. Ain't that a nice feelin' you can take back with you?\nSweetie Belle: I guess we did make things a little better.\nScootaloo: It does feel kinda nice.\nApple Bloom: So... we can stop now?\nApplejack: Nnope.\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nDiscord: Ohoho, but that's not all!

[through gritted teeth] Keep it under control!\nDiscord: Yes, yes, yes, of course. Tell me, have you seen Fluttershy anywhere?\n\nCutie Mark Crusaders: We're here! We're here! We made it to the Gala!\nFluttershy: [giggles] Really? [giggles]\nTree Hugger: The aura coming off the waterfall was so alive! So, like, magic manifestation.\nFluttershy: Wow.\nDiscord: Oh, Fluttershy. I didn't see you there.\nFluttershy: How did you even know to look for an aura on a waterfall?\nDiscord: [clears throat irritably, hacks, coughs]\nFluttershy: Discord! I thought you weren't coming!\nDiscord: No. I actually never said that. But funny how you remembered it that way. Anyway, good to see you. Tree Friend, is it? Your name is slipping my mind right now. How strange.\nTree Hugger: Nice to meet you. I'm Tree Hugger. Blessings.\nDiscord: You have met me before actually! [snorts]\nTree Hugger: Cool! Like, in another life, maybe?\nDiscord: You've gotta be kidding. You don't remember me?\nTree Hugger: [laughs] I meet a lot of different creatures, each one of them perfect and unique.\nDiscord: Yes, well, as I was saying, it's just great to be here with my oldest, bestest friend.\nFluttershy: Am I really your oldest, bestest friend?\nDiscord: You? [laughs] Of course not! You think I don't have other friends? I'm centuries old! I was talking about the Smooze! Smooze Face, the Smoozinator \u2013 well, I mean that's what we called him back in college. Smooze! I would like you to meet Fluttershy and, um, hmm... Tree... how'd you say it... Tree Embrace?\nTree Hugger: Oh, I like that! It's so in rhythm with my life force! [gasps] Maybe I'll change it!\n[splat!]\nFluttershy: [giggles] I can't believe I've never heard you speak of the Smooze before. Sounds like you two are so close.\nDiscord: Well, I'm glad you got that, because that's what is true. We are.\n[magic poof]\nDiscord: Very close.\nFluttershy: That's wonderful! The four of us should go out to dinner sometime!\n[splat!]\nDiscord: We should all go out to dinner sometime?! Have you no heart?\nPony: [screams]\nDiscord: Oh, oh! It looks like somepony wants to mingle. We'll be back in a bit.\nFluttershy: Oh, okay. Treezie and I would love to talk to you more later!\nDiscord: Treezie? Really? Sort of a juvenile nickname, don't you think?\n[smashing glass]\nPony: [screams]\nDiscord: Smoozie! Wait up!\n\nDiscord: Now, listen, Smooze. I need to make this a party of one for a little while. Just stay out here until I come for you.\n[door slams, lock clicks]\nApple Bloom, Applejack, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Scootaloo and Tree Hugger: [laughing]\n[magic poof]\nDiscord: [laughing loudly]\nTree Hugger: What's so funny?\nDiscord: Exactly!\nRainbow Dash: Uhh... I think we're gonna go hit the dance floor.\nDiscord: Fluttershy, tell the Hugs here about the time that we went to the store and came back with two cakes instead of one, because that's how crazy we are when we're together.\nFluttershy: Um, we went to the store and bought two cakes.\nDiscord: Oh. Well, you kind of left out all the fun and frivolity there. But I'm sure you got it, Tree Hugger.\nTree Hugger: I got that you really like cake.\nDiscord: We like each other. That was the point! I'm actually pretty lukewarm about cake.\nRarity: [muffled screaming] Let me in!\n[thumping]\n[lock clicks]\nRarity: [gasps for breath] That creature took my jewels!\nThe Smooze: [magical hum]\nTwilight Sparkle: Discord! I thought I told you to keep your friend under control!\nDiscord: Oh, please. I have better things to do than to watch that thing all night. [laughs nervously] What I mean to say is, that thing is a dear, dear friend, and I'll make sure that the ooze, uh, that he can't help but secrete doesn't get on anypony else.\n[vacuum cleaner running]\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you. It's alright, everypony. Let's just get back to enjoying this magical evening!\nDiscord: [to the Smooze] You are making me look like a fool in front of Fluttershy. I'll be back when the Gala is over.\n[door slams]\nThe Smooze: [licks]\n\n[magic poof]\nFluttershy: [laughing] Oh, Tree Hugger, I've never known anypony as funny as you!\nPonies: [gasp]\n[microphone feedback]\nDiscord: Check, check, check. Is this thing on? Good evening, fillies and germs! I just flew into Canterlot, and wow, are my interspecies parts tired!\n[rimshot]\n[silence]\nDiscord: I've only got these tiny mismatched wings, and even I can fly better than Twilight Sparkle! Am I right? Pchoo!\n[rimshot]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey!\nPrincess Celestia: [giggles]\nDiscord: [laughs nervously] Uh, well, perhaps you're into more observational humor.\n[magic poof]\nDiscord: Did you ever notice how you always materialize out of thin air? Why not thick air? What's the deal there?\n[rimshot]\nS01E26 Unnamed Earth Mare #1: [coughs]\nDiscord: Tough crowd.\nTwilight Sparkle: What is he doing?!\nRainbow Dash: I think they're... jokes?\nPinkie Pie: Maud! Jokes!\nMaud Pie: My favorite.\nDiscord: [muffled and out of focus] You might be a Ponyville pony when an ordinary night on the town ends in a lesson about friendship! [in focus] Knock knock!\n[beat]\nDiscord: You're supposed to say \"Who's there?\"! This is the most basic of jokes!\n[thud, splat]\nMaud Pie: You're the most basic of jokes.\n[ponies laughing]\nPinkie Pie: Good one, Maud!\n[colt trembling]\nThe Smooze: [slithering]\nTwilight Sparkle: What is that?!\n\n[ponies screaming]\n[Wilhelm scream]\nRainbow Dash: [straining]\n[splat]\n[magic zaps]\nTwilight Sparkle: None of my magic works on this ooze! Can you stop it?\n[splut]\nPrincess Celestia: I'm afraid not!\nTwilight Sparkle: Discord, how could you bring him here?!\nDiscord: Oh, he's not that bad!\nRarity: Oh, my shoes will be ruined forever!\nApplejack: That's what you're worried about? Really?\n[spluts]\nTree Hugger: This is kind of a bummer.\nDiscord: Isn't it, though? And to think, it would never have happened had I come to the Gala as somepony else's plus-one.\nTree Hugger: Seems like something might have harshed his flow, you know? Like, his senses are agitated.\nDiscord: You don't know anything about rare creatures. I've known Smooze Face for ages. He's not agitated. He's partying down! Whoo!\nTree Hugger: All he needs is some, like, calming auditory therapy. I know I always feel really at peace when I'm being bathed in positive vibes. Maybe he'll calm down with some sonic bliss.\nDiscord: Do you even know what you just said?\nTree Hugger: Ommmm. Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee! Ommmm. Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!\nThe Smooze: [bubbling]\nTree Hugger: Let go, Smooze! Bliss out! Ommmm. Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!\nThe Smooze: [grins]\nSweetie Belle: It worked!\nEverypony: [cheering]\nRainbow Dash: Way to go, Tree Hugger!\nFluttershy: That was the most magical thing I've ever seen done with animals!\nDiscord: [grinding teeth]\nTree Hugger: Oh, thanks, everypony. It makes perfect karmic sense why magic doesn't work on him. He only responds to vibrations that peace out his energy fields.\nDiscord: Stop it! Stop it! That's it! I'm done with you, Tree Hugger!\nTree Hugger: Oh, man. You're really bumming me out. Can you just, like, lower your voice a skosh?\nDiscord: A skosh? A skosh?!\n[magic noises]\nTree Hugger: Whoa, dude! What is that?!\nDiscord: Relax. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm simply going to send you to another dimension. I can't have you interfering in my relationship with Fluttershy anymore!\nFluttershy: Discord, stop!\nDiscord: I will, just as soon as she's gone! Then we can have a good laugh about this whole affair over our regular Tuesday tea. [sips]\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't worry, Fluttershy! We'll stop him!\n[disco ball bouncing]\nMain cast sans Fluttershy: [screaming]\nDiscord: I'm doing her a favor, Fluttershy! It's a lovely dimension! White sand beaches, attentive wait staff... I mean, okay, the humidity isn't great, but where isn't that the case these days?\nFluttershy: I don't understand why you're doing this! We were all getting along so well!\nDiscord: As well as we could, considering you've already stomped all over our friendship by inviting her to the biggest night of the year as if I didn't matter at all!\nFluttershy: Did you really think I'd abandon you just because I have a new friend?!\nDiscord: Yes, because that's what you did!\nFluttershy: No, Discord! I invited a friend to a party! I didn't abandon you! What if you had a friend that you could discuss chaos-based magic with? Would that mean we weren't friends anymore?!\nDiscord: Uh... [stuttering] No, I suppose not. It would just mean that I'd have different friends for different things... Oh, oh, dear, it looks like I've perhaps overreacted just a skosh.\nFluttershy: More like a lot of skoshes! Tree Hugger, could you give us a minute?\nDiscord: I'm just so new at this whole friendship thing. It's so much more complicated than it looks.\nFluttershy: Do you think maybe you owe somepony an apology? Not me!\nDiscord: Oh! Oh. [clears throat] Yes, right. [snaps fingers]\n[magic zaps]\nThe Smooze: [slithering]\n[magic zap]\nDiscord: Er, Tree Hugger, I'm sorry that you got caught in the middle of my... er, you know... wrath.\nTree Hugger: Oh, it's all groovy. Um, I need like a few minutes to clear out my chakras before I can hug you from a place of authenticity.\nDiscord: Oh, your chakras. [laughs nervously] Fair enough.\n\nDiscord: I owe you an apology, Smooze. I spent the whole evening thinking about my own feelings and never thinking about yours.\nThe Smooze: [kisses]\nDiscord: Well, friends! I think I may actually grow to like this multiple-friend thing.\nMaud Pie: I like it too.\nPinkie Pie: Hey, it's not a party until somepony spreads magic-resistant ooze uncontrollably over the ballroom! [squee] Come on, Smoozinator! Let's dance!\nThe Smooze: [slithering]\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sorry, Princess Celestia. I thought I could give you a break tonight, but it turns out I was in over my head.\nPrincess Celestia: You have nothing to apologize for. This has been the most fun Gala in years!\nTwilight Sparkle: I know, it was a\u2014What?! But there was ooze all over the place! And one of the guests threatened to send somepony to another dimension!\nPrincess Celestia: I know! Can you imagine how dull it would have been if I hadn't invited Discord? Come on! Whoo! The night is still young!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nPinkie Pie: La, la-la, la-la! La, la-la, la-la, la la-la la-la! This is gonna be so great, Gummy! We have absolutely nothing to do today except bake! I've been waiting for just the right time to finally try Granny Pie's super-special triple-chocolate, fifteen-layer marjolaine recipe! It's gonna be amazing!\nGummy: [licks]\nPinkie Pie: Let's see. Nutty meringue, chocolate ganache, praline and nuts, cocoa-flavored buttercream...\n[cutie mark ringing]\nPinkie Pie: An hour per layer \u2013 that's fifteen hours of pure baking bliss!\n[oven opens and closes]\n[cutie mark ringing]\nPinkie Pie: Okay, Gummy, I think we're ready to start prepping the second layer!\n[cutie mark ringing]\nPinkie Pie: Oh, my gosh! My cutie mark! [gasps] You know what this means?! [hushed] The map!\nGummy: [licks]\n[door shuts]\n[door opens]\nPinkie Pie: Uh, Gummy? Could you take over for a bit? Hopefully this'll be quick. I'll just measure the baking powder for you... [squee] ...and when the first layer cools, you can drizzle some of the ganache over it. And don't forget to beat the egg whites for the meringue!\n[cutie mark ringing]\nPinkie Pie: I know you can do this, Gummy! You're the best alligator baker I've ever met! [kisses]\n[door shuts]\nGummy: [creaking] [thud] [blinks]\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: This is so exciting. The map is summoning you to Griffonstone, the very heart of the griffon kingdom! I don't know if either of you have read \"Bygone Griffons of Greatness\", but griffons were known to be\u2014\nRainbow Dash: Rude, insensitive bullies?\nTwilight Sparkle: You mean Gilda?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, I mean Gilda! When she came to Ponyville, she was a total jerk to all my friends, especially Pinkie Pie!\nPinkie Pie: She was a bit of a party pooper.\nRainbow Dash: Mm-hmm.\nTwilight Sparkle: So, maybe Gilda was a little rude. You still get to go to Griffonstone, and according to this book, it has a rich, fascinating history! [narrating] In ancient times, griffons were known to be as greedy as dragons, always hoarding their bits and other treasures. But all that changed when King Grover found the mysterious golden Idol of Boreas. Legend says the Idol of Boreas was made from the dust of golden sunsets, blown across the mountains by the north winds. Possessing the Idol of Boreas filled the griffons' hearts with pride. It's said that that one great treasure is responsible for turning Griffonstone into the most majestic kingdom of all the land.\nRainbow Dash: And why do you care so much about griffons anyway?\nTwilight Sparkle: It was actually Gilda's visit that made me curious. So I picked up \"Bygone Griffons of Greatness\", and I've been hooked ever since! And now... [sigh] Now you two get to see Griffonstone with your very own eyes.\nPinkie Pie: Huh? Just me and Rainbow Dash?\nRainbow Dash: Hey, you can totally take my place if you want. [yawn] I still have half a nap to finish.\nPinkie Pie: Why don't you just come with us? I mean, you are the Princess of Friendship.\nTwilight Sparkle: No, no, if the map wanted me to go to the coolest kingdom in all of Equestria and tour the palace and see the actual idol that unites an entire species, which would be super amazing, I'm sure it would've said so. You two can handle whatever the issue is just fine. I'll stay here and do important princessy things. I guess.\nPinkie Pie: Well then, come on, Dashie! We're going to Griffonstone!\nRainbow Dash: [sigh] Fine...\nPinkie Pie: That's the spirit! [blows party horn]\n\n[train whistle]\n[train chugging]\nPinkie Pie: Whatcha reading, Rainbow?\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Twilight literally wrote a book on what we need to do in Griffonstone.\nPinkie Pie: You mean like a guide on how to figure out what problem we're supposed to fix?\nRainbow Dash: And then some. It's like Twilight herself in book form. [imitating Twilight] \"Always carry plenty of bits. The griffons are sure to help you as long as you share the wealth.\"\n[bits clinking]\n[cart squeaking]\nPinkie Pie: [swallows] Uh, can I borrow some bits?\n\n[train chugging]\nTwilight Sparkle: [voiceover] Upon arriving in Griffon Gorge, be sure to pause and cast your eyes northerly, up the Hyperborean Mountains, taking in the breathtaking beauty of Griffonstone. Once in Griffonstone proper, go immediately to the palace and introduce yourself to the king. \"Bygone Griffons of Greatness\" was written a long time ago, and it ends with the coronation of the fourteenth king of the griffons, King Guto. I have no idea who's in charge now. Tell the king you've been sent by the Princess of Friendship, and you're there to help with some sort of problem. If for some reason the king can't help, I'd try the Griffonstone library next. It's a little known secret that if you befriend a librarian, you can usually find out anything. Plus, as a bonus, there's a statue of King Grover outside! [giggles] Photo op! And don't forget to sample some famous griffon scones. They're supposed to be the best.\nPinkie Pie: Aw, Twilight should've come along! Then she could see first-hoof that Griffonstone is...\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: ...a total dump!\n\n[branch creaking]\nRainbow Dash: Ugh. Maybe the map should've called Rarity instead of us.\nPinkie Pie: Excuse me, sir? This is Griffonstone, right?\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: Well, that wasn't very nice.\nRainbow Dash: See? These griffons are exactly like I'd thought they'd be.\nPinkie Pie: Maybe we should just find the palace so we can ask the king what's going on.\nGilda: We don't have a king, losers.\nRainbow Dash: Hello, Gilda.\nGilda: Dash.\nPinkie Pie: Pinkie!\nRainbow Dash: What are you doing here?\nGilda: Uh, I'm a griffon? What's your excuse, dweebs?\nPinkie Pie: Hey! These 'dweebs' are here to help Griffonstone!\nGilda: Help it what?\nPinkie Pie: Well... we're not really sure! But it involves a map and our cutie marks and a problem, and\u2014\nGilda: Bored now!\nPinkie Pie: Well if you don't have a king, could you at least tell us where the Idol of Boreas is?\nGilda: Ha-ha! Don't tell me you really believe in that thing.\nGrampa Gruff: You'd better believe in it! [coughs and wheezes]\n[thump]\n[door opens]\nGrampa Gruff: It was the best thing to ever happen to us griffons!\nGilda: Oh, great. Now you got Grampa Gruff started!\nGrampa Gruff: I'll tell you the whole tragic tale... [laughing] ...for a couple of bits.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs]\n[bits clinking]\nGrampa Gruff: The first griffon king, King Grover, united our kind like we've never been united before or since! And he did it all with that incredible Idol of Boreas.\nPinkie Pie: [stifled giggling]\nGrampa Gruff: That idol brought pride to the heart of every griffon that saw it! From one king to the next, Griffonstone had our golden idol. We were the envy of all other species. [narrating] It held us together \u2013 it gave us an identity \u2013 right up until the reign of King Guto.\n[lightning cracks]\nGrampa Gruff: [narrating] That's when Arimaspi came to steal our griffon treasure! King Guto tried to fight him off, but Arimaspi managed to get away with the idol!\n[lightning cracks]\nArimaspi: [bellows]\nGrampa Gruff: [narrating] They say when our treasure fell into the Abysmal Abyss, our pride went with it. King Guto was the last king of Griffonstone, and we all lived miserably ever after. The end!\nPinkie Pie: [tearing up] That was the saddest story ever!\nGrampa Gruff: Aw, well... Tough tailfeathers! No refunds!\nPinkie Pie: No wonder Twilight's book ended with the coronation of King Guto. Who would want to record a history that sad?\n[thump]\nGilda: It's not sad! Do we look sad to you?\n[thump, scrabbling]\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie, I think I know why the map sent us here. We need to find the Idol of Boreas and bring glory and pride back to Griffonstone!\nGilda: Ha-ha. Here we go \u2013 typical pony hero complex. None of us care about that dumb old idol. Don't you get it? We don't care about anything, and that's the way we like it!\nPinkie Pie: I think Rainbow Dash is right! The map sent us here to fix some sort of problem!\nGilda: The only problem Griffonstone has is you!\nRainbow Dash: Well, I don't care what she says. We're gonna find that treasure, make Griffonstone cool again, and get back to Ponyville! Come on!\nPinkie Pie: Wait, Rainbow Dash. What about Twilight's advice?\nRainbow Dash: What, taking a bunch of pictures?\nPinkie Pie: She mentioned finding answers at the library.\n[thwap]\nRainbow Dash: Knock yourself out. But when you get bored with Twilight's tour book, I'll be at the Abysmal Abyss finding the Idol of Boreas.\n\n[door opening]\nRainbow Dash: I'm here to find your missing idol and save Griffonstone!\n[beat]\n[door breaks]\nRainbow Dash: Uh, I'll need some rope, a grappling hook, and a guide to take me down to the Abysmal Abyss.\nStorekeeper: And I'll need some bits.\n\nPinkie Pie: Hey, Gilda! Word on the street is that Griffonstone has an amazing library chock-full of answers!\nGilda: Word on what street?\nPinkie Pie: Okay, maybe not this street, but on other streets, your library is the talk of the town.\nGilda: The library's right there, so why don't you go inside and leave me alone?!\n[cart rattling]\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] Maybe it's good that Twilight didn't come... [to statue] It's sad what happened to your town, King, but Rainbow Dash can't be right. This can't all be because of a missing hunk of gold. [as King Grover] You are right, Pinkie! And you've got amazing hair! [normal] Aw, King Grover, you old charmer!\n[statue breaks]\n[bonk!]\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] I know what Griffonstone needs!\nGilda: Fewer ponies?\nPinkie Pie: A song! I've got a super song about smiling that sure to make even the most grumpy griffon grin! [inhales]\nGilda: Can't sing here!\nPinkie Pie: But how do you break into uplifting musical numbers with no singing?\nGilda: Yeah, that's Griffonstone's biggest problem \u2013 lack of uplifting musical numbers.\nPinkie Pie: Well if I can't sing, how about a party? If there's one thing these griffons need, it's a good cheer! Where's your party store?\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: No party store? Uh, how about cake? Nothing cheers folks up like cake! Where's a bakery?\nGilda: Ugh.\nPinkie Pie: No singing, no party store, no bakery?! What is this place?!\nGilda: You're welcome to leave [suddenly yelling] at any time!\n[crash]\n[thump]\nPinkie Pie: Well, that just takes the cake. Wait, no! It can't take the cake 'cause there is no cake! Or muffins! Or griffon scones!\nGilda: Oh, we got griffon scones. That's my specialty.\nPinkie Pie: I'll buy one! [chomp]\nGilda: Bits first!\n[bit clinking]\nPinkie Pie: [crunching]\nGilda: Well?\nPinkie Pie: [crunching]\nGilda: What, you like it? That's my Grampa Gruff's secret recipe.\nPinkie Pie: [with mouth full] Ow! I think I broke a tooth!\nGilda: Well, whatever. No refunds. I don't even care anyway. I just want to sell enough of these so that I can leave this lousy town.\nPinkie Pie: [spits] I can help you with that!\n\n[wind blowing]\nRainbow Dash: Uh, you think you could tighten the strap on my helmet?\nStorekeeper: Can you give me more bits?\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Never mind, I got it. So how deep is this abyss?\nStorekeeper: How deep are your pockets?\nRainbow Dash: Don't you griffons ever talk about anything but bits?\nStorekeeper: Gimme some bits and I'll answer.\nRainbow Dash: No wonder Gilda's such a delight.\n\nPinkie Pie: [chewing] Grampa Gruff's recipe is good, but it's missing one important ingredient.\nGilda: Don't tell me. \"Friendship\"?\nPinkie Pie: Uh, no. Baking powder. Lucky for you, I never leave home without it! Now just pop those in the oven, and you'll have griffon scones worth their weight in gold!\nGreta: [sniffing]\n[bonk!]\n[thud]\nGilda: Greta!\nPinkie Pie: Aha! I saw that, Gilda! You may act like a gruff, grumbling griffon, but inside you're gracious and great!\nGilda: What are you talking about?\nPinkie Pie: You just helped your friend up when she got knocked down.\nGilda: What, her? Greta's just some griffon I know. We don't have friends here! [sighs] I did have a friend once, but you saw how that turned out.\nPinkie Pie: [poink!] [slide whistle noise] Oh, my gosh, I gotta go find Rainbow Dash!\nGilda: See ya.\n\n[wind blowing]\nRainbow Dash: [shouting] You sure we can't just fly down? Whoa! Never mind, totally got my answer there.\n\nRainbow Dash: Just gotta find that golden idol and get out of this place.\n[rope snaps]\nRainbow Dash: [screaming] Whoooa!\n[thump]\nRainbow Dash: Ow, ooh! My hoof! Help! Throw me another rope!\nStorekeeper: You got bits?\nRainbow Dash: Wait! Heeeeeelp...! [fades into distance]\n\n[bandage tightening]\n[wind blowing]\n[thump]\nRainbow Dash: [frustrated yell]\nPinkie Pie: [in distance] There you are! Forget about finding the idol! I figured out how to solve Griffonstone's real problem \u2013 scones!\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie Pie, you get back here!\nPinkie Pie: [in distance] Yeah?\nRainbow Dash: [in distance] Can you throw down a rope or something?\nPinkie Pie: [in distance] Lemme look!\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: One rope coming up!\nRainbow Dash: [grumbles]\nPinkie Pie: We need help. Don't go anywhere!\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Where does she think I'm gonna go?\n[rock crumbles]\nRainbow Dash: [panicked noises] I hope I don't go anywhere!\n\n[scones sizzling]\nGilda: [chewing]\nPinkie Pie: Rainbow Dash is stuck on a ledge in the Abysmal Abyss, and I need your help to save her!\nGilda: Not my problem.\nPinkie Pie: Of course it's your problem! She's your friend!\nGilda: Used to be.\nPinkie Pie: Can't you remember when she was?\nGilda: Yeah. Of course.\n\nYoung Hoops: Doesn't that griffon know she's supposed to fly at the Junior Speedsters Flight Camp?\nYoung Rainbow Dash: Maybe she just doesn't want to make you look bad! Hey there, I'm Rainbow Dash! And you are...?\nYoung Gilda: Uh... G-G-G-G-Gilda.\nYoung Rainbow Dash: You sure about that? Stick with me, Gilda, and those guys won't give you any more guff. Whoa! You're awesome!\nYoung Gilda: [laughing] You too, Rainbow Dash!\nYoung Rainbow Dash: Well, Gilda, let's show these guys how it's done!\n[bowling pins clatter]\nYoung Gilda: Junior Speedsters are our lives,\nYoung Rainbow Dash: Skybound soars and daring dives,\nYoung Gilda and Young Rainbow Dash: Junior Speedsters, it's our quest to someday be the very best!\n\nGilda: Fine. I'll help her. But that doesn't make me her friend.\nPinkie Pie: Duly noted. [to the audience] Except it does!\n\n[rock crumbling]\n[wind blowing]\nGilda: Hang on, loser! I'm coming!\nRainbow Dash: What took you so long, doofus?!\n[rock crumbling]\nRainbow Dash: [screaming]\nPinkie Pie: Rainbow Dash! I'm coming for you!\nRainbow Dash: [screaming]\nPinkie Pie: Gotcha!\nGilda, Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash: [screaming]\n[thump]\nPinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash: [grunting]\nGilda: Hold on, you two! [grunting] Huh? [gasps]\n[metallic glint]\nGilda: The Idol of Boreas! [grunting]\nRainbow Dash: I'm slipping!\nGilda: [straining]\nPinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash: [screaming]\nGilda: [grunting]\n[thump]\n[chink!]\nRainbow Dash: The idol!\nGilda: You're more important to me than some dumb chunk of gold.\n[rock crumbling]\nPinkie Pie: Hugging later, climbing now!\n\nGilda: I'm really sorry about how I treated you two.\nRainbow Dash: Thanks, Gilda.\nPinkie Pie: Apology accepted.\nRainbow Dash: And I'm just sorry we didn't get your idol back. Now we'll never be able to solve Griffonstone's problem.\nPinkie Pie: That's what I was trying to tell you! The map didn't send us here to find the lost Idol of Boreas. It sent us here to replace it with something better!\nGilda: Nothing's better than gold to a griffon.\nPinkie Pie: That's because you don't have friendship! If you can learn to care about each other again, Griffonstone could be a mightier kingdom than it ever was before! And you don't need some golden idol to do that. You just need each other.\nRainbow Dash: Whoa, Pinkie. That was... really sappy.\nPinkie Pie: Eh, what can I say? That's how I roll. Go on, Gilda! Go make a friend!\nRainbow Dash: I don't know, Pinkie. You really think these griffons are up for this? We aren't exactly in Ponyville, you know.\nGilda: Okay, so she was really weirded out until I gave her the scone. Then she tried it and said it tasted good! That's the first nice thing anygriffon's ever said to me!\n[cutie marks ringing]\nRainbow Dash: Whoa, Pinkie.

Everywhere I went, they were all gussied up and lookin' at me funny!

[gasps] The invitations are wrong! This says the wedding is today!\nCranky Doodle Donkey: But I got such a good deal on them...\nMatilda: Everypony in town got these! The princesses have even RSVP'd!\nCranky Doodle Donkey: I told you we should have eloped!\nMatilda: Oh, dear. The caterer, the flowers, the musicians! We've got to move it all to today!\nCranky Doodle Donkey: What?!\n[door opens]\nMatilda: Where's my wedding planner?!\n\nCranky Doodle Donkey: You told me you could do it for half what the others charged, and then you sent the invitations to everypony in town with the wrong date! [snorts]\nDerpy: Muffin?\n\n[theme song]\n\nDerpy: I really messed up on those invitations! I feel just awful, Doc!\nSavoir Fare: Hmph! Perhaps that explains why I never got mine!\nDerpy: I told Cranky I could get 'em printed for cheap, but that meant hiring somepony with no experience using a printing press.\n\n[printing press exploding]\n[squirt]\n\nDerpy: Oh, I wish there was a way I could go back in time and fix all this.\nDr. Hooves: [slurping]\n\nDr. Hooves: Going back in time is old thinking, my friend. I was working off a cutting-edge theory of making time come forward to you.\n[clunking]\nDr. Hooves: My life's work, decades \u2013 centuries, really \u2013 of research and experimentation, and I nearly had it cracked! Turns out there's a magic spell for it. Who knew?\n[zap]\n[zap]\nDr. Hooves: But there are so many things that magic can't explain, where science and mathematics are the real magic!\nDerpy: Like these? They're pretty.\nDr. Hooves: Ah, yes, my flameless fireworks. I never could quite figure out how to get them to ignite.\nDerpy: How did you learn to make all this stuff anyway?\nDr. Hooves: I've been studying science my whole life. Ever since a particularly traumatic experience as a foal, I've been looking for ways to make sense of the world around me. Science provides explanations of things we never thought possible! Now, why did we come here again?\nDerpy: Yeah. Oh! Because I accidentally sent out invitations for Cranky and Matilda's wedding with today's date instead of tomorrow's!\nDr. Hooves: Great whickering stallions! I completely forgot! And I still need to get my suit tailored!\n\nDr. Hooves: Rarity? [knocking] Rarity! [grumbling]\n[hip-hop playing in headphones]\nDr. Hooves: [to DJ Pon-3] Please! You've got to help me! I lost track of time, unbelievably, and forgot that the wedding is this afternoon! [completely drowned out by hip-hop] Have you seen Rarity? She's got to alter the sleeves on my suit, and she's got to do it now! Oh, ha-ha, thank goodness. Lead on, my friend.\n\n[bowling strike]\nDr. Hooves: Er, why have you brought me here? Rarity would never set hoof in\u2014\n[suits sparkling]\nDr. Hooves: Great whickering stallions, they've got style! Gentlecolts! I'm facing certain calamity, and I couldn't help noticing your remarkable fashion sense. Could I have the name of your incredible tailor?\nJeff Letrotski: Oh, yeah, man. His name is me.\nDr. Hooves: \"Me\". What an unfortunate name.\nJeff Letrotski: No, man, like, I manufacture all of my own garments. We all do, man.\nDr. Hooves: Then you've got to help me! I need this suit tailored! It's an emergency!\nJeff Letrotski: [laughs] Sorry, man, we're just about to start the finals.\nDr. Hooves: What's this word you keep using \u2013 \"man\"?\nJeff Letrotski: I dunno, man, but guess what? Our fourth didn't show, so if you roll with us, we'll alter your suit for you.\n[scribbling noises]\nDr. Hooves: I'm sorry, gentlecolts, but I will not bowl. The splits, the spares! There are simply too many variables!\nJeff Letrotski: Variables? What are you talking about, man? Just throw the ball straight!\nDr. Hooves: Hold on. Straight?\n[dinging]\n[bowling strike]\nDr. Hooves: Very well. I'll try your \"straight\" technique. It just might be crazy enough to work.\n\nOctavia Melody: Do we know what they're on about?\nApple Bloom: The way they're huddled up like that, I'd say it's either a friendship problem or a monster attack.\nOctavia Melody: A monster attack?! Blast! I'm performing at the ceremony this afternoon, and I still haven't sorted out what to play. How am I meant to practice with a monster invading Ponyville?\nSweetie Belle: Maybe it's just a friendship problem, and it'll all be cleared up in half an hour or so.\nOctavia Melody: [groan] I hope so.\nMatilda: Where's Pinkie Pie?!

You bet I'll\u2014\n[bugbear growling]\nRainbow Dash: Whoa!\n[crash]\nMatilda: Come on! We better get to the salon before that monster flattens it!\n[bugbear roaring]\n\n[bugbear growling]\nDerpy: What am I gonna do? [gasp] Matilda! I feel so bad about the invitations!

A broken stem on one of the zinnias!\nDaisy: Whaaat?!\n[thud]\nRose: Oh, the horror, the horror!\n\nSweetie Drops: I have to admit, when Matilda said we needed this place ready by today, I was a little nervous.\nLyra Heartstrings: With you by my side, I knew we'd get it done in time.\nSweetie Drops: There is nothing like a best friend, is there?\nLyra Heartstrings: Anything's possible when you know somepony as well as we know each other!\n[distant bugbear roaring]\nSweetie Drops: What was that?\nLyra Heartstrings: There's some monster attacking Ponyville or something.\nSweetie Drops: What is it this time? A creature from the Everfree Forest?\nLyra Heartstrings: Uh, I think it's some sort of bugbear. [giggles]\nSweetie Drops: Did you say bugbear? It found me!\nLyra Heartstrings: What are you talking about, Bon Bon?\nSweetie Drops: My name isn't Bon Bon. It's \"Special Agent Sweetie Drops\". I work for a super-secret anti-monster agency in Canterlot, or at least I did until the bugbear went missing from Tartarus a few years back.\nLyra Heartstrings: What are you talking about?\nSweetie Drops: When it escaped, we had to shutter the whole agency. Every last shred of evidence of the organization's existence was destroyed. Celestia demanded complete deniability.\nLyra Heartstrings: ...What?\nSweetie Drops: It was me who captured the bugbear. I had to go deep cover here in Ponyville and assume the name Bon Bon. I never thought it'd be able to track me, but now it has.\nLyra Heartstrings: Are you saying our whole friendship was based on a lie?!\nSweetie Drops: I'm sorry, Lyra! I couldn't tell you for your own protection!\nLyra Heartstrings: B-b-but the lunches! The-the long talks! The benches we sat on! [tearing up] None of that was real?!\nSweetie Drops: It was all real. You're my very best friend.\n[bugbear roaring]\n[window opening]\n[thud]\nSweetie Drops: I've got to go find a crowd to blend into before I put you in danger! I'll see you at the wedding.\nLyra Heartstrings: Fine! But we're going to talk about this later!\nCranky Doodle Donkey: I need my ring today, no matter the cost! ...As long as it doesn't cost any extra.\n\nJeff Letrotski: Seven/ten split, man. Harshest of the harsh. But if you pick this up, we win the whole shebang!\nDr. Hooves: [inhales, exhales]\n[door opens]\nDerpy: Doc! I've finally figured out how I can help! Your flameless fireworks look just like flowers! I'll use them for the wedding!\nDr. Hooves: Great whickering stallions! Wait!\n[pin clattering]\nWalter: [angry grunt]\nDr. Hooves: Wait! The flameless fireworks are extremely volatile! Without knowing what the trigger is, they could go off at any moment! My word, is that a bugbear?\n[bugbear growling]\nMatilda: Oh, there are so many things I'm forgetting! I hope Cranky remembers to tell the musicians! Oh! Oh! I'll never get my mane done in time!\nLotus Blossom: You must relax, my dear! We can handle anything! We once did a pony's hair during the ceremony!\nSteven Magnet: Oh, it's true, it's true! They really are the best! Matilda, I've just got to say, I already feel like we're family.\nMatilda: You do?\nSteven Magnet: Of course! I'm Steven Magnet, Cranky's best beast!\nMatilda: You're Steven Magnet?\nSteven Magnet: Well, what'd you expect, a bugbear? I've known Cranky forev-er! Surely he must have told you about the time he saved me from Flash Freeze Lake?\nMatilda: ...You're Steven Magnet.\nSteven Magnet: Oh, I know, I know! Typical Cranky, to leave out minor details, like the fact that I'm, y'know, a sea monster, right? [laughs] I just love that old burro!\nMatilda: I'm sorry, Steven. I guess I assumed you were a pony. And I had no idea you had such adventures together.\nSteven Magnet: Oh, honey, you don't know the half of it! But let me tell you something. In all that we've been through together, the only thing he ever cared about was finding you.\nMatilda: Really?\nSteven Magnet: Well, that and a baldness cure. [laughs]\nMatilda: He is the sweetest thing, isn't he? All the stress I've put myself through. All the stress I've put him through. The only thing that matters is that we're together. The wedding isn't the important thing \u2013 the marriage is.\nSteven Magnet: [laughing] Oh, goodness gracious. If you believe that, I have got a bridge to sell you! All these ponies traveling to Ponyville, putting on uncomfortable clothes, sitting through a long ceremony, you think any of them care about the marriage? [laughing] Honey, the wedding is everything.\nMatilda: [teeth rattling]\n\nOctavia Melody: [playing Mendelssohn's \"Wedding March\"] Ugh, all these wedding songs are so... standard. I want Matilda and Cranky's wedding to be special. [continues playing cello]\n[cello overlaid with dubstep beats]\nOctavia Melody: Thanks, but I'm not sure that's appropriate for a wedding, is it? [resumes playing]\n[dubstep cello]\nOctavia Melody: [gasps] That's more like it!\n[dubstep cello continues]\n[dubstep cello intensifies]\n[record scratch]\nOctavia Melody: Stop! I'm going to be late for the wedding!\n[dubstep cello continues]\n[bugbear growling]\n[magic zap]\n[dubstep cello continues]\n[thuds under]\n[dink!]\n[music stops abruptly]\nGummy: [narrating] What is life? Is it nothing more than the endless search for a cutie mark? And what is a cutie mark but a constant reminder that we're all only one bugbear attack away from oblivion? And what of the poor gator? Flank forever blank, destined to an existential swim down the river of life to... an unknowable destiny? [licks]\n[series of thuds]\nOctavia Melody: Something like that might work.\n\nPrincess Celestia: [hushed] What do you mean you left it on the counter?!\nPrincess Luna: [hushed] I thought you were bringing it!\nPrincess Celestia: [hushed] [groans] Well, this is just wonderful!\n[beat]\nPrincess Luna: [hushed] I handled the gift for Cadance and Shining Armor! You were supposed to do this one, remember?\nPrincess Celestia: [hushed] Well, we can't just come to this wedding empty-hoofed!\nShining Armor: [sobbing]\nPrincess Cadance: [sighs] It's alright. He always cries at weddings.\nShining Armor: [bawling]\nPrincess Cadance: ...Usually it's not until the wedding starts.\nDerpy: These flameless fireworks look even better than flowers!

They've defeated the bugbear!\n[ponies cheering]\nSweetie Drops: [to Lyra] Hey.\nLyra Heartstrings: Hello.\nSweetie Drops: So, uh, you didn't happen to mention our earlier conversation about my [hushed through gritted teeth] secret identity [normal] to anypony, did you?\nLyra Heartstrings: No. I did not. And you're not the only one with a secret, y'know. You know those expensive imported oats you were saving for a special occasion? I cooked them up and ate them! All of them! [laughs] It's sort of thrilling to reveal your deepest, darkest secrets!\nSweetie Drops: [laughs] That's what best friends are for.\nPrincess Celestia: [hushed] Next time, you can just bring your own gift, and I'll bring mine.\nPrincess Luna: [hushed] Fine.\n[door creaks]\nDr. Hooves: There you are! My suit has vanished and this was the only thing left in my closet! How do I look?\nDerpy: Like a million bits!\nDr. Hooves: Great whickering stallions, look at the time! We'd better get inside. Allons-y!\nCranky Doodle Donkey: I can't believe I lost my hair! I look ridiculous. The love of my life deserves better than this!\nSteven Magnet: Have no fear, Cranky, my dear. It's Steven Magnet's mustache to the rescue!\n[shing]\n[fsst]\nCranky Doodle Donkey: Aw, thanks, buddy.\nSteven Magnet: Oh, no problem. Now you get in there and marry that donkey!\nMayor Mare: Well, is everypony here?\n[door slams, lock clicks]\nDerpy: All set, Mayor!\nMayor Mare: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join these two in mare-trimony. As I look around this room, I can only imagine how uncomfortable Cranky must be.\n[ponies laughing]\nCranky Doodle Donkey: [grumbles]\nMayor Mare: But I also see so many ponies from all trots of life, brought together by love. Cranky searched all across this great land of ours to find Matilda, and no matter what obstacles kept them apart, love would finally bring them together, just as it has brought all of us together now. It's remarkable to me how a story like Cranky's search for Matilda could fill this room with such a unique collection of ponies! It makes you realize that everypony is the star of their own story. And it's not just the main characters in our stories that make life so rich! It's everypony \u2013 those who play big parts and those who play small. If it weren't for everypony in this room and many more who couldn't be here today, Cranky and Matilda's lives wouldn't be as full and vibrant as they are.\nSteven Magnet: [crying]\nBulk Biceps: [squeaks]\nMayor Mare: And so, in front of all these loved ones... Cranky, do you take this donkey to be your lawfully wedded wife?\nCranky Doodle Donkey: You bet I do!\nMayor Mare: And do you, Matilda, take this donkey to be your lawfully wedded husband?\nMatilda: [tearing up] I do!\nMayor Mare: Then I'm proud to say, I now pronounce you jack and jenny!\nCranky Doodle Donkey and Matilda: [kissing]\n[ponies cheering]\n[flameless fireworks exploding]\nDr. Hooves: [laughs] Of course! They need love to ignite! How could I have missed it?!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: You know something, girls? We are so lucky to live in this town. I love you all!\nRainbow Dash: Ow!

It was worth a try though, wasn't it, old chap, hm?\nSpike: This is great! I just took care of a whole bunch of stuff that Twilight won't have to worry about when she wakes up!

Sorry.\nPrincess Cadance: Hey, Spike. What's going on?\nSpike: Oh, you know, just settin' 'em up and knockin' 'em down!\nPrincess Cadance: What do you mean?\nSpike: Not only have I kept things quiet so Twilight could sleep, I also took care of all her afternoon meetings so she won't have to worry about them when she wakes up.\nPrincess Cadance: Are you sure she'd want you doing that? There are so many things to keep track of at this summit.\nSpike: Nah, don't worry. I got it covered. I know Twilight so well, it's easy to make decisions like her!\nPrincess Cadance: Oh, okay.

I'm a great princess\u2014I mean, Twilight's a great princess! And I've been working hard to help her! When two delegates had a falling out, I'm the one who fixed their friendship! I listened to that pony drone on about gems for forty-five minutes so Twilight wouldn't have to! I moved a polo match away from the tower so she could sleep! And I didn't even eat that delicious looking statue! I'm a decision-making master!\n[beat]\nSpike: [sighs] Okay. So maybe I did get a little carried away making decisions. But it's not like anything bad happened.\n[thok]\n[trees falling]\n[water main bursting]\nPrincess Cadance and Spike: [screaming]\nSpike: This is unexpected!\nPrincess Cadance: I'll go shut off the main! You get rid of the water!\n[splashing]\n[crystals growing]\n[door groaning]\n[splash]\nSpike: At least the statue's okay. [sniffles] Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no! [sneezes]\n[gems tinkling]\nSpike: Oh, bless me...\n\n[delegates shouting]\nFancy Pants: Oh, my! What is the meaning of this?!\nSpike: Well, uh, you see, there was this polo game, and\u2014\nFancy Pants: How could you let a water main burst on Canterlot's most important day?!\nPublic Works Pony: Hey, don't look at me! Princess Twilight said to stop working on it!\nFancy Pants: Well, what about these trees?! I ordered them trimmed to avoid just such a situation!\nHorticultural Pegasus: But the princess told me to stop, bub!\nFancy Pants: Why would the princess make such horrible decisions?! This all could have been prevented!\n[delegates shouting]\nSpike: Please, everypony, listen! I'm so sorry all this happened!\nFancy Pants: What are you apologizing for? These were Princess Twilight's awful decisions!\n\"March Gustysnows\": I'm about to blow my stack on Princess Twilight, I'll tell you that for nothin'!\n\"Joe Pescolt\": Yeah, me too!\nFancy Pants: I'll not let Princess Twilight give Canterlot a bad name in the eyes of Equestria! Come on, everypony! Let's go give her a piece of our minds!\n[delegates shouting]\nSpike: Please! You've got it all wrong!\n\n[delegates shouting]\nSpike: [panting] Wait! I mean, [hushed] wait!\nFancy Pants: What is it now?! There's an angry mob here that demands satisfaction!\nSpike: It's just that, uh, we don't want to wake the princess, do we?\n\"Joe Pescolt\": Wake her?! What?! You're tellin' me that she's asleep?!\n[delegates shouting]\n[door opens and shuts]\n[lock clicks]\nSpike: [panting]\nFancy Pants: [muffled] Princess, we must speak at once!\nSpike: She is SLEEPING!\nTwilight Sparkle: [snoring]\nSpike: [sighs]\nTwilight Sparkle: [yawns] I'm glad you're here, Spike. We've got a lot to do! Do you know if the water main was fixed?\nSpike: Uh, you seem well-rested.\nTwilight Sparkle: I haven't slept like that since I was a filly!\nSpike: You haven't? Well, at least I got one thing right. And it was the one thing Cadance asked of me. Maybe I did do a good job today!\n[knocking]\n[doors burst open]\nSpike: [yelps]\n[delegates shouting]\nTwilight Sparkle: Fancy Pants, what's wrong?\nFancy Pants: Don't play games with me, Princess! You know why I'm here!\nTwilight Sparkle: Is this about the special privileges you wanted? Because this seems a little extreme!\nFancy Pants: The special privileges?! The last thing on my mind is special privileges!\nTwilight Sparkle: What's going on, Spike?\nSpike: Um... you needed to sleep. And Princess Cadance told me you weren't to be disturbed. And there was this bird, and, well... long story short, I made a few decisions on your behalf.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: A few decisions?!\nSpike: Well, maybe more than a few, but I had good intentions! Honest! Until I... didn't anymore. I'm sorry, Twilight. I guess I got a little carried away. It-it just felt so good to have ponies caring about my opinions on such important matters. I guess I was just enjoying feeling like a princess.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, Spike, one of the most important things a princess can do is realize when she's made a mistake and fix it.\nSpike: How do I do that?\nPrincess Cadance: You could start with them.\nSpike: [sighs] Uh, hi there, everypony. So I guess I owe you all a pretty big apology. It's funny. Here we are at a summit that brings together ponies from all across Equestria, and all I could think about was myself. You all came here to celebrate the things that make each of our cities so unique and special. But instead of getting into the spirit of things like all of you, I used my friend's position to make myself feel good.\n[gems clinking]\nFancy Pants: The Canterlot ruby goes here, old sport.\n\"March Gustysnows\": And ours goes here, don't'cha know?\n[delegates chattering, gems clinking]\nSpike: Does this mean you forgive me?\n\"Joe Pescolt\": Sure! You know, the whole idea of the statue is that when each of us plays our own small part, it adds up to somethin' great.\nFancy Pants: Quite. Just like how all our cities make up the beautiful land of Equestria!\nPrincess Cadance: I hereby dedicate the Citizens of Equestria statue to everypony who plays their part, no matter how big or how small!\n[delegates cheering]\nSpike: [sniffles] Aw, come on!

Everything's gonna be fine!\nPinkie Pie: Twilight, tell those butterflies in your tummy to beat it! Making new friends is always fun.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ohhhh...\nFluttershy: They're probably just as nervous as you are.\nApplejack: You've been plannin' this shindig for weeks. You know everything about these fellers. It's gonna be dandy.\nTwilight Sparkle: [inhales] [exhales] You're right. Remember, Equestria and Yakyakistan haven't opened their borders for hundreds of moons. In fact, Yakyakistan is so far north of the Crystal Mountains, nopony's even been there! Imagine the look on Princess Celestia's face when she finds out we made friends with a yak prince! [nervous laugh] I'm calm! I'm calm...\nSpike: [blows trumpet]\n[carpet unfurling]\nPrince Rutherford: Ponies! Greetings, ponies!\n[teleporting zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: Prince Rutherford, your Majesty. On behalf of all of us, I welcome you to Equestria.\nPrince Rutherford: Me honored. Yaks hope for great friendship between ponies and yaks. [echoing] Friends for a thousand moons!\nTwilight Sparkle: You must be hungry after a long journey.\n[table scraping]\nTwilight Sparkle: We've prepared a banquet of traditional yak foods.\nPrince Rutherford: If things not perfect, yaks get mad. Yaks always get mad when things not perfect!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gulp]\nPrince Rutherford: [sniffs] [chewing] [spits] This no taste like yak food! Fake pony food make yaks mad!\nPrince Rutherford and Yaks: [roaring]\n[assorted noises of destruction]\nPinkie Pie: Is it okay to be nervous now?\n\n[theme song]\n\n[walls cracking]\nApplejack: Them yaks sure have a funny way of sayin' \"howdy.\"\nRarity: They're different, that's all. Very... different.\nRainbow Dash: I think they broke my record for most stuff broken in under a minute. I mean, they even broke the trophy.\nTwilight Sparkle: All we have to do is show them how great it can be to have friends before Princess Celestia arrives for the friendship party tonight. Now, who read the seven-volume cross-indexed history of Yakyakistan I recommended?\nRainbow Dash: Um... I-I had a thing...\nPinkie Pie: I did, I did! Did you know they live so far north of the Crystal Empire that it's cold all the time? Yaks have yak fur to keep them warm. [squee]\nApplejack: Pretty sure that's what fur's always for, Pinkie Pie.\nPinkie Pie: I know! Yaks are so cool!\n[vase smashing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, can you show them around town? I know you have to plan the friendship party too, but it would really help make them feel welcome.\nPinkie Pie: Don't worry. They'll be in good hooves with me.\nTwilight Sparkle: Remember, we want to make sure Equestria feels like home. That means doing everything we can to make this place feel like Yakyakistan.\nPinkie Pie: No problem!\nTwilight Sparkle: Good. Let's get out there and make some new friends!\nMain cast sans Twilight: [cries of agreement]\n\nApplejack: We know y'all are noble warriors who avoid the so-called finer things, so me and my family would be honored if you rested here in the barn during your visit.\nPinkie Pie: Applejack and I made hay beds like you're used to back in Yakyakistan.\nPrince Rutherford: Hmm... This perfect.\nPinkie Pie: You can snooze here all afternoon, 'cause you're gonna need a lot of energy for my party tonight!\nApplejack: [sighs] That wasn't so hard.\nPrince Rutherford: Wait! This not yak hay!\nPinkie Pie: Well, we didn't have actual hay from Yakyakistan, but we tried our best to make it just like yours.\nPrince Rutherford: Not perfect! Yaks destroy!\nPrince Rutherford and Yaks: [roaring and grunting]\nApplejack: Pinkie Pie, what do we do?!\n\nPinkie Pie: And now, for your entertainment pleasure... Presenting animals, Yakyakistan style!\n[animals chittering]\nPrince Rutherford: Animals cute.\nFluttershy: Oh. Thank goodness.\n[thud]\nPrince Rutherford: Wait. These antlers lie! These not Yakyakistani animals! Yaks smash!\nPrince Rutherford and Yaks: [roaring and grunting]\n[teaware shattering]\nPinkie Pie: Okay, well... There's still other things we can do. I think.\n\nRarity: Yes! These are some of my favorite materials. Very rare, imported from the Crystal Empire to match your northern sensibilities. I hope you'll find them\u2014\nPrince Rutherford and Yaks: [chewing]\nRarity: ...delicious.\nPrince Rutherford and Yaks: [spits]\nPrince Rutherford: This no taste like yak fabric! Yaks destroy!\nPrince Rutherford and Yaks: [roaring and grunting]\nPinkie Pie: Everything's gonna be fine. You'll just... make it up to them. Somehow.\n\n[birds tweeting]\nPinkie Pie: Listen up! Tell your faces to hold onto their frowns, 'cause they're about to get turned upside-down!\nPrince Rutherford: Hold your frown, face!\nPinkie Pie: Hit it, Rainbow Dash!\n[snow booming]\nPinkie Pie: Just like Yakyakistan snow, right? Because snow is snow, no matter where it comes from.\nPrince Rutherford: [slurp] This not yak snow!\nPrince Rutherford and Yaks: [roaring and grunting]\nPinkie Pie: Seriously?! ...Seriously?\n\nApplejack: Y'know... it's goin' okay.\nRarity: Satisfactory, I'd say.\nRainbow Dash: It could be better.\nFluttershy: [whispering] It's not very good.\nPinkie Pie: It's a disaster!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, tonight's Yakyakistan theme party is more important than ever! You'll make them forget all about this afternoon, right? Because if it's not perfect, they're gonna smash everything! And I'm not sure how much more smashing this visit can take!\nPinkie Pie: I definitely will! I think. Maybe...?\nApplejack: You're the best gosh-darn party planner in Equestria.\nRainbow Dash: You'll show 'em a good time!\nFluttershy: You can do it!\nRarity: We have absolute confidence in your abilities, Pinkie Pie.\nPinkie Pie: It's going to be my most happy-tacular party ever! I hope!\nRainbow Dash: Why are your eyes darting around like that?\nPinkie Pie: It's what I do when I'm not nervous! [laughing hysterically]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, I don't know what we'd do without you\u2014\nPinkie Pie: Me either! Gotta go!\n[hoofsteps trailing off]\n\nPinkie Pie: [hyperventilating] Gummy, what am I gonna do? I had all this amazing stuff planned for the party, but they're gonna hate it! There's no way to make Equestria feel like Yakyakistan. They're just too sensitive! Even Fluttershy made them mad! Fluttershy! Oh... I need a new idea, and I need it now. How am I supposed to make this party feel like Yakyakistan without actually going there and bringing something back?!\nGummy: [slurps]\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] Gummy, you're a genius. [kisses]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: And this is Sugarcube Corner. They're working hard to make your traditional Yakyakistan cake.\nPrince Rutherford: Vanilla extract balance very tricky.\nYaks: Uh-huh.\nTwilight Sparkle: Do you mind, um, waiting here for one moment?\n[teleporting zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: How's tonight's party coming? I'm doing what I can, but it's really up to you at this point! ...Pinkie? Where are you?!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [teeth chattering] Did you find her?\nFluttershy: Angel and I searched the forest, but...\nRainbow Dash: Aerial recon turned up nothing either.\nApplejack: I searched the farm inside and out. No Pinkie Pie. But I did find a set of Granny Smith's dentures under the house, so... not a complete loss.\nRarity: She's simply vanished!\nTwilight Sparkle: But the party! It's all we have left! What are we gonna do?!\n[whack]\nGummy: [barfs]\nTwilight Sparkle: [reading] \"Don't worry. I'll be back in time for the party. Love, Pinkie Pie.\" If Pinkie Pie says she'll be back in time for the party, she'll be back. We have to trust her. Right? [nervous laugh] No reason to freak out!\nFluttershy: Don't worry, Twilight.\nApplejack: When it comes to parties, I think she knows what she's doin'.\nTwilight Sparkle: [inhales] [exhales] You're right. Let's just focus on keeping the yaks happy 'til she's back.\nRainbow Dash: Piece o' cake.\nTwilight Sparkle: The cake!\n\nMrs. Cake: One bite, and you'll be transported right back to Yakyakistan. [nervous laugh] I hope.\n[teleporting zap]\nPrince Rutherford: [chewing] Hmm... Ponies too heavy on vanilla extract!\nPrince Rutherford and Yaks: [roaring and grunting]\nTwilight Sparkle: We've never needed a party so badly.\n\nConductor: Next stop, Crystal Empire!\nPinkie Pie: And so my quest begins. I know what you're thinking. \"Why go to Yakyakistan alone, Pinkie Pie?\" Because I'm the party planner. This burden falls on my rump and my rump alone. If I want a great party, I gotta climb the mountains north of the Crystal Empire, find Yakyakistan, and come back with something authentic! Know what I mean?\n[brakes screeching and hissing]\nPinkie Pie: Did we go the wrong way? Where's all the snow? Please tell me this is magical sand-colored snow. [spits] Nope. Sand. Definitely sand.\nConductor: Dodge City. End of the line, I'm afraid. All trains had to stop. Sheep decided to sit on the tracks.\n[sheep baaing]\nPinkie Pie: Curse you, sheep! Thanks for you help, conductor.\n[smack]\nPinkie Pie: Cherry Jubilee!\nCherry Jubilee: Pinkie Pie?! I reckoned I eyeballed you crossin' my way right now.\nPinkie Pie: How are you? You look amazing! I need help.\nCherry Jubilee: I'm dandy as a daffodil and fit as a floribunda. What can I do ya for?\nPinkie Pie: Have you heard of Yakyakistan? Do you have any idea how I can get there?\nCherry Jubilee: Mark your calendar, missy, 'cause this right here's your lucky day! I'm headin' north to the Crystal Empire myself for a delivery. I ought to warn you though \u2013 me and the boys are powerful tired 'cause we was up all night countin' cherries. Hey there! Wake up!\nPinkie Pie: Counting cherries? How many?\nCherry Jubilee: Four hundred and seventeen thousand, two hundred and thirty-four. Yee-haw!\nPinkie Pie: Whoa!\n\nPinkie Pie: And so my quest resumes. As I stare across the endless desert, I tell myself I will soon triumphantly enter the homeland of our noble guests and return with a prize to make the best party they've ever seen. Know what I mean?\nCherry Jubilee: [snoring]\nPinkie Pie: Cherry? Ravine. Ravine!\n[alarm clock ringing]\n[water splashing]\nPinkie Pie: Wake up! Wake up! [grunting] Stooooop!\n[screeching]\n[thuds]\nCherry Jubilee: Huh?! [gasps] Whoa. I was dreamin' about a ravine. Ravine!\nPinkie Pie: That's what I said.\n[rock cracks, snaps]\n\n[piano playing]\nPrince Rutherford and Yaks: [sobbing]\nPrince Rutherford: Music beautiful. Much soul.\nTwilight Sparkle: Phew!\nSpike: [sighs] When Twilight told me to stall\u2014 I-I mean, entertain you, I thought there's no way I could\u2014\n[piano continues playing]\nYaks: Huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike!\nPrince Rutherford: Piano play itself?! Music a lie! [roars]\n[piano smashing]\nPrince Rutherford: We demand party! Party now or yaks no friends!\nTwilight Sparkle: No! Just a little longer!\nPrince Rutherford: No more longer! We leave now! Yak go to train, return with more yaks! We declare war!\nTwilight Sparkle and Spike: [gasps]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: No Pinkie Pie? What's this?!\nApplejack: Heh-heh. We panicked and tried to plan our own party.\nRainbow Dash: It's sort of panic-themed.\nTwilight Sparkle: The yaks are going home! This is awful! I wanted to surprise Princess Celestia. Now the only surprise is that I may have just started a war.\n\n[wind blowing]\nPinkie Pie: There we were, face-to-face with Falling Pony Ravine. Down, down, down! And then, suddenly... Pow! We were rescued mid-air by the Wonderbolts! And then they gave me a ride to Manehattan, I joined a traveling band, we played some shows here and there, got popular, almost made it big until creative differences tore us apart. And that's when I knew I had to get back on with my journey to the Crystal Empire, the gateway to Yakyakistan! And so here I am. It was a major adventure that took most of the afternoon. Know what I mean?\nPrincess Cadance: This is it. The northern boundary of the Crystal Empire. Beyond lies Yakyakistan. Nopony who's attempted this climb has ever returned. Are you sure you have to do this?\nPinkie Pie: I do.\nPrincess Cadance: Good luck, Pinkie Pie.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: How could she be so late to the party? This isn't like her.\nFluttershy: I'm sure she's trying her best.\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie Pie's tougher than she looks.\nTwilight Sparkle: I know you're right, but... I wish she was here. I put too much pressure on her. I let everypony down. And Princess Celestia will be here any minute and see that I haven't made new friends. I've made new enemies. [sighs]\n[gears clicking]\nMain cast sans Pinkie: [screaming]\n\n[snow shuffling]\n[creature roaring]\nPinkie Pie: Hi! My name is Pinkie Pie! I'm looking for Yakyakistan. You know, faraway land, lots of yaks? Maybe you've heard of it?\nMonster: [roaring]\nPinkie Pie: Whoa-ho-ho! Slow down! I can't understand a word you're saying\u2014\nMonster: [growling]\nPinkie Pie: [yelps] There it is! Yakyakistan!\n[sledding]\n[gate opens]\n[snow cracks, breaks]\nPinkie Pie: Noooooooooo...! [fades in and out]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh. Is everypony alright?\nFluttershy: I can't tell if my eyes are open or closed.\nRainbow Dash: I think I can see a little bit.\n[crash]\nRainbow Dash: Gah! Nope.\n[light flickers on]\nMain cast sans Pinkie: Ooooh...\nApplejack: Look at these! Pinkie Pie's made files for everypony in town!\nFluttershy: With exactly what kind of parties we like.\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie Pie has a secret party-planning cave?! How cool is this?!\nFluttershy: [reading] \"Twilight Sparkle likes vanilla ice cream, red balloons, dancing...\"\nTwilight Sparkle: That's right!\nFluttershy: \"But she's afraid of quesadillas.\"\nTwilight Sparkle: No, I'm not! They're just so... [shudders] cheesy.\n\nPinkie Pie: [fading in] ...oooooooo! No! I'm all the way back where I started! Gummy, I was this close to helping Twilight befriend the yaks. Now I've just let everypony down.\n[muffled chatter]\nPinkie Pie: Hmm?\nMain cast sans Pinkie: [talking over each other]\nApplejack: Looky here. It's notes for the party she wants to throw for her folks' fiftieth anniversary. But they ain't nearly that old! Huh. She's already plannin' their one-hundredth too. And their five-hundredth?\nTwilight Sparkle: I had no idea she worked so hard on her parties.\nRainbow Dash: She may be more organized than you, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: Let's not get carried away.\nRarity: I just wish Pinkie Pie were here so we could tell her how much we all appreciate her hard work.\nPinkie Pie: [tearing up] Thank you! Thank you! I love you too! All of you!\nTwilight Sparkle: You're back!\nPinkie Pie: I tried to go to Yakyakistan so I could bring something back for my party. But at the last second, I made a mistake. [sighs] I worked harder on this party than any party ever. But I'm still just a big failure.\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, you're not a failure.\nFluttershy: What matters is how hard you tried.\nRainbow Dash: Who else would've gone all across Equestria to plan one party?\nPinkie Pie: You know... the trip was really hard. But everypony I met along the way was so helpful. I just wish the yaks could see how friendly and wonderful and great Equestria really is! [gasps] I just got the best party idea ever!\nTwilight Sparkle: It's too late. The yaks left on the last train.\nPinkie Pie: Um, no, they didn't. [squeals] Trust me! There are a whole lot of sheep out there!\n[sloop]\nFluttershy: So, um, do we walk back up the slide, or... or what?\n\nPrince Rutherford: Yaks stuck here?! Why trains not work?! [growling]\nPinkie Pie: I never thought I'd say this, but... thank you, sheep! And now, if it's okay with you, it's party time!\nYaks: Ooh.\n\n[ponies chattering]\nPrince Rutherford: [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow, Pinkie. This came together quick, even for you.\nPinkie Pie: What can I say? I'm good at what I do. Prince Rutherford, every time we tried to make something in Equestria feel like Yakyakistan, we couldn't get it right. When I got back from my adventure, I realized something. We shouldn't try to make Equestria feel like your home. We should try to make you feel at home in Equestria. And that means showing you why we love it here, so you'll love it too.\nPrince Rutherford: Pink pony work hard to make yaks feel at home. Now yaks happy. No declare war.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\nPrince Rutherford: Ponies and yaks... friends?\nPinkie Pie: For a thousand moons?\nPrince Rutherford: For a thousand moons!\nMane Six, Princess Celestia, and Yaks: [cheering]\nPrincess Celestia: I am very impressed, princess.\nTwilight Sparkle: Heh. Just doing my best to spread friendship.\nPrincess Celestia: And you did a wonderful job of it. You and your friends.\nPrince Rutherford: Pink pony, you understand yaks now.\nPinkie Pie: Aww, come here, you!\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: [strained] Wow! Too strong! Okay, okay, okay!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[dishes clinking]\nSpike: [sighs] You know the worst thing about you being the Princess of Friendship? The dishes.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks for taking care of that, Spike. After three events in one week, I really needed to relax with a good book.\nSpike: It's kinda funny, isn't it? All these ponies comin' to you for advice about friendship?\nTwilight Sparkle: What's funny about that?\nSpike: You know, 'cause you used to be famous for being such a bad friend.\nTwilight Sparkle: What are you talking about? I had good friends in Canterlot.\nSpike: Come on, Twilight. Look at the wall. D'ya see any photos from before we moved to Ponyville? And look at you now \u2013 the Princess of Friendship.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] This is a disaster! All my old friends! I can't remember any of their names right now! But do you really think that they think I'm a bad friend?!\nSpike: Well, I only meant that you've come so far. You're a great friend now and\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, I feel terrible! I've gotta make it up to them! Pack a bag, Spike! We're going to Canterlot! And make a list of my friends' names.\nSpike: Aw. Me and my big mouth.\n\n[theme song]\n\nSpike: Come on, Twilight. You're getting worked up about nothin'.\nTwilight Sparkle: The only logical place to start is at the beginning.\n[doors open]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. It's exactly how we left it! [blows] Look! It's Predictions and Prophecies! And it's still open to the Elements of Harmony!\nSpike: And here's that present I was gonna give Moon Dancer! Huh. Guess she won't be needing that. Hey, look! The rest of it's still here!\nTwilight Sparkle: How could I have let this happen?\nSpike: Come on, Twilight. Princess Celestia gave you an assignment. Nopony could blame you for that.\nTwilight Sparkle: But look at the way I left this place. It's a total mess! Just like how I left my friendships.\n[window squeaks]\nTwilight Sparkle: I've gotta make it up toooo... uh...\nSpike: Oh! Uh, Minuette, Twinkleshine, Lemon Hearts, Lyra Heartstrings, and Moon Dancer.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah. Them.\n\nSpike: [snoring]\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike! Come on! We've got work to do!\nSpike: [groans] Have you been awake all night?\nTwilight Sparkle: I did a little research, and I think I know where we can find Minuette! That is one of my friends, right?\n\n[knock on door]\nSpike: Uh, it's not too late to forget I opened my big mouth.\nTwilight Sparkle: No, Spike, I'm glad you opened your big mouth. These ponies have probably been suffering ever since I left. Wondering why their supposed friend would treat them so badly!\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: Minuette?\nMinuette: Twilight Sparkle! [laughs] You old so-and-so! What are you doing here?! Hey, Spike! Look at these wings, huh?! [giggles] Hey, grab a picture of me and the princess, will ya?! I tried to tell my co-workers we used to be friends back when. [giggles] But they've never believed me!\n[lens focusing]\nMinuette: Wait-wait-wait! Really fluff 'em up, huh? [giggles]\n[flash developing]\n[snap]\nMinuette: So what are you doing here? I mean, I know you're here all the time, but you never come to see me. Hey! I just had the greatest idea! You wanna go see Lemon Hearts and Twinkleshine?\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course! My old friends!\nMinuette: It'll be great! [giggles] Come on! Let's fly! Get it? [laughs]\nTwilight Sparkle: This is perfect! I can apologize to all three of them at once!\nSpike: Let's hope they're not as traumatized as Minuette.\n\nTwilight Sparkle, Twinkleshine, Minuette and Lemon Hearts: [giggling]\nMinuette: She did! Twinkleshine literally spit out her oats when she heard you were the Princess of Friendship!\nTwinkleshine: We saw you at the coronation. That was some shindig!\nTwilight Sparkle: You did?\nTwinkleshine: Sure! We see you all the time!\nMinuette: You remember our old friend, Lyra, right? [giggles] She lives in Ponyville too. We're always over there visiting her. Or she's coming over here! [giggles] We've thought about asking you to join us from time to time, but we just sorta figured you'd moved on.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh.\n[beat]\nLemon Hearts: [clears throat] So what brings you by anyway? All those times you've come back to Canterlot, you never had donuts with us before.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, uh, you see... [sighs] I came to apologize.\nMinuette: [gulps] For what?\nTwilight Sparkle: Before I left Canterlot, I didn't really appreciate my friends. And that's because I didn't know how important friendship was. But I've learned so much since I moved to Ponyville. I learned what it means to be a good friend and that I certainly wasn't one to the three of you. So for all the pain I caused you, I am truly sorry.\nTwinkleshine, Minuette and Lemon Hearts: [giggling]\nMinuette: Oh, come on, Twilight! Sure, it might've stung a little bit when you ran off to Ponyville without saying goodbye, but it's not like we weren't used to that from you!\nTwinkleshine: Yeah, we didn't take it personally.\nLemon Hearts: But it's really good to see you now. Hey! Anypony up for a blast from the past?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] It's our old science lab! I have so many great memories of this place!\nMinuette: [giggles] Remember when Lemon Hearts got her head stuck in that beaker?\nTwinkleshine\u00a0and\u00a0Minuette: [giggling]\n[fillies giggling]\nYoung Twilight Sparkle: But according to this book, you're supposed to add the sodium chloride first.\nYoung Moon Dancer: I read ahead, and to make a proper salt lick, you need to add the molasses first.\nYoung Twilight Sparkle: Well, I read ahead too, Moon Dancer, and I'm sure it said sodium chloride first.\nYoung Moon Dancer: [dryly] Oh. I've got the wrong book. That's so hilarious.\nTwinkleshine, Minuette and Lemon Hearts: [giggling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Whatever happened to Moon Dancer?\nLemon Hearts: Moon Dancer?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah, you know, our other friend.\nTwinkleshine: Oh, right! Moon Dancer! I remember her!\nLemon Hearts: I wonder what she's up to.\nMinuette: Yeah, I always liked her. We just sort of lost touch after you left.\nTwinkleshine: I think she went to live out by the stadium, didn't she?\nLemon Hearts: Well, let's go see.\n\nMinuette: I think this is the place. Didn't used to look like this, though.\nTwilight Sparkle: [knocks on door]\n[door breaks]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\n[door creaks]\nTwilight Sparkle: Moon Dancer?\nMoon Dancer: What do you want? I'm trying to study.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's us! Your old friends!\nMoon Dancer: Ugh!\n[door slams]\nMinuette: [nervous chuckle] That's old Moon Dancer, all right. She always did like her books. Hey! Kinda like you used to be, huh? [giggles]\nTwilight Sparkle: Exactly how I used to be.\n\nSpike: [sighs] Come on, Twilight! We've been watching her for three days! Library, house, library, house. That's it!\nTwilight Sparkle: Nopony looks at her or says hello or even gives her a smile. It's like she doesn't even exist. Was she always like this?\nMinuette: Well, she always was a little shy. But for a while there, she was really starting to come out of her shell. Remember when she threw that party? Oh, right. I think you might've been busy that day.\n\nTwinkleshine: [flashback] There you are, Twilight! Moon Dancer is having a little get-together in the west castle courtyard. You wanna come?\nTwilight Sparkle: [flashback] Oh, sorry, girls... I've got a lot of studying to catch up on.\n\nMinuette: Thought she finally might be letting her guard down a little with that party. We invited her out a few times after that. But she was always too busy studying. So, eventually, we just stopped asking.\nTwilight Sparkle: I had no idea that party was so important to her. I've gotta find a way to make it up to her!\n\n[door opens]\n[door closes]\n[quill writing]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] [feigned surprise] Oh, my gosh! Moon Dancer?! Is that\u2014\nPonies: Shh!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Moon Dancer, can I talk to you for a min\u2014\nMoon Dancer: Shh! What is this?\nTwilight Sparkle: Eh, a bubble of silence. I haven't seen you in a while and I thought it might be nice to catch up.\nMoon Dancer: For what purpose?\nTwilight Sparkle: You know, 'cause we're friends.\n[bubble pops]\nPonies: Shhh!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm really sorry to bother you. I was just hoping we would go outside and talk for a bit.\n\n[page turning]\nTwilight Sparkle: [whispering] I'm sorry I skipped your party.\nMoon Dancer: [screams]\n[book closes]\nPonies: [Shhh! Quiet!]\nMoon Dancer: [growls] [whispering] Why won't you leave me alone? I'm trying to study! You've got the wrong pony! I don't have parties!\nTwilight Sparkle: [whispering] You did once. And I was so caught up in my own studying that I didn't take your feelings into account.\nMoon Dancer: [whispering] Look, Twilight Twinkle\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: [whispering] Sparkle.\nMoon Dancer: [whispering] Whatever! I just need to be alone so I can study without some crazy pony trying to make friends, all right?!\nTwilight Sparkle: [whispering] Fine!\nMoon Dancer: [whispering] Wait. How did you get into my book like that?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I've been studying a new studying technique. I can only do it for a few minutes, but you'd be amazed how much you can pick up when you're actually in a book!\nMoon Dancer: It's one of Hayscartes' methods.\nTwilight Sparkle: You know Hayscartes?\nMoon Dancer: Of course! He's a genius!\nTwilight Sparkle: I have a copy of his Treatise on Ponies, you know.\nMoon Dancer: [gasps]\n\nMoon Dancer: What is this place?\nTwilight Sparkle: This is where I used to live. You mean, I never had you over?\nMoon Dancer: Wow! A first edition of Principles of Magic! Hey, didn't I give this to you?\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe?\nMoon Dancer: I did! Look, I even wrote something! \"To my friend, Twilight Sparkle. Thanks for introducing me to the classics.\" I can see by the fact that you left it here that it meant a lot to you.\nTwilight Sparkle: Look, I didn't bring you over here for even more poignant reminders of what a bad friend I was. I brought you here to give you this. You can come here whenever you want and study to your heart's content.\nMoon Dancer: Really?\nTwilight Sparkle: But first, you've gotta do something for me.\nMoon Dancer: What?\nTwilight Sparkle: Have dinner with our old friends tonight.\nMoon Dancer: I can't. I'm reorganizing my biology scrolls.\nTwilight Sparkle: I've been spending a lot of time with Minuette, Twinkleshine, and Lemon Hearts since I've been back. They really miss you.\nMoon Dancer: Look! I already told you! The last thing I need is a bunch of ridiculous friend-making keeping me from studying!\nTwilight Sparkle: Moon Dancer, wait! A wise pony once taught me that there's more to life than dusty old books!\nMoon Dancer: I tried friendship and it's just not for me. Now, if you'll excuse me...\nTwilight Sparkle: What if I taught you Hayscartes' method?\n\nMinuette: So, uh, what are you studying these days?\nMoon Dancer: Science, magic, history, economics, pottery. Things like that.\nMinuette: Yowza! [chuckles] You planning on being a professor or something?\nMoon Dancer: No.\nMinuette: So you're just... studying.\nMoon Dancer: Can I go now?\nTwilight Sparkle: Moon Dancer, please.\nMinuette: It's all right, Twilight. We're having a good time. Right, everypony?\nTwinkleshine and Lemon Hearts: [unsure sounds]\nMinuette: So, uh... Spike, tell Moon Dancer that story 'bout how Twilight had to read a book about doing a sleepover!\nSpike: [inhales]\nMoon Dancer: Slumber 101? I've read that.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh! [chuckles] Really? Well, uh, did you know Lemon Hearts here works at the Canterlot palace?\nLemon Hearts: Uh, yeah. It's true. I do the big events mostly. State dinners, that sort of thing.\nAll but Moon Dancer: [awkward noises]\nMoon Dancer: Ugh!\n\n[teleportation zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: Moon Dancer! [teleportation zap] You've gotta give friendship a chance!\nMoon Dancer: Dah! I gave friendship a chance a long time ago! It didn't work out then \u2013 it isn't gonna work out now!\nSpike: Twilight, are you all right?\nTwilight Sparkle: No. No, I'm not.\nSpike: W-Where are you goin'?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know, Spike. I really messed this one up. That party was everything to her. I can only imagine what it must've felt like when I didn't show up.\n\nMinuette: [flashback] Hey, Moon Dancer! Look at this spread, huh?\nMoon Dancer: [flashback] Thank you so much for coming!\nTwinkleshine: [flashback] Of course. We wouldn't miss one of our best friends' parties.\nMoon Dancer: [flashback] Is Twilight coming?\n[beat]\nMoon Dancer: [flashback] Oh. Okay.\nMinuette: [flashback] Hey, we'll still have fun, right? [nervous chuckle]\nMoon Dancer: [flashback] Sure...\n\nTwilight Sparkle: If there was only a way to undo the damage... I know what I need to do. And I know just who can help me.\n\nMinuette: [knocks on door] Huh. Guess they must've gone back to Ponyville.\nPinkie Pie: Wheeeeeeeee!\nMinuette: Huh?\nPinkie Pie: [laughing] Whoooooaaa!\n[crash]\nPinkie Pie: That was awesome! We gotta go flying more often, Twilight!\nMinuette: There you are! [laughs] I thought you threw in the old towel and headed home!\nTwilight Sparkle: I did head home. But not to throw in the towel. I went to get my secret weapon. Minuette, meet\u2014\nMinuette: Hey! Pinkie Pie!\nPinkie Pie: Hi, Minuette! Twilight, you didn't say Minuette would be here!\nTwilight Sparkle: You two know each other?\nPinkie Pie: Oh, sure! She was one of Cadance's bridesmaids! We hang out all the time when she's in Ponyville! Didn't you know that? Ha! And you call yourself the Princess of Friendship! Twilight briefed me on the way here. We'll need fifteen bags of confetti and as many hooves as we can get.\nMinuette: Let's go! We can pass by the donut place on the way!\nSpike: And what are we gonna do?\nTwilight Sparkle: Just come with me.\n\nMoon Dancer: Ooh! A Brief History of the Wagon Harness! Huh? The Life and Times of Morari the Maneless?\n\nMoon Dancer: [gasps]\n[books thudding]\nMoon Dancer: What is this?\nTwilight Sparkle: It's a party. For you.\nPinkie Pie: Surprise!\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on in!\nMoon Dancer: Thanks but no thanks. I don't do parties.\n[teleportation zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: I know. And I think it's my fault. Back when we were in school together, you invited me to a party. I was so focused on my studies that I didn't show up.\nMoon Dancer: Big deal!\nTwilight Sparkle: It was a big deal. And now that I realize how important friendship is, I'd like to make up for my mistake with a new party. A party in honor of my friend Moon Dancer! Please, you've got to let me make this up to you.\nMoon Dancer: And you think this is gonna do it, huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, yes?\nMoon Dancer: Well, sure, why wouldn't it? That was only the first time I put myself out there, and then you didn't even bother to show up! Then you left town without saying goodbye even though we were supposed to be friends! I was humiliated! I felt like I wasn't important! I never wanted to let myself be hurt like that again! Those three finally convinced me that I had value! That other ponies might like me and want to be my friend! And you! Didn't! Show! Up! [screams, sobs]\nPinkie Pie: [whispers to Spike]\nTwilight Sparkle: You're right. This party can't make up for the way I hurt you. But please, don't let my mistake be the reason you can't be friends with anypony else.\nMinuette: We were your friends then and we'd be honored to be your friends now.\nMoon Dancer: [sobs, sniffles] What? That's the librarian! The bookseller! My sister!\nMinuette: You've got a lot of friends, Moon Dancer.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sorry, Moon Dancer. I've faced magical creatures, the end of Equestria, all sorts of things. But seeing how my actions affected you, that was one of the worst feelings I've ever had.\nMoon Dancer: [sobs] Thank you, Twilight. I never realized how much I needed to hear that. Now come on, everypony! Let's party! Right?\nPinkie Pie: Right!\n[party cannon squeak]\nAll: YAAAAAAY!!!\n\n[polka]\n[ponies chattering]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I think it's time for us to go, Moon Dancer.\nMoon Dancer: Thank you for helping me make some new friends. Even if they are my old friends.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. We'll come back and visit soon.\nMoon Dancer: That would be great! You've still gotta teach me that Hayscartes technique!\nTwilight Sparkle: Deal.\nSpike: Um, Moon Dancer? It got kinda banged up, but here's a little something I wanted to give you back at your first party.\n\nMoon Dancer, Minuette, Lemon Hearts, and Twinkleshine: [chattering and shouting]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[hooves galloping]\nPrincess Luna: Greetings, Tantabus. I am ready. Do your worst. [grunting]\nMane Six: [gasps]\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Luna's turning into Nightmare Moon again!\nNightmare Moon: [evil laughter]\nRainbow Dash: Yeah? Well, we've got the cure for that!\n[magic zaps]\nNightmare Moon: [evil laughter] Wait! What is it doing?! No! It's gone! [grunting]\nMane Six: [cheering]\n\nPrincess Luna: [gasps] What? My dream ended... happily? That. Cannot. Happen!\n\n[theme song]\n\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, this is amazing!\nRainbow Dash: [yawns] [tired throughout] Yeah, Rarity. Thanks for setting all this up.\nFluttershy: [tired throughout] A grooming day for our pets really was a great idea.\nOpalescence: [yowls]\nRarity: [tired throughout] Oh, my! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get my normal beauty sleep last night...\nOpalescence: [hisses]\nTwilight Sparkle: [tired throughout] You know... [yawns] I didn't sleep well either.\nApplejack: [tired throughout] Mm-hmm.\nRainbow Dash: Uh-huh.\nPinkie Pie: I'm totally beat too!\nWinona: [barks]\nApplejack: All right, Winona. Time for your brushin'.\nGummy: [squeaks]\n[splash]\nApplejack: Oops. I guess I'm too plumb tuckered out to do this right.\nFluttershy: [yawns] I even went to bed early last night... but then I had a really scary nightmare.\nRest of Mane Six: Me too!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, only, you know, I didn't think mine was that scary!\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, mine sure was. There was this blue smoke monster and... what?\nFluttershy: I dreamt about a blue smoke thingy too!\nApplejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity: Me too!\nRainbow Dash: So what? Probably just a coincidence.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's an awfully big coincidence.\nSpike: Huh. I wonder why I didn't have that nightmare. I slept great!\nRarity: So then, what could've given us all the same nightmare?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know, but I do know who might. Spike, could you send a scroll to Princess Luna?\nSpike: Sure! All set!\nTwilight Sparkle: Dear Princess Luna, last night my friends and I all dreamt of a creature made of blue smoke. I'm sure you're very busy, but [yawns] when you have the chance, please let me know if you have any idea what it could mean. Yours, [yawns] Princess Twilight Sparkle. You can leave out the yawns.\n[scroll rustling]\nSpike: [blows fire]\n[bang]\nPrincess Luna: Which of you saw the creature of blue smoke in your nightmare?!\nFluttershy: Wow. That was fast.\nTwilight Sparkle: We all did.\nSpike: Not me!\nApplejack, Rainbow Dash and Rarity: [simultaneously] Ugh, we know!\nTwilight Sparkle: So you've encountered the smoke monster too?\nPrincess Luna: The Tantabus is a creature of my nightmares. It escaped from my slumbers yesterday.\nFluttershy: But how did it get into ours?\nPrincess Luna: The Tantabus is like a parasite. My dreams must no longer be enough for it. Now it seeks others to infect and corrupt. It must have learned of you six from seeing you in my dream.\nSpike: Whoa-whoa-whoa. So what you're saying is... you dreamt about all of them, and not me? [whimpers]\nRainbow Dash: Uh, so Smokey gave us bad dreams. No biggie.\nPrincess Luna: I saw that the Tantabus had grown more powerful, but I did not realize that power was enough to enable it to escape my dreams. If its power grows, it could very well find a way to escape into the real world. It could turn all of Equestria into a living nightmare!\nRainbow Dash: Okay, okay, okay, I take it back! That does sound bad! Really bad!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: We've prepared everything exactly as you requested.\nPrincess Luna: Good. As you six slumber here, I will pursue the creature into whichever of your dreams it infests.\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! It'll be like a princess sleepover!\nTwilight Sparkle: Speaking of princesses, aren't you gonna ask Celestia for her help as well?\nPrincess Luna: There is nothing my sister can do. She has no power in the realm of sleep. Only I can move from dream to dream. I am afraid nopony can help me tonight.\nApplejack: Even us?\nPrincess Luna: Especially you. You have all suffered so much because of me. You need only slumber while I hunt the Tantabus in your dreams.\nSpike: I know you said nopony can help, but I'm no pony! I'm gonna stay up and watch over you guys just in case!\nTwilight Sparkle: Aw, thank you, Spike!\nApplejack: [yawns] One good thing about not sleepin' well last night \u2013 shouldn't be too hard to fall asleep now.\nPinkie Pie: Are you kidding?! This is so exciting, I don't know how I'm ever going to\u2014 [snores loudly]\nRest of Mane Six: [sleeping noises]\n[magic noises]\n\nRarity: Oh, my! [gasps] This is simply divine!

What kind of monster would do this?!\nPrincess Luna: The Tantabus.\nRarity: Then let's stop it!\nPrincess Luna: No, please! I don't want you to suffer anymore because of me. I will catch it.\n[dresses roaring]\n[magic zaps]\n[bricks laying]\nPrincess Luna: It has jumped into another dream! I am sorry, but if I am to stop it, I must follow it where you cannot.\nRarity: Go! I should be able to handle things here. [gulps] I hope...!\n\nPinkie Pie: La-la-la-la-la! Whee! Whee, ha-ha!\n[dragon roaring]\nPinkie Pie: La-la-la-la-la!\nPrincess Luna: I followed the Tantabus here. Now I need only find\u2014\nPinkie Pie: Sorry, can't help it!

Are you guys okay?\nFluttershy: That... that was terrible! I-I never want to have that nightmare again!\nRainbow Dash: [shivers] Me either!\nSpike: But Luna caught it, didn't she?\nPrincess Luna: I am so sorry, my friends. I failed. It will be back to infect your dreams the next time you sleep.\nFluttershy: Oh, no!\nApplejack: Yeah. I reckon I could live without seeing that thing ever again.\nPrincess Luna: But you will. Again and again, every night, until it grows powerful enough to infect the waking world! After what I did as Nightmare Moon, the fact that I am once again responsible for harming others is more than I can bear.\nPinkie Pie: It'll be okay! Everypony makes mistakes!\nPrincess Luna: As long as none of you dreamt about another pony, the Tantabus remains confined to your dreams. I still have a chance to catch it before it's too late.\nPinkie Pie: Phew, that's good to hear! Although after you left, I did happen to dream that I was eating a giant ice-cream cone with all of Ponyville while taking a test we hadn't studied for. See, what'd I tell ya? Everypony makes mistakes!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: But that means the Tantabus could be turning every dream in Ponyville into a nightmare!\nPrincess Luna: It is far worse than that. Infecting all those dreams gives it more and more power. Soon it will be able to escape into the real world and infect Equestria with its nightmare plague!\nRarity: Then you must let us help you stop it before that happens!\nFluttershy: But how? The Tantabus was able to escape Luna when it only had six dreams it could get to!\nPrincess Luna: It is true. With so many dreams to hide in, I do not know how I can catch it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmm... What if everypony in Ponyville were having one dream?\nPrincess Luna: I... can create shared dreams, yes, but for so many ponies at once? I have never done anything like that. The amount of power it would take...\nFluttershy: Well, it is worth a try, isn't it?\nPrincess Luna: Of course. I will do anything to end this, including accept your help. I cannot allow the Tantabus to escape into the real world. All of you must now go back to sleep and hope that I can create such a dream.\nSpike: [snoring]\n[magic zaps]\n\n[muffin squawks]\nDerpy: [meows]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Princess Luna did it!\nApplejack: [shivers] Big Mac!

There is something coming, something terrible! No, it is already here!\n[Tantabus growling]\n[ponies screaming]\nPrincess Luna: I am so sorry! I brought this upon you! But I will end it now!\n[Tantabus noises]\n[ponies screaming]\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess, what's wrong?\nPrincess Luna: [grunts] It... is taking all my strength just to hold this massive dream together! You will have to stop it! I truly wish I did not have to ask this of you!\nTwilight Sparkle: Then you're in luck.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! We're already on it!\n[house roaring]\nFilthy Rich: [yelping] Please! I'll pay you anything!\n[house roars]\nRainbow Dash: [kiai]\n[kick]\nRainbow Dash: I got you!\n[ponies screaming]\n[magic zap]\nMane Moon: [straining]\n[chomp]\n[house howling]\n[plant hissing]\nApplejack: Oh, no!\n[muffin clucks]\nApplejack: Big Mac! You can do anythin' in a dream, remember?\n[magic shimmering]\nBig McIntosh: Wheeeeee! [giggling]\nRainbow Dash: Come on! If that Tantabus thing turns any more of this dream against us, we'll be too busy saving ponies to catch it! And it'll grow powerful enough to escape into the real world!\n[muffin clucks]\nApplejack: How are we even gonna know when it's able to escape?\nRainbow Dash: Oh, I think we'll know.\n[magic zaps]\n[Tantabus growling]\nPrincess Luna: [straining] Hurry, my friends!\n[zap]\nRainbow Dash: What the?!\nFluttershy: Please, we need your help too!\n[magic zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy's right! We've all got to work together to stop it from escaping!\nMr. Cake: But how can we help? Nopony in Ponyville has your magic or your speed!\nRainbow Dash: That's true... in Ponyville!\nApplejack: But this here isn't Ponyville! It's a dream!\n[muffins squawking]\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\nTwilight Sparkle: And not just any! This is your dream! Anything you can do in your dreams, you can do now!\nSpike: [clicks fingers] Well, if you're gonna dream, might as well dream big, right? Hi-yah!\nDerpy: [meows]\n[ponies cheering]\n[shwing]\n[bits clinking]\n[wings flapping]\n[wind noises]\nRainbow Dash: It's working!\nTwilight Sparkle: But it's not enough!\n[Tantabus roaring]\nPinkie Pie: Then do more! This is a dream, remember?\n[books chittering]\n[thumping]\nPrincess Luna: [straining] I cannot hold this dream together much longer! Equestria will fall because of me!\n[Tantabus roaring]\nSpike: Am I crazy, or did it just get even bigger after Luna said that?\nTwilight Sparkle: I think it's feeding off your guilt, Princess Luna!\nPrincess Luna: If that is so, then perhaps that is how it grew strong enough to escape in the first place!\nApplejack: Say what now?!\nPrincess Luna: I created the Tantabus to give myself the same nightmare every night... [pants] ...to punish myself for the evil I caused as Nightmare Moon!\nFluttershy: But why would you do that?!\nPrincess Luna: To make sure I never forgave myself for how much Equestria suffered because of me! But it seems I have not learned my lesson, for now I have only made you suffer more!\nTwilight Sparkle: But that means you might just be the key to stopping all this!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! If it gets strong because you feel bad about what you did as Nightmare Moon, then you just gotta stop feeling bad for what you did!\nPrincess Luna: How can I forgive myself? I am no better now than I was then. My creation is about to turn the world into a living nightmare!\nTwilight Sparkle: But look at what you're doing! Nightmare Moon would've wanted the Tantabus to turn Equestria into a nightmare! You're doing everything you can to stop it! Don't you see? That proves you're not the same pony you were then! Everypony who knows you knows that Nightmare Moon is in the past! We all trust you, Luna! Do you trust us enough to believe we're right?\n[Tantabus growling]\nPrincess Luna: ...I do!\n[Tantabus noises]\nPrincess Luna: Thank you. Thank you all.\n\n[rooster crowing]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Luna did it!\nRainbow Dash: [yawns]\nApplejack: She sure did! Only... I'm not exactly sure what she did.\nTwilight Sparkle: Luna created the Tantabus to punish herself! The worse she felt, the more power it had! But once she finally forgave herself for what Nightmare Moon did...\nSpike: Poof!\nFluttershy: Shh!\nSpike: Huh.

And while I do agree that this dress has potential, I've not had enough time to give it enough love to become couture.\n[door shuts]\nRarity: But the rest of the gowns in tonight's line have met Rarity's Rules and are ready to be presented!\nSassy Saddles: My marketing research also confirmed that customers that viewed somepony famous wearing a gown wish to own that gown for themselves. I call this piece of the pattern Celebrity Status!\nRarity: So, Twilight, we were wondering if perhaps you might possibly wear this tonight?\nTwilight Sparkle: If being a princess and wearing that dress can help your boutique in any way, then I say stick a pin in it. It's done.\nSassy Saddles: Alright, everypony! Let's set the stage!\nRarity: Ever since I was a little filly, all I've ever wanted was to own a boutique here in Canterlot. Somepony pinch me! I'm about to open the doors to that very boutique!\n[door opens]\nSassy Saddles: Welcome to the grand opening of Canterlot Carousel!\n[crowd cheers]\n\nSassy Saddles: Oh, hello! Oh, nice to see you! Welcome, welcome! Oh, I'm so happy to... [fades out]\nApplejack: That Sassy totally stepped on your hooves, Rarity.\nPinkie Pie: Oh, no! Did she mess up that nice pony pedi?! [sighs] Okay. Phew!\nRarity: Oh, I don't think she meant to.\nSassy Saddles: Rarity, are you ready to reveal the collection?\nApplejack: [under her breath] Is she sure she doesn't wanna do it herself?\nRainbow Dash: [snorts] [under her breath] Yeah.\nRarity: Yes, I am. Fluttershy, could you help Twilight get ready?\nFluttershy: Oh, certainly.\n[customers chattering]\nRarity: Fillies and gentlecolts! I am designer and couturier Rarity, I'd like to welcome you\u2014again [laughs nervously]\u2014to the grand opening of Canterlot Carousel, and I'm thrilled that you are here to see my newest collection inspired by this regal city!\n[crowd oohs]\n[camera clicking]\n[BGM starts]\nFashion Plate: Rarity, I'm\u2014\nRarity: Fashion Plate of Cosmare magazine! I'm so honored that Cosmare was able to do a piece on the grand opening of my boutique!\nFashion Plate: Well, when Sassy Saddles calls, saying she's found the latest and greatest in fashion, we hightail without fail! Now tell me all about your latest collection!\nRarity: Oh, uh, it's called \"Rarity's Royal Regalia\".\nFashion Plate: [gasps] Royally radiant!\nRarity: My favorite part of being a designer is finding my inspiration, and that really wasn't difficult when it came to Canterlot. Everywhere I looked, the royal city just spoke to me! I call it \"In-spire-ation\".\n[crowd oohs]\nFashion Plate: Genius! Simply genius!\nRarity: I spent hours by the lily pond on the castle grounds, which inspired this gown\u2014\"Water Filly\"!\n[crowd oohs]\nFashion Plate: Oh, the whimsy!\nRarity: Watching Celestia raise the sun each morning literally lit up my day... [beat] This is \"Tripping the Light\".\n[crowd oohs]\nFashion Plate: Fantastic!\nRarity: [giggles] And of course, Luna raising the moon guided me to sleep. I call this \"Over the Moon\"!\n[crowd oohs]\nFashion Plate: Well, I certainly am!\nRarity: And for our finale, I have something very special. I was inspired by the stained glass window created in honor of Princess Twilight... I call this \"The Reign in Stain\"!\nFashion Plate: Because the dress is inspired by the\u2014\nFashion Plate and Rarity: \u2014stained glass window of a reigning princess!\nRarity: Yes!\nSassy Saddles: Oh, well, I think \"The Reign in Stain\" is too difficult to explain! [short laugh] Especially for the signature piece of a collection?\nRarity: But I rather like the\u2014\nSassy Saddles: Fillies and gentlecolts, I, Sassy Saddles, am pleased to introduce the grand finale of the grand opening of Rarity's Royal Regalia \u2013 the \"Princess Dress\"!\nFashion Plate: [gasps] Success!\n[crowd oohing and chattering]\nSassy Saddles: Everypony, please follow me and you can all place your orders for the Princess Dress!\n[crowd chattering]\nFashion Plate: Rarity, I want to be the first pony to congratulate you! The Princess Dress has just guaranteed Canterlot Carousel's success! [gasps]\n[crowd chattering]\nMain cast sans Rarity and Twilight: [various congratulations]\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah! Rarity's Royal Regalia is amazing! And everypony seemed to love the Princess Dress!\nSassy Saddles: You bet your saddle they did. Rarity now has one hundred orders for her signature gown!\nRarity: [stammers] One hundred orders?! All at one time?!\nSassy Saddles: According to my pattern, the next piece is The Success of the Signature Dress, so I do not see the problem!\n[beat]\nApplejack: Uh...\nPinkie Pie: Cupcake?\nRarity: [clears throat] First of all, Sassy Saddles, I would have appreciated getting to name the final gown from my collection myself.\nSassy Saddles: [short laugh] My research shows that your \"Reign in Stain\" name was a play on words that was both very confusing and quite unappealing.\nRarity: [disgruntled laugh] While I see your point, we should have discussed it prior to the grand opening, Sassy.\nSassy Saddles: My only goal is for Canterlot Carousel to succeed. That's why I changed the name, and that is why I took all those orders for the Princess Dress.\nRarity: [stammering] But... But receiving orders for one hundred dresses in one day, [stammering] it's just too much too soon!\nSassy Saddles: Are you actually saying we should... cancel these orders?!\nRarity: Wha... But... [stammering] Uh, n-no, Sassy. Promises were made, and I shall sew my very best to provide each and every pony a Princess Dress full of TLC.\nSassy Saddles: Oh, thank you, Rarity, thank you!\nRarity: [sighs]\n\nSassy Saddles: Oh, satin and silk, Rarity, are you sure you don't want your friends to help you make the dresses?\nRarity: No, Sassy. These orders are my responsibility. All I have to do is stick to my plan so I can deliver each and every Princess Dress in keeping with my Rules of Rarity!\n\n[Rarity]\nThe rules of Rarity, guaranteed quality\nThis I can assure\nFor each and every dress\nI vow to give finesse\nWith time, love, and couture\n\nThe rules of Rarity, guaranteed quality\nThis I can assure\nFor each and every dress\nI vow to give finesse\nWith time, love, and couture\n\nMy favorite moment's when a pony sees it\nThat special gown that she just adores\nThat pony's now in style\nMy hard work's all worthwhile\nOh, yes, it makes my heart\nMy heart just soar\n\nMy favorite moment's when a pony sees it\nThat special gown that she just adores\nThat pony's now in style\nMy hard work's all worthwhile\nOh, yes, it makes my heart\nMy heart just soar\n\n[instrumental]\n\n[Rarity]\nThe rules of Rarity, just a parody\nNo dress here's unique\nThe panels all the same\nEach colored windowpane\nI fashion only makes me want to shriek!\n[sighs]\n\nThe rules of Rarity, just a parody\nNo dress here's unique\nThe panels all the same\nEach colored windowpane\nI fashion only makes me want to shriek!\n[sighs]\n\nOh, to create would give me elation\nTo feel once again some inspiration\nCome on now, Rarity\nGive me some clarity\nTime for your couture love to rule\n\nOh, to create would give me elation\nTo feel once again some inspiration\nCome on now, Rarity\nGive me some clarity\nTime for your couture love to rule\n\nThe rules of Rarity, extra TLC\nThis feels more sublime\nSoon now, they will see how good these can be\nWith a little extra shine\n\nThe rules of Rarity, extra TLC\nThis feels more sublime\nSoon now, they will see how good these can be\nWith a little extra shine\n\nThe rules of Rarity, guaranteed quality\nAll can see it's true\nThese new gems add such flair\nTheir beauty can't compare\nThis old style suddenly gleams anew\n[humming]\n[door opens]\n[bell rings]\nRarity: Is that the customer who ordered this Princess Dress?\nSassy Saddles: I'll take care of her. You keep working.\nRarity: Uh, actually, I'd love to see her reaction to this particular dress.\nSassy Saddles: Paisley and poplin, Rarity, look at all the orders you still have to finish, and you want to take a break? Now?\nRarity: Well, it's just I made some really lovely changes to this dress\u2014\nSassy Saddles: You did what?! But every Princess Dress is supposed to be exactly the same!\nRarity: Yes yes I know, but these gems just spoke to me, and\u2014\nSassy Saddles: Fine. Go see her reaction.\n\nThe rules of Rarity, guaranteed quality\nAll can see it's true\nThese new gems add such flair\nTheir beauty can't compare\nThis old style suddenly gleams anew\n[humming]\n\nRarity: Hello, and welcome to Canterlot Carousel! I am so pleased to present to you your\u2014\n\"Cayenne\": Princess Dress! Finally! I've been simply desperate to get this ever since I saw Princess Twilight wearing it on your\u2014 ...Wait a minute. There's something different.\nRarity: Well as an artiste, I did take the liberty to change a few minor details.\n[beat]\nRarity: I, eheh, I saw these gems glistening in the light, and they just spoke to me. Aren't they lovely? And so unique!\n\"Cayenne\": [sigh] They're... fine. But they're not what I ordered, are they?\nRarity: Uh, no. No, they're not.\n\"Cayenne\": I want the dress to be exactly like the one Princess Twilight wore. Understand?\nRarity: Yes... Y-Yes, of course.\n\n[Rarity]\nThe rules of Rarity\nOnce stood for something\nBut now it feels just like some factory\nNow every dress I make\nWith every flaw and mistake\nOh, how it makes my heart\nMy heart just break\n[sewing machine whirring]\nSassy Saddles: Raving rick-rack, Rarity! You made two hundred Princess Dresses!\nRarity: [deadpan] Yes. Isn't it spectacular?\nSassy Saddles: And I have a special surprise for you! The latest issue of Cosmare magazine just hit the stands!\nRarity: [reading] \"Canterlot's newest rising star\"?\nSassy Saddles: And in the hour since the magazine's come out, we've gotten another hundred new orders for the Princess Dress!\n[thud]\nRarity: [weakly] One... hundred more... Princess Dresses?! I'm the Cosmare cover pony... I have the most successful shop in Canterlot... I've gotten everything I ever wanted... but I'm miserable!\nSassy Saddles: [short laugh] How could you possibly be miserable? My pattern is perfect! Cosmare Cover Pony \u2013 done! You have your signature gown, the Princess Dress of Success!\nRarity: I don't want to make another hundred Princess Dresses!\nSassy Saddles: I have a piece for that! Assemble the Assembly Line! You'll never have to sew again!\nRarity: What?! No!\nSassy Saddles: Yes! Then the Canterlot Carousel never closes! And Sassy Saddles' boutique succeeds!\nRarity: Stop! This is not your boutique! And if this is what success in Canterlot looks like, I want no part of it! Now, make up flyers for a going-out-of-business sale! I'm closing Canterlot Carousel!\nSassy Saddles: What?! No! Oh, you can't, Rarity! I-I've worked too hard to make this a success! I can't be a part of another failed boutique!\n[door closes]\n\nThe rules of Rarity\nOnce stood for something\nBut now it feels just like some factory\nNow every dress I make\nWith every flaw and mistake\nOh, how it makes my heart\nMy heart just break\n\n[hooks clinking]\nRarity: [to a dress] Oh, don't you look lovely? Nice to see you out here again. [to herself, hushed] Seems Sassy Saddles isn't rushing to open the door this time. Hm.\n[door opens]\nRarity: Welcome to the going-out-of-business sale of Canterlot Carousel.\n[ponies chattering]\nPretzel: Hey, is this Princess Dress on sale?\nRarity: Oh, no, I'm sorry, the Princess Dress has been discontinued. But there are plenty of other lovely dresses on sale today.\n\"Moonlight Raven\": [flatly] Whoa. This dress completely speaks to my soul. Can I try it on?\nRarity: Certainly. The dressing area is right back there.\n\"Sunshine Smiles\": This is the most amazing of amazing dresses! Just looking at it brightens my day!\nRarity: And I'm sure you'll feel even brighter once you try it on!\n\"North Point\": Do you still have this In-spire-ation dress that's in the new issue of Cosmare?\nRarity: Oh, yes, I do. It's-It's right here.\n\"North Point\": Bats in the belfry! I have to try it on!\n\"Moonlight Raven\": [flatly] Whoa. This dress makes me feel like a princess.\n\"Sunshine Smiles\": And this dress makes me feel like a princess!\n\"Citrus Blush\": This gown is quite beautiful, but it totally clashes with my complexion.\nRarity: Hmmm. Perhaps you'd be even more taken with this one. It was inspired by the fountain in the Canterlot Castle garden. I call it the \"Fountain of Truth\"!\n\"Citrus Blush\": It's exactly what I've been dreaming of!\nRarity: Oh! Well, then I'll finish it, and the gown shall be yours! [to herself] How can I have forgotten? This is what I've been dreaming about!\n\n[Rarity]\nMy favorite moment's when a pony sees it\nThat special gown that she just adores\nThat pony's now in style\nMy hard work's all worthwhile\nOh, yes, it makes my heart\nMy heart just soar!\nRarity: Attention, everypony! Canterlot Carousel will not be closing!\n[crowd cheering]\n\"Moonlight Raven\": [flatly] But this stuff's still on sale, right?\nRarity: [giggles] Yes, yes, of course.\nSassy Saddles: Oh, Rarity, I'm so sorry. I focused on that one dress, and the rest of Rarity's Royal Regalia paid the price.\nRarity: Well, so did the Princess Dress. The more I sold, the more each dress lost its time, love, and couture, becoming terrible, lackluster, and common.\nSassy Saddles: I think I finally understand the Rules of Rarity... and will apply them at my next job.\nRarity: I beg your pardon? The Rules of Rarity are only to be applied at Canterlot Carousel! Which is why you must continue to manage the boutique while I'm in Ponyville.\nSassy Saddles: Ponyville?\nRarity: Well, yes, I'll come to Canterlot with new designs and to see the customers of course, but Ponyville was always going to be my home base.\nSassy Saddles: [gasps] Bobbins and bodkins, Rarity! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! And I promise to run everything following your rules.\nRarity: I would expect nothing less.\n\"Whoa Nelly\": Oh, my gosh, a sale! Do you have the Princess Dress?!\nRarity and Sassy Saddles: No! [laughing]\n\nMy favorite moment's when a pony sees it\nThat special gown that she just adores\nThat pony's now in style\nMy hard work's all worthwhile\nOh, yes, it makes my heart\nMy heart just soar!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nRarity: Oh, Sassy Saddles, don't you just love my new Femme Mystique Chic line of gowns?\nSassy Saddles: [gasps] Sequins and sashes, Rarity, they're exquisite!

Her stories are always full of mystery and suspense and, best of all... fabulous costumes!\nSassy Saddles: They're perfect! [beat] What are you doing?\nRarity: [humming] Oh, uh, just making some minor adjustments. [blows on dress] Shadow Spade believes it all comes down to attention to detail. And so do I. There!

What are you doing in Canterlot?\nRainbow Dash: I'm here for Princess Celestia's royal garden opening tomorrow.\nSassy Saddles: Oh, yes! Rumor has it the gardens are especially lush this season. I heard that the Wonderbolts will be kicking things off with an aerial display.\nRarity: You heard right. And Rainbow Dash is here to fly with them. So exciting!\nRainbow Dash: Well, kind of exciting. Technically, I'm not flying. I'm just the lucky Reserve who was called in to be the backup flyer in case a Wonderbolt can't perform.\nRarity: Oh, don't be so modest. Out of all the Reserves, you were the one chosen.\nRainbow Dash: It is pretty sweet. And I do get to stay in the castle, hang out with the Wonderbolts, and eat awesome food at the dinner tonight. Speaking of the dinner, you're still coming, right?\nRarity: Heavens, yes! A chance to dress up, be charming and show off my newest femme mystique couture? I wouldn't miss it for all of Equestria.\nRainbow Dash: Great! See ya tonight!\n[door closes]\n[mannequins rattling]\n[door slams open]\n[crash]\nRarity: Ooh, the rhinestones I ordered!

I'm not sure I have time to redo your order.\nRarity: Of course you don't. Your job is so difficult. Honestly, I don't know how you keep all of those orders straight.\n\"Package Deal\": [chuckle] It is pretty tough, what with the boxes all being... box-shaped.\nRarity: Oh, y\u2014oh yes, and I very much appreciate it. But if there was any way you could squeeze in one more little delivery, I would be eternally grateful.\n\"Package Deal\": [laughs nervously] Well, for you, Rarity, I'll see what I can do.\n[door closes]\nSassy Saddles: Rarity, you could sweet-talk a filly out of candy!\nRarity: Oh, [chuckles], it was nothing.

Don't you know who this is?!\nRarity: A gentlepony with fabulous taste in colognes and scarves?\nRainbow Dash: It's Wind Rider!\nRarity: Oh! So nice to meet you!\nRainbow Dash: You didn't let me finish! He's a living legend. He holds the Wonderbolt record in the Mustang Marathon!\nWind Rider: Well, that was a long time ago. Honestly, I can't believe I still hold the record.\nSpitfire: Wind Rider, I see you met Rainbow Dash! She's one of our most promising Reserves. She just might beat your record.\nWind Rider: Really now?\nRainbow Dash: Oh, heh, I'm nowhere near as good as you. I mean, I'm fast, but I don't have the endurance to go long distances.\nSpitfire: Ah, don't be modest. A little practice and you'll be beating records in no time.\nWind Rider: Heh-heh. Well, it's nice to meet you fillies.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Not as nice as it is to meet you, sir. [barely-contained laughter] I can't believe I just met Wind Rider!\nMisty Fly: Yeah, he's coming out of retirement to take the spot of honor in the center of our aerial flower formation tomorrow.\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] Really? That's incredible! Guess I'll just watch Wind Rider being awesome from the sidelines... practice tomorrow is gonna be so boring.\nRarity: I don't suppose I could keep you company?\nRainbow Dash: You could! They always let friends and family come watch practices!\n[splash]\nRarity: Mm, ooh!\nRainbow Dash: Oops. Heh, sorry about that. Lemme help you clean that up. [hocks and spits]\nRarity: Uh, no-no, it's almost impossible to get stains out of silk. But not to worry. I've come prepared!\n\nRarity: That dinner was absolutely divine. Thanks for inviting me! Ooh, you're staying in the east tower? Those rooms have the best view of Canterlot!\nSpitfire: How lucky are we? Well, we better get some shuteye before practice.\n[door shuts]\nRainbow Dash: See you tomorrow, Rarity!\nRarity: Good night!\n\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Thanks for keeping me company, Rarity. If you weren't here, well, I don't know who I'd be talking to right now.\n[splat]\nSoarin: Eh, you'd be talkin' to me. Rainbow Dash, Spitfire's mom sent a message that she was sick. She had to leave to take care of her.\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] Oh, no! I hope her mom's okay!\nSoarin: Me too. In the meantime, we need you to fly in her place.\nRainbow Dash: L-Like, in the actual show?\nSoarin: Unless Spitfire comes back, yes.\nRainbow Dash: I won't let you down, Soarin! [squeals] This is the best thing ever! Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh! [sing-song] I'm gonna get to fly with Wind Rider and the Wonderbolts, 'cause I'm the bestest and I'm awesome and they know it! [continues under] Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh...\nSoarin: Uh... Rainbow Dash?\nRarity: [hushed] Shh! Let her have this, darling.\n\nRarity: Hello there! Friend or family?\nStormy Flare: Family. My daughter's a Wonderbolt, but I don't see her up there. Do you know Spitfire?\nRarity: Ooh, you're Spitfire's mum? But I thought you were sick.\nStormy Flare: What?\nRarity: Well, Spitfire got a note from you saying you weren't feeling well, and she went home to take care of you.\nStormy Flare: I didn't send a note.\nRarity: That's so strange.\nSoarin: Stormy Flare? Aren't you supposed to be sick? 'Kay, what's happening?\nStormy Flare: I don't know. But I do know I didn't send my daughter a note.\nRarity: Could somepony have sent Spitfire a fake note?\nMisty Fly: Who would do such a thing?\nSoarin: Somepony who wanted her out of the show, I suppose.\nRainbow Dash: Why would anypony want that?\nWind Rider: Maybe so they could take her spot.\n\nRainbow Dash: Me?! I would never do that to Spitfire! Why would you think it was me?\nBlaze: I did see you and Spitfire leave the dinner together.\nRainbow Dash: We were room neighbors in the castle!\nMisty Fly: And you did say you'd do anything to fly with Wind Rider.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, but I didn't mean anything.\nSoarin: Spitfire came by my room and told me she had to go see her mom at around midnight. Where were you then?\nRainbow Dash: I was asleep at midnight... having this totally amazing dream. There I was at the arena flying with Wind Rider and the Wonderbolts, like I've always wanted to\u2014\n[camera flashes]\nRainbow Dash: \u2014ah, eh, never mind. Not helping.\n[Wonderbolts whispering]\nSoarin: Rainbow Dash, if you can prove that somepony else is behind Spitfire's disappearance before the start of the show, then you can still fly with us. In the meantime, Misty Fly, Blaze, head over to Stormy Flare's house and try to find Spitfire and bring her back. [to Rainbow Dash] I have to warn you, if you sent that letter, the bylaws are clear. I'd have no choice but to ban you from the Wonderbolts forever. Understand?\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] I understand. But how am I gonna prove I didn't send a letter that I didn't send?\nRarity: With me! Detective Rarity is on the case, and we are going to get to the bottom of this faster than my costume change!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, what's with the getup?\nRarity: Obviously, I am channeling Shadow Spade through these gorgeous garments, and she would say that the best way to prove that you didn't send the letter is to find out whoever did. First stop \u2013 the scene of the crime!\n\n[noir music plays]\nRarity: [narrating] We had a long road ahead of us, Rainbow Dash and I. Well, not too long because we didn't have much time, but the point is... I was up for the challenge.\n[drawers opening and closing]\nRarity: [narrating] There I was, surveying the crime scene, and looking tr\u00e8s chic while doing it. [normally] This must be the envelope for the letter Spitfire got! [sniffs] Hmm. These look like hairs from a rainbow mane!\nRainbow Dash: [gulps] That's not good.\nRarity: [narrating] Rainbow Dash was getting antsy, but I had faith I could clear her name and find the real culprit.\nRainbow Dash: What are you doing?\nRarity: [stammers] Uh, just thinking thoughts. [narrating] Rainbow Dash was right. In order to solve the mystery, we had to be focused. Driven. One hundred percent in the\u2014 [normally] Ooh! The damask pattern on these curtains is exquisite! Oh, and this velvet rope-holder \u2013 oh, it's just\u2014\nRainbow Dash: We don't have time to look at the d\u00e9cor! They're gonna kick me out of the Wonderbolts unless we solve this thing!\nRarity: I know, Rainbow, and I'm on this case like a charm on a bracelet! Here's what I'm thinking: somepony had to bring Spitfire that letter, which means somepony must have seen them!\n\nRarity: I just have a few questions for you, and I'm sure once we get some things cleared up, we'll\u2014\nRainbow Dash: Come on, Rarity, we don't have all day! [to a guard] Where were you on the night of last night at midnight?!\nCastle Guard 1: We were here, guarding the hallway entrance like we were supposed to.\nRainbow Dash: A likely story.\nCastle Guard 1: I'm telling you, we were there all night, and no one went in or out of that hallway.\nSpearhead: Except for you.\nRainbow Dash: What are you tryin' to say?!\nSpearhead: Just that there are only two rooms in the northwest wing: yours and Spitfire's. So the only other pony who had access to that wing was you.\nRarity: [narrating] The waters were getting choppy. Rainbow Dash's tactics were, well, horrid. It was time for another approach. [normally] Perhaps I should take it from here! You castle guards have such a difficult job. I'm guessing that at times it can be rather... boring.\nCastle Guard 1: It is. I've counted all three hundred and forty five bolts in the ceiling tiles two hundred and ninety three times!\nRarity: And of course being a castle guard can be thankless work. I'm not saying you did, but if you took a break, you more than deserved it.\nCastle Guard 1: Oh, you're right. We don't get a lot of recognition for what we do.\nSpearhead: Except for last night when somepony was nice enough to leave a cake for us. So we did take one little break when we ate that cake.\nRarity: What kind of cake was it?\nSpearhead: Cherry with a custard filling.\nRarity: Was the frosting vanilla or chocolate?\nCastle Guard 1: Chocolate.\nRarity: Was the base of the cake decorated with buttercream rosettes?\nCastle Guard 1: It was.\nRainbow Dash: Ugh, who cares how it was decorated?!\nRarity: [narrating] Rainbow Dash was questioning my methods. But I knew what I was doing.\nRainbow Dash: Do you?\nRarity: Oh, oh, oh. Did I say that one out loud?\nRainbow Dash: I mean, even I think I'm guilty at this point! I really did want to fly in that show! What if I wrote that note when I was asleep?! Do you know what I do when I sleep?! Because I sure don't!\nRarity: Oh, calm down, Rainbow Dash. We'll get to the bottom of this. There's only one bakery in Canterlot that makes a chocolate cherry cake with custard filling and buttercream frosting rosettes and that's...\n\nRarity: ...Cinnamon Chai's Tea and Cake Shop!\nCinnamon Chai: Hello, how can I help you?\nRarity: I've heard you have the best chocolate cherry custard cake with buttercream frosting rosettes in town!\nCinnamon Chai: Ah, you travel in the right circles! We have the only chocolate cherry custard cake with buttercream frosting rosettes in town!\nRarity: Oh, no. But somepony's already bought it! Who was the lucky pony?\nCinnamon Chai: [beat] I can't even say!\nRarity: Why? Because it was somepony famous?\nCinnamon Chai: No... because it was hard to tell! She was wearing a trench coat, sunglasses, and a scarf around her head that covered most of her face. But I do remember she had a really deep, raspy voice.\nRainbow Dash: What do you mean, raspy?\nCinnamon Chai: Well, kinda like yours.\nRainbow Dash: [gulps]\nRarity: If there's anything else you can remember, dish.\nCinnamon Chai: Well, have I got a story for you! The pony who bought the cake threw a big fit when she accidentally got chocolate ganache on her scarf!\nRarity: That's terrible! What color was the scarf?\nCinnamon Chai: White! No, maybe more an ivory...\nRarity: You don't say!\nRainbow Dash: I can't believe you're talking fashion at a time like this!\nRarity: Rainbow, don't panic. I need you to trust me.\nRainbow Dash: Trust you?! You've spent more time changing clothes than trying to help me! I'm doomed!\nRarity: No, you're not! Come on!\n\nRarity: [narrating] Rainbow Dash was obviously upset, but I had all my ducks in a row. Except one.\n[duck quacks]\nRarity: [narrating] She was not going to like it, but there was only one way to find out if my suspicions were correct.\n\n[rain pouring]\n[door opens]\nBlaze: We looked everywhere, but Spitfire wasn't at her mom's house!\nStormy Flare: Where could she be?\n[door opens]\n[lightning cracks]\nRarity: I have found the culprit!\nSoarin: [gulps]\nRarity: Somepony sent Spitfire away and framed Rainbow Dash for it. And that pony was none other than... Wind Rider!\n[lightning cracks]\n[Wonderbolts expressing surprise]\n\nRainbow Dash: Rarity, I can't believe you would accuse Wind Rider of framing me! He's a living legend, for pony's sake!\nRarity: All the evidence points to him!\nRainbow Dash: Peh! What evidence could you possibly have? All you did was ask about cake, admire d\u00e9cor, and change outfits a gazillion times!\nRarity: Let me explain. I never believed you would send Spitfire away. When we found the rainbow hairs in Spitfire's room, I could tell they didn't fall out. They... were cut! Nopony loses hair in a chunk. And look at the ends. It's a straight line! They were clearly cut with shears, which means somepony planted it! Then when we were examining Spitfire's room, I smelled something on the envelope. Juniper Phoenix, Wind Rider's cologne of choice! Then, in the castle hallway, I noticed some of the damask curtains fell out of their velvet rope-holder, indicating that somepony had been hiding behind them! Perhaps after they dropped off the fake letter?\nWind Rider: Juniper Phoenix is a very popular fragrance, and anypony could have moved those curtains.\nRarity: Precisely why I questioned the castle guards! They were at their post at the entrance to the hallway all night, except for a small window of time when somepony brought them cake. A cake that was ordered by a girl pony with a raspy voice! Whoever ordered the cake got a chocolate stain on her ivory scarf, and I couldn't help but notice that Wind Rider's scarf is tied in a tight Windsor knot instead of its usual loose slipknot! And why is that? Is it to hide the chocolate stain?!\n[Wonderbolts gasping]\nWind Rider: Ah, this is preposterous. Wonderbolts, you don't believe a word of this, right?\nRarity: Just admit it \u2013 you're as guilty of framing Rainbow Dash as you are of ruining that ivory scarf!\nWind Rider: Ah, fine! You caught me! I did it!\nRainbow Dash: But why, Wind Rider?! Was it because I took the last broccoli at the dinner and you really, really wanted it?\nRarity: No. It was because he was afraid that you would break his long-distance Wonderbolt record! I heard him when Spitfire said you were close to breaking his record. He said, and I quote, 'Heh-heh'. That's the polite but disingenuous laugh you make when you want to seem happy but really you're not.\nWind Rider: I thought if I could get Rainbow Dash kicked out of the Wonderbolts forever, my record could be preserved.\nRainbow Dash: Really? That is so not cool. And I thought you were the coolest Wonderbolt ever. Until now.\nWind Rider: I did what I had to do to protect my record! Sometimes you gotta play dirty to be the best!\nRainbow Dash: That's not what being a Wonderbolt is all about.\nSoarin: She's right! Wonderbolts look out for each other! Which reminds me, where is Spitfire?\nWind Rider: I sent her the letter pretending to be Stormy Flare. I told her I had Pegasitis, and the only cure is the ice iris in the Crystal Mountains.\nRainbow Dash: No wonder she's been gone so long. Ice irises are almost impossible to find in spring!\nSoarin: The Crystal Mountains are too far for anypony to make it there and back before the royal garden opening! Rainbow Dash, we need you to fly in Spitfire's place!\nRainbow Dash: But Spitfire shouldn't have to miss this! I'm gonna get her!\nSoarin: But you'll never make it in time!\nRainbow Dash: Then there's no time to lose!\n\nBlaze: Rainbow Dash is still gone!\nRarity: Oh, don't panic. If I know Rainbow Dash, she'll come through.\n[door opens]\nSpitfire: [panting]\nSoarin: Spitfire, you're back! I can't believe you made it!\nSpitfire: [out of breath] I wouldn't have, if Rainbow hadn't found me so fast! Gave me enough time to fly back!\nRainbow Dash: Rare, I couldn't have done it without you. And I'm sorry I doubted you. But why didn't you tell me what you were doing?\nRarity: Well, I didn't want to get your hopes up until I was sure, and I couldn't be sure until I saw that chocolate stain.\nRainbow Dash: Thank you for believing in me, even when I was doubting you. I'm some friend, huh?\nRarity: Actually, you're quite a good friend. You went to get Spitfire, even though it meant you couldn't fly today.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] I'll get my chance one day.\nSpitfire: Or today. How'd you like Wind Rider's spot in the show?\nWind Rider: Uh, w-w-what? Y-You can't do this to me! I'm one of the greatest Wonderbolts there ever was!\nSpitfire: Not anymore. For attempting to frame Rainbow Dash, I hereby strip you of your Wonderbolts status!\nSoarin: [to Rainbow Dash] So, would you like to fly with us?\nRainbow Dash: Would I?! Woo-hoo! Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, aww yeah...\nSoarin: Uh, Rainbow Dash?\nRainbow Dash: [embarrassed noise] Coming!\n\nRarity: [narrating] So my friend got her moment in the sun. Or the center of an aerial flower, as the case may be. And as for me? I got a chance to show off my Femme Mystique Chic collection!\nStormy Flare: That's nice, dear.\nRarity: Oh, did I say that out loud?\n\n[noir music plays over credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nTwilight Sparkle: Ehh...

It looks like you've been summoned to this particular neighborhood here.\nRarity: We're off to solve a friendship problem in one of the busiest and most vibrant cities in all of Equestria! Isn't this exciting?! [squeals]\nApplejack: Seems a hair odd, though, don't it? Map callin' me to a big city like Manehattan?\nTwilight Sparkle: You may be more of a country pony at heart, Applejack, but the map picked you two because you're the best ponies to tackle this particular mission.\nApplejack: But how will we even know what our mission's supposed to be? That neighborhood probably has twice as many ponies as all of Ponyville.\nRarity: Pff. Kch. Ts! More like three times! Why, it's not only home to the Haypacking District \u2013 it's also home to the Fashion District! [to Twilight] Hmm. Shame you weren't called as well, though, darling. You did end up quite a fan of the hustle and bustle of Manehattan on our last visit.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's such an exciting city, and there's still so much I'd like to do there. So many museums and historical landmarks to visit. Not to mention all the libraries! But this is your mission. Heh-heh. Don't worry about me. I've got plenty of... books... to keep me... busy.\nSpike: [scoffs]\nRarity and Applejack: Mm-hmm.\nRarity: [gasps] I just remembered something!

This isn't working.\nApplejack: [sighs] I'm not sure what we're supposed to do. To be honest, I'm still not even sure what the map called me here for.\nRarity: Oh, try not to worry, Applejack.

There's a guest performance by a local theater troupe, the Method Mares, as well as games, food, and much, much more. This event promises to bring our Bronclyn neighbors together and restore our sense of community, but there's so much to do and we need your help.\" Huh. [gasps] Darling, this is it! The contact on the flyer is Coco Pommel!\nApplejack: Oh, right! She's the one you got a job makin' costumes for that designer friend o' yours.\nRarity: Don't you see?! This must be why the map called us here! Oh, and you were so worried!\nApplejack: Well, I suppose it's at least worth lookin' into... that is, if we can ever get off this street corner.\n\nCoco Pommel: I can't believe you found my flyer. Quite a coincidence, don't you think?\nRarity: Applejack and I were specifically summoned here to be of service, and you, my dear friend, are in need of help. It's no coincidence, darling. It's fate! [drinks]\nApplejack: [gulps] This Midsummer Theater Revival \u2013 what is it, exactly? [chews]\nCoco Pommel: An outdoor play held at the community park. Many moons ago, local theater troupes would perform, and ponies in the neighborhood would help make the costumes and design set pieces, prepare food to share during the performance.\nApplejack: Y'all do look like you're enjoyin' each others' company. Kinda reminds me of Ponyville.\nRarity: It sounds lovely, darling.\nCoco Pommel: It was, up until several moons ago.\nApplejack: What happened?\nCoco Pommel: That's Charity Kindheart. She was a well-known costume designer on Bridleway. She started the Midsummer Theater Revival as a way to share her passion for theater with the neighborhood. No matter how busy she was, she always made time for the Revival.\n[book shuts]\nCoco Pommel: But when she moved away to be closer to her grandfillies, the neighborhood lost the special tradition she had started, and worse, the sense of community it fostered.\nStreet Pony: Hey! I'm trottin\u2019 here!\nApplejack: Nopony else stepped up to take over for Charity?\nCoco Pommel: I've been trying to. But I've just gotten a last-minute request to alter costumes for the cast of My Fair Filly, and I'm afraid I haven't made much progress. Oh... There's just so much to do to bring back the Midsummer Revival, and my flyers haven't attracted a single volunteer!\nRarity: Say no more! You finish up your work, and by this time tomorrow, you'll be up to your mane in ponies who want to lend a hoof. Applejack and I will make sure of it!\nCoco Pommel: You will?\nApplejack: You bet your boots we will!\nCoco Pommel: Oh, I don't wear boots. I find they chafe my calves when I walk.\nApplejack: It's just an expression.\n\nRarity: So you see, the Method Mares are only available on this one day, and we need all the help we can get with preparation.\n\"Fine Print\": Yeah, not a good time right now. Heh. What am I saying? It's never a good time!\n\nRarity: [clearing throat] Well? What do you think?\n\"Chock-full Carafe\": I got my own problems. You think I've got hours to dedicate to somepony else's?\n\n\"Uptown Clover\": Ah, yes, Charity's Midsummer Theater Revival. Such wonderful memories.\nApplejack: So you'll help us?\n\"Uptown Clover\": Oh, [laughs], don't be ridiculous. I run a very important oat and hay import/export business.

It's quite lovely.\nApplejack: I think she was talkin' about the Midsummer Theater Revival.\nCoco Pommel: I finished the alterations for My Fair Filly, but I've barely started the costumes for the Revival, and the Method Mares are coming to the park tomorrow for a costume fitting and rehearsal!\nRarity: Well, I could help you with the costumes.\nCoco Pommel: But what are we going to do about the rest? The park is in desperate need of repairs, and the sets still need to be built!\nApplejack: Well I know a thing or two about buildin' and fixin' things. It's kinda, well, my thing. Could be the reason the map called me here!\nRarity: You see, dear? We went out looking for volunteers when all the help you need is right here.\nApplejack: Uh-huh.\nRarity: The map wouldn't have chosen just Applejack and me if it was more than we could handle. Everything is going to be just fine!\n\nRarity: Perhaps I spoke too soon...\nCoco Pommel: Oh, dear, you're right. Are you sure you can manage this by yourself?\nApplejack: Well, there's a lot to do, but Rarity's right. The map wouldn't have called us here if we weren't up for the challenge. You two go on and take care of the costumes. I'll see you at the dress rehearsal.

But the park is still a mess, we haven't even thought about what refreshments to serve during the performance, and even if we had, we don't have a stage for the Method Mares to perform on! It's hopeless... Just hopeless!\nRarity: [hushed] I don't understand. The map summoned us here to solve a friendship problem. We've clearly found it, but why did it send the two of us? Why not Twilight? I'm sure she could have used her magic to transform this park in an instant!\nApplejack: I've been thinkin' the same thing. I mean, I can at least see why you're here \u2013 Coco's your friend, and you have an eye for costumes and all \u2013 but me? I was never gonna be able to finish a project this big.\nRarity: [dramatically] We'll return to Ponyville as failures! Why must this be, Applejack? Why? Why?! Wh\u2014\nApplejack: Now hold on there. I'm not suggestin' we pack up and go home.\nRarity: [muffled] Then what are you suggesting\u2014 [ptoo] Then what are you suggesting?\nApplejack: I'm suggestin' we stop worryin' about what we can't do and start doing what we can. I think I've got a plan. It won't be anythin' big or fancy, but it'll be somethin'. And somethin's gotta be better than nothin', right?\nCoco Pommel: I suppose so...\nApplejack: That's the spirit! Sorta...\n\n[hammering]\nApplejack: Alright, y'all, it's ready!\nOn Stage: Should we go ahead and start?\n[curtains open]\nRaspberry Beret: [as Charity Kindheart] Excuse me. I'm Charity Kindheart.

I'm sorry I couldn't get enough tickets for everypony in the neighborhood. I hope Mr. Pearblossom wasn't too disappointed. I know Trotter on the Roof is one of his favorites.\n\"Stardom\": Oh, my dear filly, don't worry about that. We're so proud of you. We shall be with you in spirit!\nRaspberry Beret: Thank you!

The Midsummer Theater Revival was always something that meant so much to me, and it seems it means quite a lot to all of you as well. I really can't take all the credit, though. My dear friends Rarity and Applejack helped me ever so much.\n[audience clapping and cheering]\nRarity: Oh, darling, please, it was just a few costumes.\nApplejack: Aw, shucks, I just happen to be good with a hammer is all. To be honest, we had much bigger plans to start. When those fell through, we decided to simplify. This here was the result.\nRarity: Oh, don't be so modest. Coco and I were lost.\nCoco Pommel: You bet your boots we were!\n\n[general chatter]\n\"Viola\": We just wanted to say how much we enjoyed the Midsummer Theater Revival and how much it inspired us!\nApplejack: Oh, yeah?\n\"Uptown Clover\": I used to think that to help my community I had to do something big. Heh-heh. And let's face it \u2013 in this day and age, who has the time for such a commitment? But here, you did something as simple as building a stage and putting on a play and, heh, look at how it's brought everypony together.\n\"Viola\": I saw Coco's flyers for volunteers but didn't think anything I'd have time to do would be that useful. Now I wish I'd offered to help, even if it was just pulling a few weeds or planting a few flowers.\nApplejack: Not sure if you noticed, but the park is far from bein' fixed up. I imagine if you look around, you'll find there's lots of little ways for you to get involved in changin' this place for the better.\n\"Viola\": And I will!\n\"Uptown Clover\": And I don't think we'll be alone!\n[cutie marks ringing]\nApplejack: Yee-hoo!\nRarity and Applejack: [laughing]\nApplejack: We did it!\nRarity: [gasps] I understand now! It all makes perfect sense!\nApplejack: Huh?\n[thunk]\nRarity: I know why the map called you here.\nApplejack: You do?\nRarity: If Twilight had used her magic to fix the park, it wouldn't have fixed the real problem, which is that these Manehattan ponies didn't think they had time to do something for their community! But by building that stage and making sure the play went on, you showed them that just by doing something small, you can make a big difference!\nApplejack: Well, I'll be!\nRarity: Seems you have more in common with the Manehattan ponies than you thought!\nApplejack: Heh-heh. But all the same, I'd sure like to head back to Ponyville on the next train. I want to check in with Apple Bloom and find out how the Sisterhooves Social turned out.\nRarity: Oh, absolutely, my dear.

As long as you share a bond that represents the spirit of the Social, you're in!\nSweetie Belle: So what do you say?\nScootaloo: You coming?\nApple Bloom: Why not, got nothin' better to do... lemme wash up and I'll meet you in a little bit.\n[thunk]\nGranny Smith: [sighs] Such a shame we don't live closer to all your second cousins. You could maybe do the Social with one of them instead. What is it, Big Mac? Y'all got an idea?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\nApple Bloom: What? What is it?!\n\nScootaloo: Today is our big day!\nRainbow Dash: We have so got this. I'm gonna go sign us in.\nSweetie Belle: I guess I'm just a little jealous you two get to compete and I don't. But at least I get to be here and cheer you on! I thought Apple Bloom was gonna be here too.\nScootaloo: Guess she changed her mind. Hey, there you are! You ready to cheer on me and Rainbow Dash to victory?\nApple Bloom: Uh, not exactly. Seems I'm gonna get to participate after all.\nSweetie Belle: [gasps] Applejack is back from Manehattan already? That must mean Rarity is back too!\nApple Bloom: No, our sisters are still gone. But it, uh... turns out my long lost cousin... 'Orchard Blossom' was able to make it last minute. [nervous laugh]\nSweetie Belle: Your cousin who what now?\nBig McIntosh: [as Orchard Blossom, falsetto] Well, I do declare! It's hotter today than the business end of a corncob pipe! [giggling]\n\nBig McIntosh: Oh, my! I'm so delighted to meet your little friends, Apple Bloom. Would these be your dear and beloved Cutie Mark Crusaders?\nApple Bloom: [sighs] Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo, cousin Orchard Blossom.\nBig McIntosh: It is my extra-ordinary pleasure to make your acquaintance.\nSweetie Belle: [deadpan] That's Big Mac in a dress.\nBig McIntosh: Big Mac? Why, as charmed as I am that you find me in the slightest resemblance to such a-a-a fine and noble product of the Apple clan, I am astonished in equal measure. However, I shall take this startling observation under advisement given that it's from such an astute and perceptive filly as yourself, Sweetie Belle.\nSweetie Belle: That's awful nice of you to say, cousin Orchard Blossom! I've been told before I'm pretty observant.\nBig McIntosh: I haven't the slightest doubt.\n\n[scribbling]\nBig McIntosh: Pardon me. My dearest cousin Applejack is regrettably unable to be here as planned, so I, her cousin Orchard Blossom, will accompany Apple Bloom in her stead. I trust that's acceptable to all concerned?\nRainbow Dash: Cousin Orchard Blossom, huh? I know Applejack has a lot of relatives, but I feel like she would've mentioned you.\nBig McIntosh: Why, you must be Rainbow Dash. You're Scootaloo's... say... how are y'all related again?\nRainbow Dash: Hm. Why don't I just let you finish signing in? [hushed] But don't think me and Scootaloo are gonna take it easy on you just 'cause you're a stallion!\nBig McIntosh: [laughs] Now, where were we?\n[crunch, crunch]\nApple Bloom: Um, excuse me. I have to... go to the bathroom. [zip]\nBig McIntosh: [tuts] You mean 'powder your muzzle', don't you, dear? Such a more, uh, feminine-like reference to nature's call, don't you agree?\n\nSweetie Belle: Have they called your brother's bluff yet?\nApple Bloom: No, but they're about to! I can't bear to watch!\nBig McIntosh: Yoo-hoo! Apple Bloom! They've approved us as a pair! [giggles] Hurry along now, precious!\nApple Bloom: I can't believe they bought it!\nSweetie Belle: It's sweet he wants to help you out like this. Weird, but sweet.\n\n[ponies singing]\nBooth Barker: Bravo, bravo! Weren't those two sisters great? Now, where are our next competitors?\nBig McIntosh: Here we are! This one, please.\nBooth Barker: Excellent choice... ma'am.\nApple Bloom: [hushed] You sure you know all the words? 'Cause it took Applejack a pretty long time to get it down.\nBig McIntosh: [hushed] Did it now?\nApple Bloom: [gulp]\n\n\n[Apple Bloom and Big McIntosh]\nWe all love our brothers\nAnd our fathers and mothers\nWe honor them like every family should\n\nWe all love our brothers\nAnd our fathers and mothers\nWe honor them like every family should\n\nBut there's somethin' that's quite unique\nWhen my sister's there with me\nAnd we share that special bond of sisterhood\n\nBut there's somethin' that's quite unique\nWhen my sister's there with me\nAnd we share that special bond of sisterhood\n\n[Apple Bloom]\nSisterhood\n\nSisterhood\n\n[Big McIntosh]\nSisterhood\n\nSisterhood\n\n[Apple Bloom]\nIs a special kind of friend\nSisterhood\n\nIs a special kind of friend\nSisterhood\n\n[Big McIntosh]\nSisterhood\n\nSisterhood\n\n[Apple Bloom]\nIs a bond that never ends\n\nIs a bond that never ends\n\n[Apple Bloom and Big McIntosh]\nIt's not always perfect\nYou might fight or be misunderstood\nBut together you'll always have sisterhood\n\nIt's not always perfect\nYou might fight or be misunderstood\nBut together you'll always have sisterhood\n\n[Big McIntosh]\nSisterhood\n\nSisterhood\n\n[Apple Bloom]\nSisterhood\n\nSisterhood\n\n[Big McIntosh]\nSisterhood\n\nSisterhood\n\n[Apple Bloom]\nSisterhood\n\nSisterhood\n\n[Big McIntosh]\nSisterhood\n\nSisterhood\n\n[Apple Bloom]\nSisterhood\n\nSisterhood\n\n[Big McIntosh]\n[deep bass] Sisterhood!\n\n[deep bass] Sisterhood!\n\n[Apple Bloom]\n[joining in] ...ood\n\n[joining in] ...ood\n\n[ponies chatter]\nApple Bloom: [nervous laugh] Are you okay, cousin Orchard Blossom? You sounded like you were catchin' a cold or somethin' else that would make your voice sound totally different right at the end of the song. [nervous laugh]\nBig McIntosh: Just a frog in my throat, dear. Probably just need to get a sip of water. If you'll excuse us, we've another event in which to participate. Oh, my, that certainly didn't go as I had planned. But don't you worry. We'll get you a blue ribbon yet, Apple Bloom.\nApple Bloom: You sure about that?\nBig McIntosh: As sure as my name is cousin Orchard Blossom.\nApple Bloom: [to herself] But that isn't your name!\n\nApple Bloom and Big McIntosh: C-O-U-S-I-N-S! Which two sis\u2014 uh, cousins are the best? We are!

Why, I knew that juggling routine like the back of my hoof! But never you mind. There is still the race to be run!\nApple Bloom: I really appreciate all the effort, Big Ma\u2014 cousin Orchard Blossom, but maybe we just skip the whole obstacle course thing and call it a day.\nBig McIntosh: Why, Apple Bloom! I wouldn't hear of it! Your cousin Orchard Blossom may be many things, but she is not a quitter.\nApple Bloom: I'm sure she's not, but it's like Applejack said! There'll be more Sisterhooves Socials down the line, and I'm sure she'll help me get a blue ribbon next time around.\nBig McIntosh: B-But you wanted to win it this Sisterhooves Social! And no matter what, I am gonna get you that win! Why, I simply have to.\n\nRainbow Dash: Alright, Scootaloo, remember the parts where teamwork really comes into play!\nScootaloo: How could I forget? We've been training all week!\nRainbow Dash: Okay, hot stuff! What's our move on the grape squish?\nScootaloo: The alley-oop.\nRainbow Dash: Apple toss?\nScootaloo: Flip-flop.\nRainbow Dash: Egg carrying?\nScootaloo: Flutter-bomb.\nRainbow Dash and Scootaloo: Yeah!\nBig McIntosh: Oh, dear.\nGranny Smith: [through megaphone] Competi-sis-tors!

The Sisterhooves Social has always had a loose policy when it comes to what counts as a \"sister\". But we do have a strict policy when it comes to sportsponyship! In your \"sister's\" desperation to win, he used brute strength to physically take out the competitors. Uh, that kind of behavior is not just unbecoming of a lady, but quite frankly, of anypony! And for that, you two are hereby disqualified!\nRainbow Dash: Hah! Looks like we win, squirt!\nScootaloo: Woo-hoo! Yeah!\n[ponies cheering]\nApple Bloom: I told you I should've just waited until the next Social to win with Applejack.\nBig McIntosh: [sighs]\n[balloon popping]\n\nApple Bloom: You know I'm... not mad, right?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nApple Bloom: I mean... let's face it \u2013 you dressin' up as my cousin Orchard Blossom was a pretty crazy idea in the first place.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nApple Bloom: And it's not like you got me disqualified from the Social forever or anythin'. I can participate next time with Applejack. Everything's fine.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nApple Bloom: I just don't understand why you went so crazy there at the end of the race. I mean, I know you like to win an' all, but... you wanna tell me what's goin' on?\nBig McIntosh: Nope.\nApple Bloom: Alright. Well, it's getting late. You comin'?\nBig McIntosh: Nope.\nApple Bloom: Okay. See you later, I guess...\nBig McIntosh: Apple Bloom?\nApple Bloom: Yeah?\nBig McIntosh: When you were little, you used to look up to me, thought I was the best thing since zap apple jam. Things are different now. Applejack's the hero of the Apple family, always rushin' off to save Equestria. And I'm just here on the farm, doin' chores, helpin' out the way I can, nothin' special, nobody's hero. I guess I just thought... oh, never mind. Here I am about to start blabberin' on about my feelin's. You don't wanna hear all this.\nApple Bloom: Yes, I do!\nBig McIntosh: I guess I just thought if I could... fill in for Applejack at the Social and get you a blue ribbon, well, I could be somepony you looked up to again. Be your hero again. Even if it was for just a day. It was foolish and I'm ashamed. Please, I just wanna be alone right now.\nApple Bloom: Yeah, well, too bad, you big goof! 'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere. And I know that you're always gonna be here when I need you. Heck, you'll do a whole obstacle course in high heels if you think it'll help me get somethin' I want. You're my big brother. You've always been a hero to me, Big Mac, and you always will be. I'm real sorry I haven't been lettin' you know that's how I feel. Guess both of us have been holdin' back when it comes to expressin' ourselves, huh?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nGranny Smith: Big Mac! Apple Bloom! Your sister's home! She says she's got quite a story to tell about her trip to Manehattan!\nApple Bloom: Be there in a bit! I'm spending some quality time with my big brother! [to Big Mac] Hey, Big Mac?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup?\nApple Bloom: How do you think cousin Orchard Blossom would describe this sunset?\nBig McIntosh: [chuckles] Why, dear, I do declare this is the most beautiful sunset my eyes have ever looked upon. Though sitting here on these tree roots is a trifle uncomfortable for my hindquarters.\nApple Bloom and Big McIntosh: [laughing]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nApple Bloom: Okay, Crusaders!

I just happened to be here for the school board meeting, and this is what I see when we adjourn? My daughter associating with confused, insignificant lowlifes?

Come, Diamond Tiara!\nDiamond Tiara: No, mother!\nSpoiled Rich: Excuse me?!\nDiamond Tiara: You've spent your life acting like a high horse and raised me to follow in your hoofprints! At first I thought this was fine, but then I finally realized I wanted something you don't have \u2013 friends!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [gasps]\nFoals and Cheerilee: [gasps]\nSpoiled Rich: That's enough, Diamond Tiara! Step away from those blank flanks!\nDiamond Tiara: These are the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and they are my friends! You need to stop calling them such mean and hurtful names! They are working harder to get their cutie marks than anypony I've ever seen! And they will get them exactly when they discover their true talent, which I guarantee will be amazing! Now, will you please deliver this to father?\nSpoiled Rich: Yes, of course, dear...\nDiamond Tiara: I have to thank you, Crusaders. Obviously, I've known since I got my cutie mark that my talent is getting other ponies to do what I want. I just asked my father if he could donate the money for the new playground equipment!\n[foals chattering]\nDiamond Tiara: [to Pipsqueak] I knew you were worried for a second there, weren't you? Ha!

But when we take a little time off, we end up helpin' other ponies figure out their true talent!\nSweetie Belle: Yeah, and I think that's way more important than worrying about our cutie marks, don't you?\nScootaloo: Absolutely! I don't care if I ever get my cutie mark as long as I get to hang out with my best friends.\nApple Bloom: So what do you say, Crusaders? Want to just focus on helpin' others find their cutie marks?\nScootaloo and Sweetie Belle: Yeah!\n[magic zaps]\n[foals gasping]\nSweetie Belle: What happened?\nApple Bloom: What's goin' on?\nDiamond Tiara: It's your cutie marks!

Pinkie Sense?\n[stretching noise]\nRainbow Dash: So, you said you needed our help with something?\nTwilight Sparkle: Follow me.\n\nRainbow Dash: Sweet posters! Is that Smash Fortune?\nTwilight Sparkle: It sure is! When Shining Armor said he wanted to come to the castle and visit, I started collecting things he liked when he was a colt as a surprise!\nPinkie Pie: Surprise?! [nervous laugh]\nTwilight Sparkle: I've been so excited that it's been hard to keep it to myself!\nPinkie Pie: [slightly muffled] I have no idea what that's like!\nFluttershy: Aww, look at the cute little ant farm!\n[ant screeches]\nSpike: And check out all these old comic books!\nTwilight Sparkle: Be careful! They're mint-in-bag!\nSpike: [blowing] [nervous whistling]\nPinkie Pie: What's this?\nTwilight Sparkle: This is Brutus Force. Shining Armor used to carry him around like his baby!\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! [nervous laugh] Really cute! [nervous laugh]\nRarity: It is a bit juvenile for castle d\u00e9cor, but it is very sweet of you.\nFluttershy: I'm sure Shining Armor will love it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Me, too. But there's a few more things I'd like to add before he gets here, and I could really use a hoof collecting them.\nApplejack: Whatever you need, sugarcube, we'll help you get it.\nRest of main cast sans Twilight: [various agreements]\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks, everypony! I just can't wait 'til they walk in and see everything!\nRainbow Dash: Totally understandable. Watching somepony else be surprised with something is almost better than being the one who's getting the surprise!\nPinkie Pie: But... eh... what if the surprise is something so incredibly exciting that a pony can't keep it in any longer, and she has to tell the pony standing next to her what it is or she might explode?!\nFluttershy: I would say... no.\nRarity: The pony who ruins a surprise for somepony else has to live with that guilt forever!\nPinkie Pie: [nervous laugh] Gotta bounce!\n[pinball noises]\n[crash]\nRainbow Dash: So, I know the bar is set pretty high, but does anypony else think Pinkie Pie was acting weirder than usual?\n\n[zoom]\n[door shuts]\nPinkie Pie: [heavy breathing] Phew, that was close! Too close. I almost spilled the beans. Beans that would be really hard to clean up! I obviously can't be around my friends right now. Or anypony for that matter! Hmmm... That's it! If Shining Armor and Cadance are coming tomorrow, then all I have to do is lock myself in my room away from everypony until they arrive! Then I won't ruin anything!\nMr. Cake: Oh, good, you're back! Mrs. Cake needs my help, but these deliveries can't wait! I can't thank you enough for agreeing to be my backup delivery pony, Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie: I... did?\n\nMr. Cake: Maybe I should hire somepony to be my backup delivery pony.\nPinkie Pie: I'll do it!\nMr. Cake: Really?\nPinkie Pie: Sure! There's no possible way that I could ever have anything that might interfere with doing that task, like a gigantic, emotionally exhausting surprise that would make it super hard to be around other ponies.\nMr. Cake: Great! Uh, you're sure you won't change your mind?\nPinkie Pie: No way! Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!\n\nPinkie Pie: Oh, yeah. I Pinkie Promised I'd do it.

I'm starving too! [chewing] [with mouth full] This apple is delicious! [swallows] What are you having, Gummy? Oh, no!

Related or not, it's gonna be a hoot havin' our families together under one roof!\nPinkie Pie: Apples and Pies together again for the first time! Maybe. Unless we're related! Which maybe we're not. I think I just confused myself.\nApplejack: Friends or family, this here's about togetherness.\nApple Bloom: [mouth full] Have you tried the Equestria flag crepes? The blue is blueberry! And don't tell Granny I saw, but her trunk is full of presents!\nApplejack: Now hang on, sugarcube. You know Hearth's Warmin' isn't just about candy and presents, right?\nApple Bloom: Uh-oh. That's your boring sisterly lecture voice.\nGranny Smith: [snoring in background]\nApplejack: 'Fraid so! [clears throat] A long time ago, the Earth ponies, Pegasus ponies, and unicorn ponies weren't friends.\nPinkie Pie: [as unicorn pony] I don't like you! [as Pegasus pony] I don't like you either!\nApplejack: But then, the icy chill of the Windigos almost iced up everythin'. So the ponies decided to work together, and their friendship drove them nasty critters away.\nPinkie Pie: [as Pegasus pony] Beat it, Windigos!\nApplejack: Triumphant, they raised a new flag to celebrate all three tribes, and Equestria was born.\n[biting sound]\nApplejack: Uh, what happened to the flag?\nPinkie Pie: [chewing, with mouth full] I don't know... [swallows, licks]\nApple Bloom: Is that why we celebrate with a flag raisin' tomorrow?\nApplejack: Mm-hmm! And tonight, we'll have the traditional Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner to remember the shared bounties of our ancestors.\nPinkie Pie: We do that too!\nApplejack: Then we'll hang our Hearth's Warmin' dolls over the fireplace to remind us of the warmth shared on that fateful night.\nPinkie Pie: That's what our family does too!\nApplejack: And tomorrow, we open presents!\nPinkie Pie: Ah! We do that too!\nApple Bloom: Sounds like the Apples and the Pies do everything the same way!\nApplejack and Pinkie Pie: [simultaneously] Of course! We might be related! Hey, I was gonna say that! Stop sayin' what I'm sayin'! You stop it first! [beat] [laughing]\n[train whistle blows]\n[train braking]\n[train whistle blows]\nPinkie Pie: I'm so happy, I need to make up a new word for how happy I am. What about... \"rooftastic\"? [squee]\nApplejack: \"Rooftastic\"?\nPinkie Pie: As in, I'm gonna stand on the roof and yell to everypony how rooftastic this is!\n[thump]\nApplejack: What if our families don't like each other?\nPinkie Pie: We are friends, Applejack, and after tonight, our families are gonna be friends too. Do you know what that means? Number of Apples times number of Pies is twenty four, minus my preexisting friendships plus one for Maud and you makes five from twenty four is... [deep breath] nineteen new friendships! Maud! [squeals]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I'm so excited to see you, Pinkie Pie. You too, Applejack. I hope you had fun sledding yesterday.\nApplejack: How'd you know that?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Isn't it obvious? There are specks of extrusive andesite on your hoof. It's a mountain rock.\nGranny Smith: [hushed] Oh, she's good.\nPinkie Pie: How's school going?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] If you thought quartz was high on the Mohs hardness scale, wait 'til I tell you about corundum.\nPinkie Pie: I missed you so much!\nApple family: Mm-hmm.\n\nApplejack: This place looks amazin'!\nPinkie Pie: Come on, everypony! Meet my super-mega-fun-derful family! Everypony, meet everypony!\nIgneous Rock: Surely thy name is not but Granny Smith. I am called Igneous Rock Pie, son of Feldspar Granite Pie.\nCloudy Quartz: Thou shalt know me as Cloudy Quartz.\nIgneous Rock: May Providence favor thee well, and to thou comfort our humble homestead bring.\nGranny Smith: Y'all gabbin' with words real funny-like. Wh-wh-what'd you say them names were? \"Iggy\"? And I'm just gonna call you \"Big Mama Q\"!\nLimestone Pie: Gaze into the eyes of Limestone Pie. Ma and Pa may own this rock farm, but I keep it running. Cross me and\u2014\nPinkie Pie: Aye aye, Captain Grumpy! No one's gonna mess with your precious mine!\nLimestone Pie: Or Holder's Boulder!\nPinkie Pie: [sighs] Everypony stay away from Holder's Boulder. There, you happy now?\nApplejack: And you must be\u2014\nPinkie Pie: This is Marble Pie, my baby sister who's only a few minutes younger than me but she'll always be a baby to me, isn't that right? She's so excited to meet everypony! Oh, and she wishes you all a happy Hearth's Warming!\n[beat]\nMarble Pie: Mm-hmm.\nApplejack: [hushed, to Apple Bloom] Guess Pinkie Pie always did the talkin' for her.\nApple Bloom: [giggles]\nPinkie Pie: [whistles] Attention!\nLimestone Pie: What'd I say about the boulder?!\nPinkie Pie: I'll just be a second. Everypony get settled in! There's plenty of room upstairs. And then it's time for Hearth's Warming Eve dinner!\n[confetti exploding]\nApplejack: [hushed] So far, so good, cousin!\nPinkie Pie: Hee-hee!\n\n[bed springs bouncing]\nApple Bloom: Oh, I can't wait to taste their fresh sweet rolls! They're my favorite part of Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner.\nGranny Smith: I'm more of a six-layer bean dip filly myself!\nApple Bloom: I love that too! Oh, Applejack, do you think theirs'll be even better than ours?\nApplejack: Well, that's a mighty tall order, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least.\nPinkie Pie: Are you excited for dinner time? Because guess who is! Spoiler alert \u2013 it's me!\n[soup pouring]\n[splash]\nApplejack: What about hot rolls and mulled cider and double-baked pot pie?\nGranny Smith: Uh, what about six-layer bean dip?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] We have rock soup.\nPinkie Pie: Potato, po-tah-to. Double-baked pot pie, rock soup! Dinner is dinner. Am I right or am I right?\n[beat]\nApplejack: Yeah, um, you know what? This is what we were expectin'! Right, everypony?\nBig McIntosh and Granny Smith: [uncertain noises]\nApplejack: [laughs nervously]\n\nPinkie Pie: [slurping, exhales] Is everything all right, Applejack?\nApplejack: O' course, I'm just being a rusty fiddle. Tune me up and let's get back to dinner. [slurping] [gag, coughs]\nPinkie Pie: More rock, please!\n[soup pouring]\nPinkie Pie: Eat up, so we can get to our Hearth's Warming dolls!\nApplejack: Now that's somethin' I know all about!\n\n[picking noises]\nPinkie Pie: Who wants a Hearth's Warming doll?\nApplejack: Are you sayin' that rock is a Hearth's Warmin' doll?\nPinkie Pie: Don't be silly, silly!\n[picking noise]\n[crumbling]\nPinkie Pie: Our dolls are these little pieces! Isn't that right, Marble Pie?\n[beat]\nMarble Pie: Mm-hmm.\n[picking noises]\nApple Bloom: Our dolls are... rocks?\n[snap]\n[crunch]\nApplejack: Uh... y'all don't have traditional crocheted dolls passed down in your family?\nPinkie Pie: Aww, you're just a frown factory because you got a weird rock. Cheer up! I'm sure you'll do great in the flag finding mission!\nApplejack: The what findin' what now?\n\nPinkie Pie: Limestone Pie, you're the judge! Big Mac, Marble Pie, you're team one! Apple Bloom and Maud, you're team two! Ma, Pa, you're gonna be with Granny Smith. Don't think of it as team old. Think of it as team three! And I'm with Applejack of course, since we might be cousins!\nApplejack: So now that we're all split up, mind tellin' us what we're doin'?\nPinkie Pie: As everypony knows\u2014\nLimestone Pie: Stay off Holder's Boulder!\nPinkie Pie: Sheesh. When the three tribes united to form Equestria, the first flag was sewn by Nimble Thimble. It's tradition to raise a flag on Hearth's Warming to celebrate that famous day.\nOther ponies: [general agreement]\nPinkie Pie: But who gets to put the flag on Holder's Boulder?\nApplejack: You mean on the flagpole?\nPinkie Pie: No, silly, it goes on the highest point! And who's the lucky pony?\nApplejack: Traditionally, it's the youngest\u2014\nPinkie Pie: [quickly] On your marks, get set, go!\nApplejack: Pinkie Pie, will you please tell us what's goin' on?\nPinkie Pie: I'll explain on the way!\nApplejack: [yelps]\n\nApplejack: I still don't understand.\nPinkie Pie: Earlier today, Limestone Pie hid an obsidian stone. Whoever finds it gets to raise the flag!\nApplejack: It's all just so... complicated, and... rock-based.\nPinkie Pie: Well, how else would we do it?\nApplejack: I don't know. I sure hope everypony else is havin' a better time.\n\nMarble Pie: Mm-hmm.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nMarble Pie: Mm-hmm.\nBig McIntosh: Eeeeeeeeeyup.\n\nGranny Smith: So, how'd you meet this Iggy feller?\nCloudy Quartz: We were chosen by the Pairing Stone and betrothed within a fortnight.\nIgneous Rock: The choosing stone decreed, \"Thou shalt love one another.\" And lo, it was so.\nGranny Smith: Hoo-wee, I gots to look into this oldfangled choosin' stone thing. You reckon it knows any apple-farmin' hunks?\nIgneous Rock: Indeed so.\nCloudy Quartz: [simultaneously] Mmm.\n\nApple Bloom: What does the rock look like?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] It looks like something that formed when volcanic lava cooled quickly.\nApple Bloom: Oh.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Have you ever wished you could turn into a rock?\nApple Bloom: I had a dream once I was an apple.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] We have a lot in common when it comes to thinking about turning into things.\n\nPinkie Pie: Found it, found it, found it!\nApplejack: A picture? I've been lookin' for a real stone, Pinkie Pie!\nPinkie Pie: Um, that would be weird. Do you know what this means? I get to raise the flag, and now it's time to hide the presents!\nApplejack: Y'all hide your presents?\nPinkie Pie: Of course! What's more fun than getting a present? Finding a present! Although, most years, nopony finds one.\nApplejack: So nopony gets presents?\nPinkie Pie: Eh, not usually.\nApplejack: So lemme get all this straight. You're only allowed to eat rock soup for dinner, then the pony who finds this rock gets to raise the flag, but not really 'cause you don't got no flagpole, and to top it off, you don't even get presents?!\nPinkie Pie: Well, it doesn't sound very fun when you say it that way.\nApplejack: Well, how 'bout you picture this? Both our families, openin' presents, raisin' the flag...?\nPinkie Pie: Picturing it... Loving it...!\n\nPinkie Pie: Goodnight, everypony!\nApplejack: Goodnight, Pinkie Pie! [hushed] We've gotta do somethin', y'all! Pinkie Pie's family never had a real Hearth's Warmin'!\nGranny Smith: Is that really what she said?\nApplejack: Well, I-I'm sure it's what she meant.\nApple Bloom: These are their traditions.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nApplejack: [sighs] I know they have their traditions and we have ours, but I just want them to see how much better theirs could be.\n\n[rooster crows]\nPinkie Pie: Hearth's Warming!\n[thump]\nPinkie Pie: Hearth's Warming, Hearth's Warming! Hearth's Warming, Hearth's Warming! Hearth's Warming, Hearth's\u2014 [strangles out]\nIgneous Rock: Oh, my. Oh, my.\nLimestone Pie: What. Happened. To. My. Farm!\nApplejack: It's Hearth's Warmin', Apple-style! We've been doin' everythin' your way, I thought we could mix it up a bit! Marble Pie, you could raise the Equestria flag up this pole, because you're the youngest Pie! Ma and Pa Pie, we'll cook you up a meal you'll never forget! And look, we all get presents without havin' to find 'em!\nPinkie Pie: ...Yeah, this is gonna be great! All the stuff she's said. Right, everypony?\nIgneous Rock: Pinkamena Diane Pie! Truly thou cannot favor this madness!\nPinkie Pie: Well, I wanna be one big family!\nLimestone Pie: But what about what we usually do?!\nPinkie Pie: I, um, well, I-I don't know! [tearing up] Don't make me choose!\nApplejack: I didn't mean to cause a fuss... Why don't we just open presents around the flag pole? It'll be fun, you'll see!\nMaud Pie: Excuse me. You planted your pole on a fault line.\n[rumbling, cracking, thud]\nLimestone Pie: Nooooooooooooooo!\n[crunch]\nApplejack: Oh, boy.\n\n[bell ringing]\nPinkie Pie: You didn't have to ask them to leave!\nLimestone Pie: They wanted to go! We don't need anypony forcing their way into our family!\nPinkie Pie: This was all a misunderstanding, everypony! I know Applejack, and she'd never do anything bad to anypony!\nLimestone Pie: Look around, Pinkie Pie! It's gonna take me ages to get this rock farm back on track! And how are we gonna lift Holder's Boulder?! This is all her fault!\nPinkie Pie: Then it's my fault too...\n\n[thud]\nGranny Smith: Prob'ly best if we head back to Sweet Apple Acres. Maybe in time we'll be friends again, but for the now it's best if we give them a little space.\nApple Bloom: I wish we didn't have to. I really like Maud. She's sweet once you get to know her. They all are. Worst Hearth's Warmin' ever.\nGranny Smith: Eh, has anypony seen Applejack?\n\nApplejack: [sniffling] I really cracked the corn this time.\nPinkie Pie: [sniffling] I really popped the pi\u00f1ata this time.\nApplejack: Pinkie Pie?\nPinkie Pie: [yelps] What are you doing here?\nApplejack: What are you doin' here?\nApplejack and Pinkie Pie: [simultaneously] I came here to think! You did? So did I! [laughing] Aww.\nApplejack: I'm too ashamed to go back up there. Your family, my family, they all must think I'm such a nincompoop.\nPinkie Pie: Aw, no one thinks that! Pushy, aggressive, mean... Oh, I'm not helping. Sorry.\nApplejack: I'm sorry I forced my traditions over yours. I don't want you to have to choose between the family you were born into and the friends who love you like one. I really hoped we could be one big happy family. I guess not.\nPinkie Pie: Don't say that!\n[train whistle blows]\nApplejack: I wish I could stay, but I have a train to catch.\nPinkie Pie: [crying] H-Ha... Happy Hearth's Warming.\nApplejack: [tearing up] You too.\n\n[train noises]\nGranny Smith: You want to know why Holder's Boulder's so danged important? [exhales] Well, now their great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Holder Cobblestone \u2013 he found that boulder in a dragon's nest, older than time itself! He built the family farm around it, even though it was just an ordinary rock. It always brought them good luck.\nApplejack: Aw, crickets! That is important! I got so caught up in the things they were doin', I never asked why they did 'em!\n[smack]\nApplejack: [reading] To Applejack, from Pinkie Pie. Cousins forever.\nApple Bloom: You just found your first Pie Hearth's Warmin' present ever!\nApplejack: [laughing] Only Pinkie Pie could hide a present on a movin' train. ...What a great tradition. [beat] Stop the train!\n\nPie family: [straining]\nPinkie Pie: [straining] Come on... you... boulder, come on... agh!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I'm pushing as hard as I can too.\nPie family: [straining]\nLimestone Pie: Rrrgh, it's hopeless!\nApplejack: Need a little help?\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] Apples!\nLimestone Pie: What do you want?!\nApplejack: I wasn't tryin' to take your traditions away, I was tryin' to share ours. I was so focused on us bein' one big happy family, I thought we needed the same traditions right away. What I should've done was learn about yours and teach you about ours. And over time, we'd make new traditions together. I'm sorry, y'all.\n[beat]\nLimestone Pie: Well, don't just stand there! We got a boulder to move! And I'm in charge.\nApple family and Pie family: [straining]\nPinkie Pie: I think we've just invented our first combined tradition! Pushing Holder's Boulder out of the quarry! [squeals] I can't wait for Applejack to knock it over next Hearth's Warming!\nApple family and Pie family: [laughing]\n\nApple Bloom: [swallows]\nPinkie Pie: Marble Pie, you want to wish Big Mac a happy Hearth's Warming, don't you! And you too, right, Big Mac?\nMarble Pie: Mm-hmm!\nBig McIntosh: [short giggle] Eeyup.\nGranny Smith: Eh, lemme see here, uh... 'If thou ask-eth me, uh, thou two art, eh, okay-eth in my book'.\nIgneous Rock: 'Yee-haw'.\n[paper ripping]\nPinkie Pie: Happy Hearth's Warming!\nApplejack: Happy Hearth's Warmin', Pinkie Pie.\nApple Bloom: Attention, everypony! Maud wants to sing some Hearth's Warmin' carols that she wrote!\nApple family and Pie family: [various cheers]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] The first one is about rocks. They're all about rocks. [reading, deadpan] Hearth's Warming is great. Like calcium silicate. What a wonderful day.

It's Nightmare Night, remember?\nFluttershy: How could I forget? Oh, I don't suppose I could borrow a few pieces of hay from you? I forgot to stock up on food for Angel, and you do seem to have quite a lot.\nGranny Smith: We need it for the Apple Family Haunted Maze. [spooky voice] The scariest maze that there ever was. Who knows what lurks inside?\nFluttershy: Oh, I'm sure I don't.\nGranny Smith: Is that a mummified pony that just leaped out at ya?\nFluttershy: I don't know. Is it?\nGranny Smith: And what's that crunchin' sound beneath yer hooves? Maybe it's the bones of ponies that didn't make it out alive!\nFluttershy: B-B-B-B-Bones?!\nGranny Smith: And are those peeled grapes or a thousand slimy eyeballs starin' at ya from beyond the grave?\nFluttershy: Please tell me they're grapes!\nGranny Smith: Oh, I'll never tell.

It's Nightmare Night and you're here and not holed up in your cottage! Does this mean what I think it means?\nFluttershy: That I foolishly forgot to stock up on food for Angel and had to go out to get him something but got spooked in town so I came here hoping Twilight had some lettuce I could give him?\nSpike: Oh. I thought maybe you decided to come out with us tonight.\nFluttershy: Goodness, no! I couldn't be out tonight. I just couldn't.\nSpike: Technically speaking, you already are out right now.\nFluttershy: Oh. I guess that is true.\nSpike: So what if you stayed out a little longer with your friends? I know they'd be super excited.\nFluttershy: You think so?\nSpike: You would make them so happy if you joined in. They wouldn't believe their eyes!

Is everything okay?\nFluttershy: Everything is fine. In fact, it's more than fine. I've decided to join you in your Nightmare Night festivities.\nRainbow Dash: [scoffs] Seriously? You? Out? Tonight?\nFluttershy: Every Nightmare Night, I shut myself in my cottage and refuse to come out until morning. But it's just like when I was afraid to sing in front of anypony. If I hadn't given it a try, I never would've found out how much I enjoy it.\nApplejack: And we'd have missed out on how great you sound.\nRarity: Fluttershy with us on Nightmare Night? Why, that's positively the most wonderful news I've heard in ages!\nPinkie Pie: You can get dressed up in a costume with us and play Nightmare Night games with us and eat candy apples with us!\nApplejack: Don't forget the best part. Goin' through my family's corn maze!\nPinkie Pie: [squee]\nFluttershy: Oh, right. The maze.\nApplejack: Uh, only if you're up for it.\nFluttershy: Oh, I am!

No. Headless pony? No. Vampire fruit bat? Ugh, definitely no. You see, Fluttershy, the beauty of Nightmare Night is that you don't have to dress up as something scary.\n[smack]\nRarity: Ooh! Yes. This one will look gorgeous on you. Period costumes are all the rage this year. What? No good?\nFluttershy: What if we encounter something terrifying and need to get away quickly? All those layers could slow me down, or worse, make me trip!\nRarity: Oh. I never... considered that. Never fear!\n[smack]\nRarity: [hums] Ooh, now this is a real stunner! I call it \"Masquerade\"! Just a simple black dress underneath but with this ornately decorated mask!\nFluttershy: A mask?\nRarity: No?\nFluttershy: They can just be so difficult to see out of.\nRarity: Yes, but this one has eyeholes.\nFluttershy: W-What about being able to see what's to the left or right of me?\nRarity: I suppose your vision would be somewhat obscured. It's your first Nightmare Night out and about, and we do want you to be comfortable.\nFluttershy: What if I just wear the dress?\nRarity: Oh, sure, dear. That's... fine. [to herself] It's so plain, it's frightening. [out loud] Oh, my! Look at all of you!

Without the mask.\n[bonk]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, that's great! Isn't it great?\nRainbow Dash: Oh, yeah.\nPinkie Pie: So creative.\nApplejack: Great costume.\n\nPinkie Pie: I figured I'd save the really scary games for next year when Fluttershy's more used to it.\nMain cast sans Rainbow Dash: Round and round and round you go, where you stop nopony knows!\nPinkie Pie: Okay... go!\nRainbow Dash: [grunting] Good luck beating that, Fluttershy!\nFluttershy: Well, um, it's just that if I'm blindfolded and somepony were to leap out in front of me, I'd never have the chance to defend myself.\nRarity: That's fine, darling. You don't have to do anything you don't want to.\nTwilight Sparkle: We're just glad you're here.\nPinkie Pie: We don't have to finish that game. I have another one I know you'll love!

What happens if, when my head is deep down in the water, some kind of scary monster appears? How would I even hear to know I was under attack?\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: Time for candy!\nFluttershy: It is?\nPinkie Pie: I made candy bags. Each bag has been made with each of you in mind, complete with each of your favorite candies!\nRainbow Dash: Ha! Awesome!\nPinkie Pie: Here. Take it. Take it! What are you waiting for?\nFluttershy: Well, it's just... What if when I'm eating one of these chewy taffies, my mouth becomes glued shut and I can't scream for help?\n[beat]\nFluttershy: Oh, goodness. We've only just started to celebrate Nightmare Night together, and I'm already taking all the fun out of it, aren't I?\nPinkie Pie: You're not taking out all of the fun.\nRainbow Dash: Just, like, ninety per\u2014\n[clang]\nRainbow Dash: ...Some of it.\nFluttershy: I really wanna do this. But there's just so many things that terrify me about tonight. I couldn't possibly predict what might upset me.\nTwilight Sparkle: Unless... you were the one doing the scaring!\nRainbow Dash: Her scaring us? [laughing] Oh. You're being serious.\nTwilight Sparkle: The thing you hate is being scared, but if you're the one doing the scaring, then...\nFluttershy: Then I can help you all have fun and I can still be a part of Nightmare Night!\nTwilight Sparkle: So you like that idea?\nFluttershy: I think I do! And I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I think I have the perfect idea for how I'm gonna do it!\nPinkie Pie: Really?

Don't be scared of what awaits you. Go on. Pass the sugar. Oh, no! There is none! You're a terrible host! Rarity, put your coat on!\nRarity: Why would I do that?\nFluttershy: [spooky voice] You need to cover up because no one has complimented your dressssssss! Pinkie Pie, look to your left and ask your best friend to pass the cucumber sandwiches!\nPinkie Pie: Huh? I can't. There's nopony there.\nFluttershy: [spooky voice] That's right. Because she didn't care to show uuuuuup.\nPinkie Pie: What?\nFluttershy: [spooky voice] A friend who didn't come through. That must scare you to the coooore. Quick, everypony, look behind you!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, what are those?\nFluttershy: [spooky voice] They're unplanned guests. Your woooorst nightmare. You don't have enough food for them! Oh, no! There's a tiny kitten that needs a home! But you are over-scheduled right now. You don't have time to help! I said, \"You don't have time to help!\" This should appear to scare you! [normal voice] Why don't you look terrified? You showed up to a party and everypony was extremely disappointed in you. Can you imagine anything more upsetting?\nRarity: It was a really good try, darling, but the scares at Nightmare Night are of an entirely different nature.\nTwilight Sparkle: It was really creative, though. I never would have thought of... all this.\n[thunk]\nFluttershy: Oh, I'm just not cut out for this. Just go on without me.\nRarity: Oh, no. We couldn't possibly.\nFluttershy: You have to. This is the night you look forward to all year.\nPinkie Pie: We could... stay here?\nFluttershy: It's okay. I really want you all to have fun. This is how I spend every Nightmare Night. Please go. I'll be fine.\nPinkie Pie: Eh, it's funny. I actually thought she had an idea for something really scary for a second there.\nApplejack: She definitely tried her hardest.\n[door closes]\nFluttershy: I did try my hardest.\nAngel: [thumping on table]\nFluttershy: Or... maybe not. I suppose I could have gone with something a bit scarier. You're right! I've been taking baby steps! I think it's time for grown up ones! I don't suppose you have any ideas how I could do that?\nAngel: [growls mischievously]\n\nApplejack: Everypony's linin' up for the corn maze, y'all! Let's go!\nSpike: Oh, yeah! I can't believe we're finally doin' this!\n[horse whinny]\nMain cast sans Fluttershy: [scream] [laugh]\nRainbow Dash: It's a good thing Fluttershy isn't here because she would never be able to handle this!\n\n[distant screams]\nMain cast sans Fluttershy: [gasp]\nBig McIntosh: Boooo... Eeyup.\nMain cast sans Fluttershy: [laugh]\n[crackling]\nRarity: What. Is. That. Sound?\nPinkie Pie: It looks like... bones!\nMain cast sans Fluttershy: [scream]\nRainbow Dash: Looks like a bunch of dried sticks painted white to me.\nApplejack: Hey, try to keep up the illusion, would ya?\nRarity and Spike: Gah!\nMain cast sans Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie: [laugh]\nPinkie Pie: Eeew!\n[whoosh]\nApplejack: Agh! What was that?\nSpike: Don't you know?\nApplejack: Uh, o-of course I do. It was, uh...\n[ghostly moans]\n[peeyow!]\nMain cast sans Fluttershy: [scream]\n[moaning continues]\nRarity: [grunts] Fluttershy had a point with the layers on the dress.\n[moaning continues]\nApplejack: [exclaims]\nMain cast sans Fluttershy: [yell]\n[thud]\nMain cast sans Fluttershy: [groan]\nRarity: What is this? Is it a tunnel? Where does it lead?!\n[grinding]\n[slam]\nTwilight Sparkle: Which way are we supposed to go now?!\nApplejack: Uh, I don't know! I don't know what's goin' on!\nRainbow Dash: [grunts] What do you mean? Didn't you help plan this?\n[creaking chair]\nApplejack: Whew. There's Granny Smith. Not that I was ever scared, 'cause I wasn't. I'm a pretty good actress when I wanna be. Granny? [screams]\nMain cast sans Fluttershy: [scream] [panting]\n[crash]\nSpike: Applejack, didn't you know about any of this?!\nApplejack: Alright, I got to admit I didn't know about any of this, but maybe they're just tryin' to make it interestin' for me, too! I'm sure Granny Smith or Big Mac is behind this.\nGranny Smith: [muffled] Are those peeled grapes or eyeballs starin' at ya from beyond the grave? [cackling]\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [playful scream]\nApplejack: [teeth chatter] That's what we were supposed to do! I don't know why we're down here! This is really scarin' me now!\nPinkie Pie: [teeth chattering]\n[foot stomps]\nMonster: [growls]\nPinkie Pie: How did that get down here?!\nMonster: [roars]\nRainbow Dash: RUUUUUUUUUN!\nPinkie Pie and Spike: [panting] [grunt]\nPinkie Pie: I can't see!\nMain cast sans Fluttershy: [grunting]\nRainbow Dash: I can barely move! It's like glue!\nMonster: [roaring]\nTwilight Sparkle: [grunts]\n[teleportation zap]\nMonster: [growls]\nMain cast sans Fluttershy: [panicked screams]\nFlutterbat: [deep cackles] [snarls]\nMain cast sans Fluttershy: [whimpering]\nFluttershy: Oh, my! I'm so, so sorry. Can you ever forgive me?\nApplejack: Fluttershy?\nRainbow Dash: It was you the whole time?!\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't believe it!\nRarity: That... was...\nPinkie Pie: THE BEST THING EVER! [squee]\nRainbow Dash: It was way more terrifying than the most terrifying thing I could have thought of!\nApplejack: You out-nightmared the scariest part of the corn maze!\nTwilight Sparkle: How did you do all this?!\nFluttershy: After you left, I realized that I wasn't ready to give up on Nightmare Night. So I asked Granny Smith if I could try to make the maze even scarier for my friends.\nRainbow Dash: You came up with all of this?\nFluttershy: I had some help. Angel was the scary figure that kept scurrying after you in the maze. Fuzzy Legs made the sticky wall that made it difficult for you to see and move. And, of course, Harry was the especially scary monster.\nHarry: [growls happily]\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow! That was inspired!\nPinkie Pie: You have to do this every year!\nApplejack: Uh-huh!\nRarity: Absolutely!\nTwilight Sparkle: Every year!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah!\nFluttershy: We could celebrate Nightmare Night together every year. But the truth is I really don't want to.\nPinkie Pie: You don't?!\nRarity: But you've done it. You found a way that we can all have a fabulous time together.\nFluttershy: Yes, but I've also realized something. You all may love Nightmare Night and I may be good at being a part of it, but it's no fun for me to see my friends feel like they're in danger, even if I know they're not. I really don't like it. It's just not my cup of tea.\nPinkie Pie: Spoooooooooky tea?\nFluttershy: No. Just regular tea. We do lots of fun things together, but I'm afraid this just isn't gonna be one of them. Actually, I'm not afraid. I'm perfectly fine with it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Then we are, too.\nHarry: [growls happily]\n[bats squeaking]\n\nFluttershy: [sighs] I don't know why I doubted myself for a second. Now this is what I call a perfect Nightmare Night.\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nSpike: [sighs] Didn't we just shelve all the books in the library a few months ago?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, but that was because we needed to! This is just because I want to! I call it my \"book-sort-cation\"! Three uninterrupted days of reorganizing books. Can you think of anything more relaxing?\nSpike: Well, claw massages, back rubs, bubble baths... You weren't really looking for an answer, were you?\nTwilight Sparkle: I've even devised a better system for organizing them. It decreases the amount of time it takes to find a book you're looking for by nearly three quarters of a second!\nSpike: [flatly] Whoa. That much?\nTwilight Sparkle: Look at them all. Why, there must be at least twenty thousand books to organize!\nOwlowiscious: [hoots]\nTwilight Sparkle: Best long weekend ever! I'm sure we can make some time for a claw massage and a back rub too.\nSpike: Yes! Best long weekend ever!\n\n[theme song]\n\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: [exhales]\nSpike: Whoa! That strange yellow orb in the sky! What is that?\nTwilight Sparkle: Alright, alright, so it's been a little while since we've seen the sun.\nSpike: A little while? We've been in that library for three straight days!\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, but they were three very productive days! Even if you did take that two-hour claw massage break.\nSpike: Hey, you promise a claw massage, I'm getting a claw massage.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's not like we missed anything.\n[crash]\nRainbow Dash and Discord: Hello, Twilight! Hi, Spike!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hi, Rainbow Dash. Good to see you, Discord.\nSpike: Did you rehearse before you found us?\nRainbow Dash and Discord: What makes you think we practiced?\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on, Rainbow Dash. What's going on here?\nRainbow Dash: [laughing] Sorry. Me and Discord are just messin' around. Like we do.\nTwilight Sparkle: Since when?\nDiscord: Oh, Twilight. We simply had a momentous time together these past three days. You could say it was... \"hiss-terical\"! [laughs]\nRainbow Dash: [laughing] Sneaky snake!\nDiscord: [laughing] Just snaking around!\nRainbow Dash: Good one, Discord! [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: It is?\nRainbow Dash: Kind of an inside joke from this weekend. You wouldn't really get it unless you were there.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. Okay.\nRainbow Dash: Cool. Well, uh, catch you later, Twilight!\nDiscord: [laughing] Catch you later, Twilight.\n[whirling]\n[magic zap]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: That was strange, right? Since when have Rainbow Dash and Discord had inside jokes?\nSpike: Since sometime in the last three days, I guess.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey! Nopony made you join me on my book-sort-cation.\nSpike: I'm jokin', I'm jokin'!\n\n[door opens, bell rings]\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity?\nRarity: [gasps] Twilight! You've returned from your book sorting sabbatical! All that organizing has done wonders for your complexion!\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks! It was very relaxing. And we were able to clear a shelf for those old-fashioned books you wanted to donate.\nRarity: Oh, pfft, they're not old, darling. They're vintage, and they're over there! I've even included my favorites by former Canterlot designer to the stars Rococo Froufrou!\nSpike: Oh, I love her!\nRarity: Him.\nSpike: [laughs nervously] Both.\nDiscord: Twilight! This makes twice I'm seeing you in one day! Aren't I lucky?\nTwilight Sparkle: Weren't you just with\u2014\nFluttershy: Hi, Twilight! Hi, Spike! How was your book-sort-cation?\nTwilight Sparkle: It was good!\nFluttershy: [giggles] Orange you glad you did it?\nFluttershy, Rarity, and Discord: [laughing]\nRarity: [within laughter] \"Orange you glad\"! Oh, Fluttershy, you're a card! [laughing]\nFluttershy: Oh, please. You'll make me blush.\nDiscord: You do seem to be turning a shade of... [gasps] orange!\nFluttershy and Rarity: [laughing]\nRarity: Oh, sorry, darling. You see, we were at Sweet Apple Acres and, uh, ooh, how to explain...\nDiscord: Well, let me try and paint her a picture, dearest.\nSpike: [to himself] \"Dearest\"?\nDiscord: [imitating Bob Ross] You see, we were all at Sweet Apple Acres, and I ended up turning the trees into the most\u2014 [normal] Oh, who am I kidding? I simply can't do it justice. You really had to be there.\nFluttershy: We would've invited you to come along too, but we didn't want to interrupt your organizing. We know how important it is to you.\nDiscord: And I'm sure it was much more important than the fun that we had. [laughs]\nTwilight Sparkle: I appreciate that... Speaking of books, I should get these on the shelves.\nFluttershy and Rarity: [laughing]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmm. Rainbow Dash bonding with Discord, Rarity finding something he did genuinely funny... Must've been some weekend.\nSpike: Somepony sorry she missed it?\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course not.\nApplejack and Pinkie Pie: [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: What's got you two in hysterics?\nDiscord: [gulps] Oh, we were just reminiscing about the best weekend ever!\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] He's everywhere today, isn't he?\nDiscord: Oh, now where was I? Ah, yes, we had just finished our soup, and then Applejack said, [imitating Applejack] \"Peanut butter hoof? Yuck, not even with jelly!\"\nApplejack and Pinkie Pie: [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Eh, I don't get it.\nPinkie Pie: [laughing] It was hilarious! I wish we'd taken a picture for you!\nDiscord: Oh, well, this should do!\n[tapping]\nApplejack and Pinkie Pie: [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: I guess that's funny?\nDiscord: Well, seems this has become quite the... sticky situation! [laughing]\nApplejack and Pinkie Pie: [laughing]\nPinkie Pie: [within laughter] Sticky situation!\nApplejack: Aw, shucks, Twilight. We haven't even asked how your weekend went.\nTwilight Sparkle: It was fine!\nDiscord: And yet you look so glum. Does somepony need a huggy-wuggy? [babying noises]\n[sproing, sproing]\nTwilight Sparkle: I am not glum. I'm glad! I'm glad you all had such a good time together. Having inside jokes can really create a lasting bond between friends.\nDiscord: I'm just sorry that all this bonding happened while you were holed up in your castle.\nApplejack: Heh. Oh, don't you worry about Twilight. Bet you were in hog heaven organizin' all them books. Again.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sure I had just as much fun as the rest of you.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't believe I missed out on all that bonding!\nSpike: [gulps] I knew it! You are jealous!\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, I'm the Princess of Friendship. I don't get jealous. I'm sorry I missed out because sharing that experience would've helped me with my Princess of Friendship duties!\nSpike: [chewing] [mouth full] Come again?\nTwilight Sparkle: If our friends could enjoy three full days with Discord that much, it must have something to do with the specific things they did together! If we could find out what those things were, it could be a real breakthrough in the science of friendship!\nSpike: Hm. I guess so.\n[magic zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: I know so! You thought our book-sort-cation was fun? This is gonna be even better!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you for coming. I wouldn't have asked you here if it wasn't important.\nPinkie Pie: I love important!\nTwilight Sparkle: I want to know how these funny moments you shared came to pass. I can use this data to help advance friendships all over Equestria.\nApplejack: Well, I like the sound of that!\nFluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity: [general agreement]\nTwilight Sparkle: Perfect. Let's start with the snake.\nRainbow Dash and Discord: [laughing]\nRainbow Dash: I don't know if I can get it out! It's too funny!\nDiscord: Oh, but we must! It's for the greater good! It started when we were helping Granny Smith with her garden...\n[flashback music starts]\nApplejack: Uh, I reckon you mean my sister Apple Bloom.\nDiscord: Eh... All you Apples look the same. And then Rainbow Dash saw a snake!\nFluttershy: I think it was a garden hose.\nRainbow Dash: It was a hose snake. Super deadly.\nApplejack: I recall it bein' a large stick that looked like a hose that, in turn, did in fact resemble a snake.\nPinkie Pie: Point is, we galloped away.\nRainbow Dash: And it chased after us!\nTwilight Sparkle: The hose? A snake? A stick?\nRainbow Dash: A snake!\nFluttershy: A hose!\nApplejack: A stick!\nDiscord: We literally trotted for our lives. Isn't that hilarious?\nFluttershy: I guess you had to be there.\nTwilight Sparkle: I do need to be there.\nRarity: But you weren't! And it's already happened! Ooh, are you suggesting...\nPinkie Pie: Time travel?!\n[Back to the Future theme plays]\nTwilight Sparkle: Absolutely not! Time travel is not something to be messed with. We simply need to recreate everything that led to these jokes.\nDiscord: Oh, what a brilliant idea! Shall we begin with the lunch date that kicked off the glorious weekend you missed out on?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Are you sure it was this table?\nRainbow Dash: Uh, does it really matter?\nTwilight Sparkle: When it comes to science, everything matters. One change to the equation could ruin the experiment.\nDiscord: Ohhhhhh... it was this table here.\nTwilight Sparkle: Alright, so you sat down at the table, and then what happened?\nRarity: Oh, well, first I expressed my displeasure with the design of the menu. It\u2014\nDiscord: I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just noticed something.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes?\nDiscord: The tablecloth. It isn't the same color as the one the restaurant used on the day in question.\nTwilight Sparkle: ...Really?\nRarity: He's right! The tablecloth was red! I remember because it clashed with the font on the menus.\nApplejack: I don't suppose that means we're gonna need to get a new tablecloth, does it?\nDiscord: Oh, most definitely.\n[magic sparkles]\nFluttershy: Ooh.\nPinkie Pie: Wowee!\nDiscord: One change to the equation could ruin the experiment. Twilight said so herself. Anything stand out as being different? Anything at all?\nFluttershy: Um, I've noticed a couple of things.\nPinkie Pie: Me too!\nDiscord: Excellent!\n[magic zap]\n\nDiscord: A little to the left! No, my left! A little bit more... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, a little more right!\nPinkie Pie: The cloud over our table looked like an ice cream sundae!\n[stretching]\nPinkie Pie: Perfect!\n\n[slide whistle ascending and descending]\nDiscord: No-no-no-no-no, this is barely room temperature! Gar\u00e7on! Gar\u00e7on, over here!\n\n[tapping]\nMain cast sans Twilight Sparkle: [laughing]\nDiscord: No? Nothing?\nTwilight Sparkle: Are you sure there's not something you've missed? Some other detail about your lunch together that you're forgetting?\nDiscord: Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I feel we've been pretty exhaustive in our attempts to recreate every single detail of our previous encounter.\nMane cast sans Twilight Sparkle: [general agreement]\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, Twilight. If you don't get it by now, I don't think you're ever gonna get it.\nTwilight Sparkle: But it is really important that I figure this out. It's for the good of all Equestria!\n[ticker tape machine whirring]\nDiscord: Well, perhaps we should have another look at the data we've collected. [gasps] Of course! There is one last variable that we haven't accounted for.\nTwilight Sparkle: What?\nDiscord: You!\nTwilight Sparkle: Me?\nDiscord: You weren't there observing us. No matter how hard we try, we can't possibly recreate our weekend of fun exactly as it happened because you'll always be watching, and you weren't there.\nMain cast sans Twilight Sparkle: Hmmm.\nPinkie Pie: He makes a good point.\nDiscord: It has only served to prove that moments of levity and bonding between friends simply cannot be recreated so that others might share in the experience.\nPinkie Pie: He makes another good point!\nRarity: Oh, don't worry, darling. I'm sure there'll be plenty of other chances for you to share in the kind of [starts giggling] frivolity we had with Discord while you were away.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, and I'll bet they'll be just as hissssss-terical! [laughing]\nDiscord: [laughing]\nFluttershy: [laughing] Absolutely.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm not buying it. Not for a second. There is definitely something else going on here, Spike!\nSpike: [gulps] Or maybe there isn't, and you should just drop this whole thing and admit that you're a little jealous!\nTwilight Sparkle: Even if I'm not able to laugh at what happened, I should be able to figure out why they find it funny. Why they think they had this amazing and hilarious time together. But I can't figure it out! It doesn't make sense!\nSpike: Some things just can't be explained.\nTwilight Sparkle: Our friends think something great happened to them while I was away, but no. It was something awful! If we don't break the spell they're under, who knows what terrible things could happen?!\nSpike: Spell?\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on, Spike! There's no time to lose!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Zecora, what do you think? Can you undo Discord's magic?\n[powder falling, cauldron bubbling]\nZecora: In what way can you tell that they are indeed under a spell?\nTwilight Sparkle: They're having fun with Discord, that's why!\nZecora: Ah. A friendship with Discord is truly a shock. But who says it is something that we must block?\nTwilight Sparkle: Trust me, they would never laugh like that unless something magical was involved. It's not that funny. I know funny.\nZecora: Alright. This potion will break the spell, then you will be able to tell.\nSpike: Wait. If that's the potion, then what's brewing in your cauldron?\nZecora: It ties the room together and emits a warm glow. But if I am to be honest, it's just for show.\n\nApplejack: [yawns] I wonder why she asked us here so bright and early.\nRarity: Another map adventure, perhaps?\nPinkie Pie: Nope, no glowing tushies here!\nFluttershy: Or maybe it's more of a non-adventure. Maybe she just wants to tell us how last night's slumber went?\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey, gang!\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, you look excited!\nTwilight Sparkle: I am excited! We're gonna have fun today!\nPinkie Pie: Yes!\nTwilight Sparkle: Just one tiny, minuscule, microscopic thing before fun times. I need everypony to sip this potion to break Discord's spell on you!\nApplejack: A what now?\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't be embarrassed. So what if Discord cast a spell on you so you thought you had a great time, and now you have all these inside jokes that you seem to be constantly laughing at? Don't worry! You didn't have your defenses up. I get it.\n[liquid pouring]\nRainbow Dash: You're kidding.\nRarity: Twilight, darling, we simply had a nice time with Discord. As I recall, we spent much of yesterday afternoon reenacting it for you.\n[liquid pouring]\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh-huh. Or you reenacted what you thought was fun but really wasn't because you were under a spell that made you think what happened was fun!\nApplejack: What kind of fertilizer have you had your nose in, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Be honest. The only reason you won't drink the potion is because, deep down in your hearts, you know there's a chance that Discord has you under his power!\nFluttershy: Twilight, how could you say such a thing?! I know Discord still makes mistakes sometimes, but you're accusing him of being downright evil!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! And to top it off, you're accusing us of not being able to tell he was up to something! What do you take us for?\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! [glug] What do you [glug] take us for?!\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: Dee-licious! Got any more, Twilight?\n[door opens]\nDiscord: Hi, Twilight! The gang mentioned we'd all be hanging out together today!\n[liquid pouring]\nTwilight Sparkle: \"The gang\"?\nDiscord: Yeah! The peanut-butter-hoof gang! [tapping]\nMain cast sans Twilight Sparkle: [laughing]\nPinkie Pie: [laughing] It's still funny!\nApplejack: [hushed] So much for that whole \"spell\" theory.\nDiscord and main cast sans Twilight Sparkle: [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh. But it's still not funny!\nRainbow Dash: It's funny if you were there.\nTwilight Sparkle: But I wasn't there! I wasn't included! Maybe it's my own fault for staying in and having a book-sort-cation when I could have been making jokes and memories and having a great time with my friends! But I didn't do that, did I?! You all did! You were all there, but\u2014! [sighs] I wasn't there. I missed out. And seeing you having all these jokes I wasn't a part of and couldn't understand made me...\nSpike: Jealous?\nTwilight Sparkle: No. The Princess of Friendship can't get jealous.\nApplejack: Sure you can, Twilight, and none of us begrudge you for it.\nFluttershy: We're sorry if we made you feel left out.\nTwilight Sparkle: You didn't do anything wrong. You're allowed to share things that don't include me.\nRarity: And you're allowed to feel a little jealous about it. You just have to be able to admit that that's what you're feeling so you can let it go.\nRainbow Dash: And, you know, not try to make us recreate everything that happened when you weren't around.\n[magic zap]\nDiscord: Of course none of this would've happened if I hadn't encouraged everypony not to invite you this weekend.\nTwilight Sparkle: They wanted me to be there? And you convinced them to not invite me?\nDiscord: Well, I didn't think that they should interrupt you. But now I see that we should have. Oh, I feel just terrible.\nPinkie Pie: You don't look like you feel terrible.\nDiscord: Better?\nApplejack: Wait a minute. You didn't suggest not inviting Twilight because you wanted to make her feel left out, did you?\nDiscord: Of course not. That whole jealousy thing was just a happy accident.\n[magic zap]\nDiscord: Certainly we can all agree that Princess Twilight learned a valuable lesson here \u2013 that even she can have feelings of jealousy, that she should recognize said feelings rather than trying to pretend that she doesn't have them. Mm-hmm. Did I get the tiniest bit of glee out of watching her try to recreate our weekend of fun in the name of science? Oh, most definitely! But what's important here is that it was never my intent to make Twilight feel jealous. That's something that the old me would have tried to do. Orange you glad I've changed?\n[long beat]\nDiscord: I said, Orange you glad I've changed?\n[myriad thumps]\nPinkie Pie: [coughs]\nDiscord: Orange! Like the ones at the Applejack farm! I-I mean, from this weekend!\n[beat]\nDiscord: No? Nothing? Really? I thought you'd find this hisss-terical!\n[rattlesnake tail rattling]\nRarity: ...Yes, no. Discord, I think these jokes have run their course.\nPinkie Pie: Only way we'd find them funny now is if you put us all under some kind of spell!\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on, you'd have to be a complete crazy pony to think he'd do something like that! What are you gonna say next, Pinkie? That we all have to drink some weird potion to break the spell?\nMain cast sans Twilight Sparkle: [laughing]\nDiscord: W-W-What's so funny?\nRainbow Dash: Come on, Discord, do we really have to spell it out for you?\nMain cast: [laughing, continues under]\nDiscord: I-I-I don't get it. Somepony want to tell me what's so hilarious? Anypony? Hello?!\n[magic zap]\nDiscord: I'm talking to you! You! And-and you and you! W-W-What's funny about spells? I mean, really, I don't get it, I feel left out and I feel really bad about that...\nSpike: Sorry, buddy. Guess you had to be there.\n[magic zap]\n[magic zap]\nMain cast and Discord: [laughing]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nFluttershy: Does everyanimal have their copy of Wuthering Hooves?

Speaking of which, where are we going?\nTwilight Sparkle: The Smokey Mountains!\nFluttershy: Oh, I've never been there before.\nTwilight Sparkle: Neither have I. And there isn't a lot of information on them. All I could find was this. The Smokey Mountains harbor the most beautiful valley in all of Equestria between its two majestic mountain peaks.\nFluttershy: That's gorgeous. And where there's nature, there's a ton of animal friends!\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't wait to get started! I'm a little nervous since that's all I could find. I usually like to be a bit more prepared.\nFluttershy: You seem pretty prepared to me. Are those for us?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yep! I've prepared our things. Snacks, books, blankets, books.\nFluttershy: You said \"books\" twice.\nTwilight Sparkle: There are a lot of books.\nFluttershy: Ooh!\nTwilight Sparkle: What do ya think our friendship problem's gonna be?\nFluttershy: [struggling] I don't know. [grunts] But I'm sure we'll figure it out. [grunting, panting]\nTwilight Sparkle: Do you think it'll be a problem about lying?\nFluttershy: [grunts] I'm sure we'll find out when we get there.\nTwilight Sparkle: You're right.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Ooh! Could it be about when two friends just randomly decide to do something together, but they forget to invite the third friend, and the third friend feels left out?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Or where one friend tells another friend's secret after they asked them not to?\nFluttershy: [exhausted] We'll know very, very soon.

And I am here to solve your friendship problem.\nFluttershy: I'm Fluttershy, and... um... I'm here, too.\nMa Hooffield: Ma Hooffield. Pleased to meet ya, but you're wastin' your time. We don't have a friendship problem. We have... a McColt problem.\n\"Buzzard Hooffield\": And there's absolutely no friendship there.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, maybe there could be if we figure out what the McColts did to make you so mad.\nMa Hooffield: Oh, they done so many things. Why, just today, they shot pebbles at our farmhouse an' wrecked it. See, we're not very good at buildin', so all it took was a little pebble. But still!\nMice: [squeaking]\nFluttershy: Oh, no!\nTwilight Sparkle: I know what to do. We're gonna talk with these McColts and hear their side of the story. Once we have all the facts, we can put an end to this using reason and rationale.\nFluttershy: Good plan. [to mice] That's why she's the princess.\nTwilight Sparkle: In the meantime, could you please call off the pumpkining?\nMa Hooffield: Oh, alright.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks. C'mon, Fluttershy.\n\n[knock on door]\n\"Steel Bolts\": State your business!\n\"Rosy Riveter\": Don't even bother. They're probably spies for the Hooffields.\n\"Steel Bolts\": Hey, wait! You're an Alicorn! I thought just the three princesses were Alicorns.\nTwilight Sparkle: There are four Alicorn princesses in Equestria now. I am Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship.\nFluttershy: And I'm Fluttershy.\n\"Steel Bolts\": We have a new princess? When did that happen? A-A-And how did the Hooffields come by a princess spy?\nTwilight Sparkle: We are not spies! [to Fluttershy] Why does everypony assume we're spies?\n[gate unlocking]\nBig Daddy McColt: Because we don't get a lot of visitors. I'm Big Daddy McColt. You caught us at a weird time. We're in the middle of a giant feud with our... Terrible neighbors!\n[echoes]\n[birds squawking]\n[farmhouse collapses]\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, actually, that's why we're here \u2013 to solve your problem with the Hooffields.\nBig Daddy McColt: So you're here to help us get rid of 'em.\nMcColts: [whooping, hollering]\nTwilight Sparkle: No! That's not what I meant at all!\nBig Daddy McColt: Well, if you ain't fer us, you're agin' us.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: We are not on anypony's side. We're here to help you become friends again.\nBig Daddy McColt: Well, that's gon' be hard. I don't believe we've ever been friends with the Hooffields!\nTwilight Sparkle: But you could be! They're just really upset you ruined their farmhouse.\nBig Daddy McColt: Wait a hog-wogglin' minute! We only did that because the Hooffields pulled the pin out of our wagon wheel!\n[wagon collapses]\nBig Daddy McColt: A whole week's worth of food rollin' down the mountain. Us McColts are mighty fine builders, but we don't know the first thing about farmin'.\nMcColts: [whickering]\nBig Daddy McColt: We have to travel a ways away to buy our food. Now, we'll be stuck eatin' the pumpkins the Hooffields launched at us. Pumpkin bread, pumpkin soup, pumpkin [mispronounced] quesadillas, pumpkin paella, pumpkin cheese, pumpkin pie, pumpkin frittatas... Actually, that all sounds pretty good. But it'll get old!\n[squirrel squeaking]\nTwilight Sparkle: Have you tried meeting at a neutral location, talking about your problems, and really listening to each other?\nBig Daddy McColt: What?! No! They'd sooner launch their dinners at us than listen to us.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, they'll listen to me. I'm an impartial third party. [voice amplified] Attention, Hooffields and McColts! I'm not on anypony's side, but I can see you're both wasting time and resources on being mean to each other. Ponies are supposed to help each other and be kind. So let's stop this senseless fighting! [speaking normally] There. That should do it. Ready to go home, Fluttershy?\nFluttershy: I'd love to. But if we solved the problem already, shouldn't our cutie marks be glowing again?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, yeah. They should be glowing any minute now...\n[beat]\n[kersplut]\n[kaboom]\n[whistling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Or not.\n[tomatoes splatting]\nTwilight Sparkle: So much for potential friendship solution number twenty-eight.\nFluttershy: I guess we should find out why the Hooffields are launching tomatoes now.\n\nMa Hooffield: One at a time, Greenhoof. If you smoosh them tomaters in the slingshot, they won't break on the McColts.\nTwilight Sparkle: What are you doing? I asked you to stop fighting.\nMa Hooffield: Oh, is that what you were hollerin' about? We thought the McColts rubbed ya the wrong way. So we tomatered them for ya. My mistake. [to Hooffields] Stop the tomater slingshots!\n[hay bales falling]\nMa Hooffield: Reload the tomater slingshots! We're gonna paint their mountaintop red!\nFluttershy: Bleh!\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, that didn't work. I was so sure it would.\n[hay bales falling]\nFluttershy: [gasps] It was a good plan. We need to think of another one. And soon. This fight is really affecting the animals around here.\nTwilight Sparkle: Not to worry. I'll just, uh...\n[pages flipping]\nTwilight Sparkle: ...find the root of the problem and work from there.\n[kaboom]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pardon us, Ma, but do you remember what started this whole feud in the first place?\nMa Hooffield: They know what they did.\n\nBig Daddy McColt: They know what they did!\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm starting to think neither of you know what either of you have done.\nBig Daddy McColt: Sure, we do. Them Hooffields did us a grave injustice some time ago for some reason.\nMcColts: Hear, hear!\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, backup plan to the backup plan. Maybe we can find some common ground that you can bond over. What do you do when you're not fighting?\nBig Daddy McColt: That's easy. Gettin' ready to fight.\n\nFluttershy: What do you hope to get out of fighting?\nMa Hooffield: The satisfaction of winnin'!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Of winning what?\n[hammering]\nBig Daddy McColt: The fight, of course! To prove our family is the best!\n\nFluttershy: The best at what?\nMa Hooffield: Winnin'! Haven't you been listenin'?!\nTwilight Sparkle: So the only thing they have in common is that they both want to win a fight, and neither of them know what it's over. How can I end this feud if I don't know what it's about?\nFluttershy: Ooh! Maybe somepony just needs to say they're sorry.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's a good idea. And friendship solution number forty-eight. But we can move it up.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm so glad you agreed to do this. This apology cake will go a long way to making amends between you two. Which part of my argument changed your mind? The part where I said the benefits of friendship outweigh the cost of war, or the part where I said forgiveness is an investment in happiness?\nMa Hooffield: Yeah, yeah. All of it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait. Are you even listening to me?\n\"Steel Bolts\": Who goes there?!\nMa Hooffield: It's Ma Hooffield.\n\"Steel Bolts\": Hooffield alert! Arm the cannons!\nMa Hooffield: With an apology cake!\n\"Steel Bolts\": Did you say \"cake\"? As in... [slurps] cake?\nMa Hooffield: Consider it a gesture of goodwill from us to you.\nMcColt Guards: [slurping]\n\"Rosy Riveter\": I haven't had cake in ages.\n\"Steel Bolts\": Open the gates!\n[gates open]\n\"Hacksaw McColt\": [sniffles] Oh, it's such a bee-utiful cake.\nTwilight Sparkle: Think of this as more than just a cake. It's the first step in the long road to forgiveness.\nFluttershy: Nothing says \"let's be friends\" like a cake that says, \"Let's be friends!\" [hushed] I wrote that in icing on the top.\n[cracking]\nHooffields: For glory! Whoa!\nBig Daddy McColt: McColts! Assume Delta Force formation!\nMcColts: Yah!\n[both families shouting]\nMa Hooffield: Ready... aim... fire!\n[sproing]\n[food falling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ma Hooffield, you planted ponies in that cake?!\nMa Hooffield: Yeah! [laughing] Wait. Were you serious about apologizin'? Why in Equestria would we do that? We didn't do anythin' wrong!\nBig Daddy McColt: What're you talkin' about?! You done so many things wrong!\nMa Hooffield: Not as many as you!\nMa Hooffield and Big Daddy McColt: [growling]\n[both families fighting]\n\n[sounds of fighting]\nFluttershy: Um, if you could just not yell so much or maybe stop saying words altogether...\n[sounds of fighting]\n[thud]\nFluttershy: Wah! Twilight?\n[pages ripping, magic zaps]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\nFluttershy: Um, Twilight? We should probably get back there. I mean, if you need a break, that's fine, but I really can't do this without you.\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know if we can do this at all. Even if I make things right, they're just gonna fight again.\n[critters chittering]\nFluttershy: Hey, little fellas. Oh, that's okay, you can come out.\n[various critters chittering]\n[groan]\nTwilight Sparkle: What was that?\n[critter stomachs rumbling]\nFluttershy: Oh, you poor things! There isn't enough food here for you! Oh, brrr, and you're freezing! I'm gonna take you all home with me and get you all hot cocoas. How do you feel about book clubs?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't get it. This was supposed to be the most beautiful valley in all of Equestria. What happened?\n[squirrel chittering]\nFluttershy: What's that? Oh! Uh-huh... Twilight! They know what happened here!\nTwilight Sparkle: What?\n\n[sounds of fighting]\nTwilight Sparkle: Stop! You have to listen to me!\n[splat]\nTwilight Sparkle: Everypony freeze! [echoing out]\n[magic zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: [straining] Fluttershy! You have to tell them! [strains] It's a lot harder to freeze an army of ponies than just six of them!\nFluttershy: [raised voice] Before you keep fighting, there is something you should know! Long ago, there were two best friends...\n\nFluttershy: [voiceover] ...Grub Hooffield and Piles McColt. When they found the valley between the Smokey Mountains, they knew it was something special. So they made a promise to each other to protect and preserve the valley for all its adorable furry inhabitants. But they disagreed on how to go about it. Grub wanted to start by planting crops so that everypony would have something to eat. But Piles thought it would be better to start by building a shelter to protect them against the cold and wind. The two ponies were unable to come to an understanding, so Piles went ahead and built a shelter anyway, exactly where Grub was gonna start his farm! Grub was upset, so he tore down Piles' shelter so he could plant his crops!\n[crash]\nFluttershy: [voiceover] They kept fighting back and forth, until it turned into a feud!\n[crunch]\n[thud]\n[water pouring]\n[thud]\n[crunch]\n[splash]\nFluttershy: [voiceover] The valley suffered from the constant destruction, until finally the Hooffields and McColts moved to separate mountains.\n\nFluttershy: Even then, the valley and all the animals in it continued to be caught in the crossfire. You see? By fighting, you're destroying the very thing that brought you here in the first place! So it's time you both put your differences aside and come together! If not for yourselves, then for the sake of these cute and cuddly guys!\nTwilight Sparkle: [straining]\nBig Daddy McColt: Aw, shucks, we never meant to hurt you little critters.\nMa Hooffield: Yeah, we're sorry!\n[squirrel chittering]\nFluttershy: They say they accept your apology.\n[beat]\nBig Daddy McColt: Uh, princess? You can unfreeze us now.\nTwilight Sparkle: [straining] Oh, right!\n[thud]\nBig Daddy McColt: Ma Hooffield? We promise we won't fight you no more.\nMa Hooffield: Us too, except we promise not to fight you. I suppose it doesn't matter who's right. We're both wrong.\nBig Daddy McColt: That's one thing we can agree on.\nBig Daddy McColt and Ma Hooffield: [spits]\n[critters chittering]\n[teleportation zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: This is wonderful! I am so proud of you two!\nMa Hooffield: Aw, thanks, princess. Though I would just like to point out that I was the, uh, first to admit I was wrong.\nBig Daddy McColt: That may be, but I promised not to fight first. That counts for more!\nMa Hooffield: Oh, yeah?!\n[critters chittering]\nMa Hooffield: Oh, all right. We don't have to speak animal to know what y'all are sayin'. Truce?\nBig Daddy McColt: Truce.\n\n[sounds of work and critters chittering]\nBig Daddy McColt: Woo-hoo! Ain't that a pretty sight?\nMa Hooffield: Sure is! The McColts are gonna help us rebuild our homes! Good ones this time.\nBig Daddy McColt: And the Hooffields are gonna help us grow some crops!\n\"Steel Bolts\": Not pumpkins.\nMa Hooffield: Thanks for teachin' us that friendship is so much better than winnin' a silly argument.\n[cutie marks ringing]\nFluttershy: Yay! I told you we'd figure it out.\nTwilight Sparkle: We did, and we didn't need my friendship portfolio to do it. We just needed each other. So, what do you think will happen next? We've all been called by the map now.\nFluttershy: Oof! [straining] I'm sure we'll find out when we get home...\nTwilight Sparkle: What if it summons all six of us to another place? Or another pony we weren't expecting? [gasps] What if it wants us to solve other kinds of problems, like quantum physics, or why the apple doesn't fall far from the tree?\n\n[country music plays over credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[creaking and squeaking]\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow, Applejack! Are you sure you've never managed a concert before?\nApplejack: Well, it turns out doin' up a concert's the same as settin' up a rodeo.\nTwilight Sparkle: And thanks to Pinkie's connections organizing the Ponypalooza Rock Concert, we've got quite a lineup for the Helping Hooves Music Festival.\nPinkie Pie: Twilight! Applejack! Rainbow Dash! Rarity! Fluttershy! Spike! Pinkie Pie! Oh wait, that's me. Everypony!\nTwilight Sparkle: What is it, Pinkie?\nPinkie Pie: I have the most amazing news ever! It is totally gonna freak your frizz!\nRainbow Dash: Well, spill it, Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie: It wasn't easy. In fact, it was terribly difficult. But I have managed to book the biggest pony pop star in all of Equestria as the main attraction of the Helping Hooves Music Festival!\nApplejack: Sapphire Shores?\nPinkie Pie: Sapphire Shores?! Please! Sapphire Shores is merely the second biggest pony pop star in Equestria. I have booked the one, the only, Countess Coloratura!\nFluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Rarity and Twilight Sparkle: Ahhh...\nApplejack: Who in the hay is Countess Coloratura?\nSweetie Drops and Lyra Heartstrings: [gasps]\nAmethyst Star: [gasps]\nFluttershy, Noteworthy, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Royal Riff, Spike, Sprinkle Medley and Twilight Sparkle: [gasps]\n[poing]\nPinkie Pie: My frizz has been freaked!\n\n[theme song]\n\nApplejack: Pinkie Pie, who is this Countess Coloratura pony?\nPinkie Pie: Uh, I just told you that she's the biggest pony pop star in Equestria! How-how-how-how-how have you not heard of her?!\nApplejack: Don't know. Though I did know a gal named Coloratura when I was just a filly. [laughs and snorts] Wouldn't it just be the funniest thing if that Coloratura and this Coloratura were the same Coloratura? Heh.\nPinkie Pie: Do you mean to tell me that you actually know Countess Coloratura?\nApplejack: Well, I don't think it's the same pony, since my friend wasn't any sort of high-falutin' countess.\nPinkie Pie: Do you remember her cutie mark?\nApplejack: Sure do. It had this super colorful bunch of musical notes that just shimmered in the light.\nPinkie Pie: You mean... like this?!\nApplejack: Well, fancy that! That there's the very same cutie mark!\nPinkie Pie: Do you have any idea the number of hoops I had to jump through to get her to perform at the festival?! A whole lot of hoops! That pony is very demanding!\nApplejack: Nah.\nPinkie Pie: Yah!\nRarity: I completely understand. We artistes require certain necessities in order to do our best work.\nApplejack: This was clearly some sort of misunderstandin', 'cause Rara was just as down home as me!\nFluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Royal Riff, Spike, Sprinkle Medley and Twilight Sparkle: Rara?!\nApplejack: Even that big name was too fancy for her, so I shortened Coloratura to \"Rara\"!\n\n[foals shouting]\nApplejack: [voiceover] We had the best time at Camp Friendship!\n[splat]\nApplejack: [voiceover] Rara was just so easygoin'! We were like two apples from the same branch.\n[splashing]\nApplejack: [voiceover] Rara and I prepared this song for the camp talent show. When we performed, she belted it out, singin' in the most colorful, clear voice I'd ever heard!\n\n\n[Young Coloratura]\nEquestria, the land I love\nA land of harmony\nOur flag does wave from high above\nFor ponykind to see\n\nEquestria, the land I love\nA land of harmony\nOur flag does wave from high above\nFor ponykind to see\n\nEquestria, a land of friends\nWhere ponykind do roam\nThey say true friendship never ends\nEquestria, my home\n[ting]\n[ponies cheering]\nApplejack: [voiceover] After camp, we wrote to each other for a bit, but...\n\nEquestria, a land of friends\nWhere ponykind do roam\nThey say true friendship never ends\nEquestria, my home\n\nApplejack: ...then we lost touch. But Rara always did want to go to Manehattan to try and make it big. But a demandin' diva? Just you wait, Pinkie. Once Rara gets here, you'll see she's just a plain old pony like you and me.\nPinkie Pie: I don't have to wait \u2013 she's here!\nApplejack: Really?\n[pop music BGM]\n[rumbling and clanking]\nApplejack: Rara?\n\nPinkie Pie: [squealing] Countess Coloratura!\nSvengallop: Clear the way! Stand back! Keep your hooves and tail to yourselves!\n[cameras clicking]\nApplejack: No... that can't be her. [clears throat] Um... hi. Remember me? We met at Camp Friendship? I gave you the nickname \"Rara\"?\nColoratura: AJ?\nApplejack: Yeah! Heh. Howdy, Rara!\nSvengallop: [unintelligible whispering]\n[splat]\nColoratura: Hoofsies! [short laugh]\nRarity: Ooh, you got hoofsies from Countess Coloratura! Look! Ooh, she clearly thinks you're very special!\nColoratura: Hoofsies! Hoofsies! Hoofsies! [short laugh]\nApplejack: Yeah... real special.\nSvengallop: Now that's how you make an entrance! Big, bold, absolutely stunning! Though it was muddied a bit with your interaction with that dusty farmpony. Do you actually know her?\nColoratura: Oh, yeah, that's my childhood fillyfriend AJ! She was the one that started calling me Rara.\nSvengallop: Oh, yes, how cute and... common. Of course, I was the one that started calling you Countess, and just look at how you've moved up in Equestria since then! Why, you've gotten everything you've ever wanted! Speaking of which, where is the pony Pinkie Pie?\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! I'm the pony Pinkie Pie, Mr. Manager, sir!\nSvengallop: Do you have the water imported from Rainbow Falls that I requested for Countess Coloratura?\nPinkie Pie: I have twenty glass containers full right here!\n[clink]\nSvengallop: Did I not tell you to provide straws in all of Countess Coloratura's beverages?\nPinkie Pie: Uh, I don't think so. But lucky for you, I have the biggest straw collection in Equestria! I call this straw Fernando.\n[flamenco music]\nSvengallop: Hm. Let us confirm that you acquired the rest of the items that Countess Coloratura requested before she performs her run-through, shall we?\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, we shall!\nSvengallop: Floral arrangements from the royal Canterlot gardens... Chocolate \u00e9clairs made by Gustave le Grand... A selection of crystals from the Crystal Empire... Freshly picked cherries from Cherry Jubilee's farm separated red from yellow...\nPinkie Pie: Abso-toot-ly!\nSvengallop: Well, by some miracle, your requests have been reasonably met. So let us move on... to rehearsal!\nPinkie Pie: See, Applejack? Demanding!\nApplejack: Pinkie's right, Rarity! The Rara I knew didn't hide behind a veil givin' out fake stamp kisses, sippin' up imported water, and needin' her cherries separated.\nRarity: Oh, I do understand. Sometimes it's hard to see our friends change.\nApplejack: She's become a whole other pony!\nRarity: Trust me.

I don't believe it!\nSvengallop: Oh, my shining star! Thanks to the sparkling costumes, dazzling choreography, and brilliant vocal effects that I designed, your performance was spectacular, Countess Coloratura!\nColoratura: Oh, [short laugh], thank you, Svengallop!\nApplejack: Correct me if I'm wrong here, but that feller isn't actually complimentin' Rara. He's complimentin' all the bells and whistles he's piled on to make her Countess Coloratura.\nRarity: Oh, no-no-no-no-no, you don't understand, Applejack. Creating all those elements is a lot of work, and Countess Coloratura's performance wouldn't exist without them.\nApplejack: If you ask me, that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing.\n\nHear the applause\nHere to impress\nNot just a pony, I am the Countess!\n\nColoratura: Oh, if we're all done here, I'd love to go back to my trailer and rest, Svengallop.\nPinkie Pie: Actually, right now you're scheduled for your meet and greet with the schoolponies!\nSvengallop: Ugh. I can totally get you out of meeting with the schoolponies, Countess.\nColoratura: Absolutely not. My favorite part of any event is meeting with the schoolponies!\nApplejack: The schoolponies'll be so happy to hear that, Rara!\n\nColoratura: Ponyville schoolponies! As part of the Helping Hooves Music Festival, I'm holding a contest where some of you will get a chance to sing with me onstage at the concert tomorrow! Sound fun?\n[foals cheering]\nColoratura: Alright! Now who wants more hoofsies?\n[foals cheering]\nApplejack: Now that's more like the Rara I remember.\nPinkie Pie: [distant] But... I got everything you requested!\nSvengallop: That was for Countess Coloratura! This is for me! And what I want is premium oats!\nPinkie Pie: Oh! Well, we have lots of tasty oats right here in Ponyville!\nSvengallop: I would not feed those to a chicken! I want top-of-the-line Appleloosan oats! Next, it appears that we are surrounded by apple trees. Bring me five hundred pre-peeled, pre-cored apples, and I want those things in twenty-four hours!\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] But that's impossible!\nSvengallop: Do you want me to pull Countess Coloratura from your little podunk charity show?! Because I will!\nPinkie Pie: Applejack! Svengallop just made all of these new demands and he said\u2014\nApplejack: I heard, Pinkie. But don't you fret. I'll talk to Rara and fix things right up.\nApple Bloom: Did'ja see, sis?! Did'ja see?!\nColoratura: Is this the little sister you wrote to me about, AJ?\nApple Bloom: Hold on, Applejack. You wrote to Countess Coloratura about me?!\nColoratura: AJ said you were the best little sister ever, Apple Bloom!\n[beat]\nApplejack: Alright now, you'd best get along, little ponies.\nColoratura: [laughs]\nApplejack: Uh... Hey, Rara, you mind if I talk to you about your manager?\nColoratura: Sure, what about him?\nApplejack: Well, while you were meetin' with the schoolponies, he was demandin' all sorts of stuff from Pinkie Pie.\nColoratura: Svengallop works very hard as my manager, AJ, so if he needs some things when we're on the road, I don't see anything wrong with that.\nApplejack: Well, do you see somethin' wrong with him tellin' Pinkie that if she doesn't get those things by tomorrow, he'd pull you from our charity festival?\nColoratura: What? But he knows how important charity is to me, and leaving the festival would completely ruin my image!\nApplejack: I'm afraid Svengallop doesn't give a pickled pippin about your charity work.\nColoratura: That's not true! Svengallop has always supported me in all my interests. You're just saying those things because you're jealous!\nApplejack: Jealous of what? A pony who hides behind a veil so thick she can't see when somepony's usin' her? No, I'm not jealous of that, Rara!\nColoratura: I am not Rara! I am Countess Coloratura! And while we may have been friends when we were young, we have clearly gone in different directions!\n\n[squeaking]\nApplejack: It just ain't right! He's manipulatin' her, and she's just not seein' it!\nPinkie Pie: Enough stewin', more peelin'!\nApplejack: Sorry, Pinkie, but there is no way I'm lettin' that lousy Svengallop use my friend like that!\nPinkie Pie: [groans]\n\nApplejack: Countess Coloratura!\nColoratura: Wow, AJ, you said my real name.\nApplejack: I said your new name, but I saw the real you hangin' out with those schoolponies yesterday. And I know somepony that'd prefer if you stop doin' those little events.\nColoratura: Ugh, not this again.\nApplejack: Come on now. You've just got to give me a chance to prove what I'm sayin' is true.\nColoratura: And just how are you going to do that?\nApplejack: Do exactly what I say. We'll see if that Svengallop truly has your best interests at heart.\n\nColoratura: Svengallop? Svengallop! Where are you, Svengallop?\nSvengallop: Here I am! Did you need something?\nColoratura: Yes, I was... considering... m-maybe cancelling the contest with the schoolponies...?\nSvengallop: Countess, this is wonderful! I've been waiting forever for you to cancel that pointless schoolpony contest.\nColoratura: You... have?\nSvengallop: You do it at every charity event, and it does absolutely nothing to promote the Countess Coloratura image that I built! Consider it cancelled. Pinkie Pie!\nPinkie Pie: [out of breath] Yes, Svengallop, sir! [coughs]\nSvengallop: We are making some adjustments to the show. Follow me!\n[magic twinkling]\n[thud]\nSvengallop: Cancel the contest for the fillies and schedule me a spa treatment. Now that I don't have to oversee a rehearsal with those brats, I have time for the works! You know the drill! Deliver, or the diva ditches your dippy charity!\n\nSvengallop: Okay, Countess Coloratura, all taken care of!\n[audio feedback]\nSvengallop: [amplified] You know the drill! Deliver, or the diva ditches your dippy charity!\nColoratura: So that's how you've been managing things?\nSvengallop: Yeah, so? What's the problem?\nColoratura: The problem is, is you've been using my name to intimidate ponies to get what you want!\nSvengallop: But I work incredibly hard for you! I deserve everything I get!\nColoratura: But not because you scare ponies into thinking I won't perform for their charities otherwise! I would never do that to my fans! Which is why you should have known that I would never cancel the schoolponies' contest!\nSvengallop: Hmph. All this charity and schoolpony contest nonsense is just remnants of that boring little Rara I met back in Manehattan!\nColoratura: You clearly don't understand the real me!\nSvengallop: Ha, that's a joke! I made you somepony! What can you even do without me? Good luck, Countess Coloratura! Good luck.\nApplejack: Oh, Rara, I'm so sorry. Are you gonna be okay for the concert tonight?\nColoratura: Of course. After all, the show must go on!\n\nColoratura: Oh, my gosh, Rarity, Svengallop's right! This is gonna be a disaster! I'm gonna be terrible!\nApplejack: Can you give us a minute, Rarity?\nRarity: Certainly.\nApplejack: Now, why's it gonna be so terrible?\nColoratura: Because Svengallop was in charge of everything! The lights, the visuals, the sound! Without Svengallop, I have nothing!\nApplejack: Now, now, don't go gettin' yourself into a tizzy there, Rara. Svengallop turned you into Countess Coloratura and acted like your friend so he could enjoy the perks that came with bein' a star. But the real perk of friendship is gettin' to see your friend bein' true to their self. And Rara, when you're simply yourself, you're the brightest star I've ever seen shine.\n\n[crowd cheering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Good evening, everypony!

When I arrived at the Helping Hooves Music Festival, I had forgotten who I really was! But then an old friend reminded me what real friendship is about, and she told me that if I was true to myself, I couldn't go wrong! So I have a very special surprise for her.

That was even better than the first eleven times. [clears throat]\nTwilight Sparkle: Eh, I don't know, Spike. I'd like to be able to get through the whole speech without looking at the cards.\nSpike: Come on, Twilight! You can't be nervous about giving a speech to a bunch of magic students!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, I'm not nervous, Spike, but I do have to set a good example, especially for magic students. That's why this speech has to be...\nSpike: [sighs] Perfect?\nTwilight Sparkle: Exactly. Let's go through it one more time. [clears throat] When Princess Celestia asked me to speak to you today, I was honored to have the opportunity to talk about my favorite subject: magic.\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Obviously, the long term effects of...\nAudience Pony: Shhhh.\nTwilight Sparkle: ...the simultaneous acquisition of cutie marks has yet to be determined, but... [sips water] Ahem. Next slide, please.\nSpike: [snoring] Huh? Huh!\nTwilight Sparkle: I can speak from my own experience that the power of Cutie Mark Magic is very real, and in the instance of my friends and I, it can be traced to a single event! Without Rainbow Dash's race to defend Fluttershy's honor, this rainboom wouldn't have happened. Fluttershy might never have discovered her love of animals. Applejack might never have realized that she belonged on her farm. And Pinkie Pie might never have decided to leave hers. It might be hard to imagine Rarity without her sense of fabulousness. But it's even harder to fathom what my life would be like. Without this rainboom, I might not have gotten into magic school. Celestia wouldn't have taken me on as her pupil or sent me to Ponyville to meet my friends. And the most powerful thing about Cutie Mark Magic that I found is the connection I share with them.\n[beat]\nTwilight Sparkle: But, um...\n[cards shuffling]\nTwilight Sparkle: The real question about... Cutie Mark Magic is... who it seems to affect.\n\nSpike: Starlight Glimmer?\nTwilight Sparkle: I was sure I saw her, Spike. But when I looked again, she was gone! I'm just worried what she could be up to.\nSpike: Nothing good, I bet. I heard she wasn't very happy the last time you saw her.\nTwilight Sparkle: Forcing everypony in her village to have the same cutie mark wasn't right. We had to do something!\nSpike: And now she's coming back for revenge. Uh, or she was just really interested in your speech!\nTwilight Sparkle: Honestly, Spike. I'm not really sure what I saw. But as long as I have my friends, I know everything will be all right.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe I was just more stressed about that speech than I thought.\nSpike: Yeah. That sounds better than Starlight Glimmer coming back with an evil plot for revenge.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, when you say it like that, it does sound kinda silly.\nSpike: Or it's totally true!\nStarlight Glimmer: Welcome home, Twilight!\n[magic zaps]\nTwilight Sparkle: What are you doing, Starlight?\nStarlight Glimmer: [laughs] I'd tell you, but I don't want to ruin the surprise! Won't be needing that anymore. [laughs]\n[magic zaps]\n[clocks ticking]\n[magic zaps]\nSpike: Where'd she go?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know, Spike, but I think we better find out!\nSpike: I guess we could start with this.\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, no!

[loud chewing]\n\nTwilight Sparkle and Spike: [screaming]\n[clocks ticking]\nTwilight Sparkle and Spike: [screaming]\nSpike: [continued screaming] Cloudsdale? Starlight doesn't even have wings! Why would she come here?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know, Spike, but it looked like she could fly with just magic! Keep your eyes open. We don't know what she has planned.\n[whoosh]\nSpike: Isn't that Rainbow Dash?\nTwilight Sparkle: Did Rainbow Dash look really young to you? And I didn't see a cutie mark. You don't think...\nSpike: ...We traveled back in time to when Rainbow Dash raced the bullies who made fun of Fluttershy and performed her first sonic rainboom?\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, only Star Swirl the Bearded could do something like that, and even his spell just went back a week! How could Starlight do more than the greatest wizard in Equestria?\n[paper rustling]\nSpike: With this.\nTwilight Sparkle: Star Swirl's spell! Oh, no!\nSpike: Come on, let's go!\nTwilight Sparkle: Go where?\nSpike: To watch the race. I don't wanna miss the rainboom!

I don't know what Starlight's up to yet, but we'd better figure it out before it's too late.\nSpike: Um, Twilight? I think it already is.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\n\nSpike: Uh, Twilight? Where's your castle?\nTwilight Sparkle: The map pulled us back, but whatever Starlight did in the past changed things here!\nSpike: But why? And how did we get here? Where's here?\nTwilight Sparkle: More like when.\nSpike: What do you mean?\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight altered Star Swirl's spell, then somehow used it on the map to travel into the past and change something! Once she did, the map pulled us back to the present!\nSpike: So we're back where\u2014 I mean, when we started?\nTwilight Sparkle: Not exactly. Everything's different. Look. The map doesn't even make sense anymore! The Crystal Empire takes up half of Equestria!\nSpike: Plus there's the whole missing castle thing.\nTwilight Sparkle: Right! This is too big to handle on our own.\nSpike: You think?\nTwilight Sparkle: We need to find our friends and get help!\n\n[crow cawing]\nSpike: I'm gettin' a bad feeling about this, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: I know, Spike, but this is Ponyville. How bad could things be?\nSpike: Is that Sugarcube Corner?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't understand.\nSpike: [gasps] [panting] Rarity?\n[knocking]\nSpike: [grunts] Rarity?!\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't think she's here, Spike. I'm not sure anything we know is the same. But I know one place that could never change!\n\n[sign squeaking]\n[machines grinding]\n[squeaking]\n[machines grinding and hissing]\n[rumbling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack?!\nApplejack: What can I do for you?\nTwilight Sparkle: It's so good to see you! We couldn't find Pinkie or Rarity or Fluttershy or Rainbow Dash, but I just knew you'd still be here!\nApplejack: Of course I am. This is my home. But who in tarnation is Pinkie Bow and Flutterdash? Or you for that matter?\nTwilight Sparkle: You... don't know who I am?\nApplejack: Nope. Honestly, the only name I recognize is Rarity, but she left for Manehattan years ago.\nSpike: Probably to become a world-famous fashion designer, I bet.\nApplejack: Not that I know of. Last I heard, she went to help with the cause like everypony else.\nTwilight Sparkle: The cause?\nApplejack: The war against King Sombra and the Crystal Empire?\nTwilight Sparkle and Spike: What?!\nApplejack: Where have you two been?\nSpike: Actually, it's when.\nTwilight Sparkle: I know this is hard to believe, but you and I and those other ponies I mentioned are friends!\nApplejack: Did you bump your head on a crate of cider or somethin'?\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm telling you the truth! And if you come with me, I'll prove it.\n\nApplejack: Well, I'll admit. I've lived in these parts my whole life and I've never seen this before.\nSpike: There's also supposed to be a castle that goes with it.\nApplejack: But I still don't see what this has to do with you and I bein' friends.\nTwilight Sparkle: Another pony named Starlight Glimmer used this map to travel through time and change things in the past. For some reason, the map's here but everything else is different!\nApplejack: Different how?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, for one thing, where we came from, there's no war with King Sombra. Maybe you could tell us how the war started, then we can figure out when everything changed!\nApplejack: That's easy enough. [sighs] When the Crystal Empire returned, it brought King Sombra back with it.\n\n[flames whooshing]\nApplejack: [voiceover] And it didn't take long for him to force every one of his subjects to fight for him against Equestria.\n\n[marching]\n[plane engine noises]\n[sounds of battle]\nKing Sombra: [laughs]\n[rumbling]\n[rapid digging]\nApplejack: [voiceover] And even with Princess Celestia leadin' the charge, it still takes every last pony in Equestria doin' their part, workin' day and night, to keep up the fight.\n[train whistle]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I just can't believe it! We stopped King Sombra! You and me and all of our friends!\nApplejack: But we aren't friends. At least not here.\nTwilight Sparkle: Right.\nApplejack: Look. I hope all this helped, but I really need to get back to cannin' those apples.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you. We're going to set things right.\nApplejack: [sighs] I hope you do.\nSpike: So... how are we gonna set things right?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know! The only thing we know for sure is that Starlight stopped the rainboom.\nSpike: And that the map's still here.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Spike, that's it! The map is connected to the Tree of Harmony! It must sense that something isn't right! That's why it's still here! I'll just use Starlight's version of the spell and go back a little earlier and stop her before she even knows we're there!\n[paper rustling]\n[magic zaps]\n\n[magic zaps]\nSpike: [screaming]\nTwilight Sparkle: All we have to do now is find Starlight and\u2014\n[magic zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, finding her will be easy! But stopping her's gonna be harder than you think. Sorry to disappoint you, but I created that spell to send myself back in time. So even when you cast it, I still get sent back here. It wasn't difficult to change Star Swirl's spell. He'd already done the hard part. But figuring out I could use the map to go to any time or place and pull you along with me? [short laugh] I even impressed myself with that. I knew you'd try to stop me. You're so predictable. Why else would I leave the scroll behind? Touching it triggered the map to whisk you here and watch me erase the one thing that linked you with your friends! My village was a sanctuary of equality, where nopony's cutie mark allowed them to feel superior! It was a special place, and you and your friends took it away!\n[beat]\nStarlight Glimmer: Now it's my turn to take something special from you! Without the rainboom, you and your friends will never form your special cutie mark bonds! Cutie marks for cutie marks! Sounds like a fair trade to me!\n[tok]\n\n[crystal shattering]\nSpike: Twiliiiiiiight!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oops!\nSpike: [screaming] Thanks!\nTwilight Sparkle: No problem, Spike. At least now we know exactly what we have to do!\n\n[teleportation zaps]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, keep your eyes peeled.\nSpike: Right!\nTwilight Sparkle: We have to stop Starlight as soon as Rainbow Dash and those bullies race by!\nSpike: Um, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: So be ready.\nSpike: I know, but\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: Because she could pop up anywhere!\nSpike: Like over there?\n[aah-OOOOOOO-gah!!!]\nTwilight Sparkle: [short gasp]\nStarlight Glimmer: Just remember how you'd feel if someone said those things to you.\nTwilight Sparkle: What's going on here?\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, I was just reminding these two colts how hurtful teasing can be.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, don't!\nYoung Dumb-Bell and Hoops: Huh?\nYoung Fluttershy: Huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: I mean... you were?\nStarlight Glimmer: Of course! In a world where everypony is unique, some are bound to feel more special than others. But that isn't a license to be cruel, is it?\nTwilight Sparkle: No, of course not...\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, isn't it a shame we don't live in a world where everypony is equal? No one would ever tease anyone there! Wouldn't that be nice?\nYoung Dumb-Bell, Fluttershy and Hoops: Mm-hmm.\nTwilight Sparkle: No, it wouldn't! I mean, it'd be nice not to be teased, of course, but that's not the same thing!\nYoung Hoops: Come on, Fluttershy. Maybe I can help you get through the course this time.\nYoung Fluttershy: Well, I-I sure could use the practice...\nTwilight Sparkle: I know you only convinced those bullies to not tease Fluttershy to stop the rainboom!\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, that's not true. I convinced them not to be bullies because everypony should be equal. Stopping the rainboom is just a bonus.\n[whoosh]\nSpike: Look!\nTwilight Sparkle: This isn't over yet!\nStarlight Glimmer: If you say so!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Hi!\nYoung Rainbow Dash: Um... hi?\nTwilight Sparkle: You think you can stop for a minute?\nYoung Rainbow Dash: Sure.\n[thump]\nTwilight Sparkle: I hear you're pretty fast!\nYoung Rainbow Dash: Pretty fast? Please! I'm even faster than that!\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, so, um, hey, you want to race?\nYoung Rainbow Dash: Um, that wouldn't really be fair. I mean, you're a full-grown pony, and... Wait. Are you an Alicorn?\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on, I thought you were fast!\n[sproing]\nYoung Rainbow Dash: Uh, actually, I just remembered I have somewhere I need to be.\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, listen. You don't have to race me. I just need you to fly fast enough for a sonic rainboom!\nYoung Rainbow Dash: What?! I can't do that! Nopony can! It's not even a real thing! It's just an old mare's tale!\nTwilight Sparkle: But it's not! I know it's not! I've seen you do it! In the future!\nYoung Rainbow Dash: Ooookay... I'm gonna go now.\nTwilight Sparkle: No! Wait!\nStarlight Glimmer: Gee, Twilight, what's the matter? Couldn't convince her to do the impossible? That's too bad.\nTwilight Sparkle: [inhales]\n[magic zap]\n[clocks ticking]\n\n[magic zaps]\n[thud]\nSpike: Ugh. Well, that didn't work.\nTwilight Sparkle: This is gonna be harder than I thought.

But this is the second time I've come back and this world is even worse than the last one! If Starlight keeps doing the same thing in the past, how could the present be so different?\nZecora: Ah. Time is a river, where even the tiniest changes seen can lead to a cascade of effects downstream.\n\nZecora: This part of the forest is dark and damp, but it's done well to hide our camp.\n[thunk]\nSpike: This is cozy.\nRarity: [shrieks] Please!

And what you're doing leads here. I know I can't stop you, but I thought showing you this might change your mind.\nStarlight Glimmer: Change my mind? You don't know anything about me! I was perfectly happy before you and your friends ruined what I built!\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know what happened that led you to make your village without cutie marks, and I'm sorry my friends and I had to take it away.\nStarlight Glimmer: You want to know what happened to me?! I'll show you!\n[magic zaps]\n[clocks ticking]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Where are we?\nStarlight Glimmer: That map of yours is connected to every part of Equestria, and this part is my home.\n[young Starlight Glimmer clapping]\nStarlight Glimmer: Sunburst and I did everything together. In fact, I don't remember us ever being apart. Until today.\n[rumbling]\n[myriad thumps]\nSunburst: [whinnies]\n[ponies excited]\nStarlight Glimmer: And just like that, my friend was gone. His family recognized his magical talent and sent him off to Canterlot. I never saw him again.\nSpike: Well, why not?\nStarlight Glimmer: Because of his cutie mark! He got his, and I didn't! He moved on, and I didn't! I stayed here and never made another friend because I was too afraid another cutie mark would take them away, too!\nTwilight Sparkle: That's ridiculous. A cutie mark can't take your friends away.\nStarlight Glimmer: Not everypony's lucky enough to get her cutie mark at the same time as her friends!\n[magic zaps]\n\n[magic zaps]\nStarlight Glimmer: You don't know what it's like to lose a friend because of a cutie mark. But once I stop the rainboom, you will!\n[magic zaps]\nStarlight Glimmer: And when I destroy this scroll, there'll be no way for you to change it!\n[paper ripping]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight, you're right! I don't know what you went through! But I do know you can't do this! I've seen where this leads, and so have you!\nStarlight Glimmer: I only saw what you showed me! Who knows what'll really happen?\nTwilight Sparkle: I've seen it a dozen times! Things don't turn out well in Equestria without my friends!\nStarlight Glimmer: Ugh! What's so special about your friends?! How can a group of ponies that are so different be so important?!\nTwilight Sparkle: The differences between me and my friends are the very things that make our friendship strong!\nStarlight Glimmer: I thought Sunburst and I were the same. But we turned out different, and it tore our friendship apart!\nTwilight Sparkle: So try again! Make new friends! And if something that you can't control happens that changes things, work through it together! That's what friendship is! And it's not just my friendships that are important to Equestria! Everypony's are! When yours ended, it led us here. But just imagine all the others that are out there waiting for you if you just give them a chance!\nStarlight Glimmer: How do I know they won't all end the same way?\nTwilight Sparkle: I guess it's up to you to make sure they don't.\n[whoosh]\n[paper rustling]\n[boom]\n[magic zaps]\n\n[magic zaps]\n[thumps]\n[magic zaps]\nSpike: [kissing] One Castle of Friendship \u2013 check!\n[door opens]\nRarity: What in Equestria was that?!\nFluttershy: Is everypony okay?\nPinkie Pie: [squeals] Can you do it again?\nSpike: One group of amazing friends \u2013 check!\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah, Spike. It looks like we're home!\nApplejack: Uh... what's she doin' here?\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, it's kind of a long story.\n\n[muffled voices]\nRainbow Dash: I mean, I knew my rainboom was awesome, but I never thought all of Equestria depended on it!\nPinkie Pie: Or on us!\nTwilight Sparkle: I think it's more than that. Friendship connects all of Equestria, and undoing one group of friends made its magic less powerful.\nApplejack: I can't believe y'all were able to travel through time like that.\nPinkie Pie: That Starlight must be pretty magical!\nTwilight Sparkle: She obviously has more talent for magic than almost anypony I've seen. My magic couldn't stop her. I had to convince her to stop on her own. Once I realized that, everything fell into place.\nApplejack: But if she's as powerful as all that, we can't just send her on her way, can we?\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, I kind of have something else in mind.\n\n[door opens]\nStarlight Glimmer: [gulps, exhales] I know there's no excuse for what I did, but I want you all to know that I'm ready for whatever punishment you think is fair.\nTwilight Sparkle: I've been thinking a lot about how badly Equestria fared without just one group of friends. Because even when one friendship dies, the results can be disastrous.\nStarlight Glimmer: I know first-hoof how true that can be.\nTwilight Sparkle: And that's why I've asked you here. If you're willing to learn, I'm willing to teach you what I know. You'll have the power to make Equestria an even better place.\nStarlight Glimmer: [hushed] How do I start?\nTwilight Sparkle: Starting is easy! All you have to do is make a friend!

Library... Library... Where did they put the library?\n[pause]\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] This castle looked a lot smaller from the outside.\n[door opens]\n[brushing]\nSpike: [muffled] Morning, Starlight!\nStarlight Glimmer: Whoops!\n[door shuts]\nStarlight Glimmer: Sorry, Spike! I guess I'm still trying to find my way around. You don't happen to know where the library is, do you?\nSpike: [muffled] Next door on the left!\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh. Thanks!\nTwilight Sparkle: Acceptance, mm-hmm. Altruism, definitely. Starlight, good morning, come in!\nStarlight Glimmer: Sorry I'm late. I got a little turned around. I still can't believe you're letting me stay here... as your pupil... after everything I did.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, I'm not one to dwell on the past, and neither should you. The castle is your home now, and as far as being my pupil goes, I was just trying to figure out what your first friendship lesson should be!\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, well, it looks like you're really narrowing it down!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, these are just the A's. After this, I move on to the B's!\n\n[theme song]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: I know I'm just learning about friendship, but I didn't think there were this many lessons for anything. How do we choose?\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe I should pare things down a bit before we go through them. Why don't you join the others in the throne room? They're planning our trip to the Crystal Empire when Shining Armor and Princess Cadance have their baby!\nStarlight Glimmer: Throne room! Got it! [beat] Um, which way is the throne room? [nervous laugh]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\n\nRainbow Dash: Well, I think we should leave ASAP. I don't want to miss the Crystalling!\nFluttershy: But, um, shouldn't we wait for the invitation?\nApplejack: Frankly, I'm not exactly clear on all the customs and traditions of the Crystal Empire, especially when it comes to a Crystalling.\nStarlight Glimmer: What's a Crystalling?\nRarity: Well, that's just it, darling. Princess Cadance and Shining Armor's baby is due any day, and we're still not sure. The Crystal Empire was gone for a thousand years. A lot of their customs are a bit murky.\nApplejack: We know it's got somethin' to do with the new baby.\nPinkie Pie: [quickly] And a party!\nFluttershy: And the Crystal Heart.\nPinkie Pie: [quickly] And a party!\nRainbow Dash: And some kinda cool energy.\nPinkie Pie: And... a party!\n[confetti explosion]\nSpike: It's not hard to understand. Most things in the Crystal Empire aren't. Like how I'm a big hero there, for example!\nRarity: [stifled giggle]\nSpike: Eh... plus, I've had to help Twilight do a lot of research on Crystallings. Whenever a baby is born in the Crystal Empire, the parents bring it before the Crystal Heart. They get the purest shard of crystal they can find, then pick a crystaller to present the baby to everypony who comes. Then they all share the light and joy they feel, feeding it into the crystal that joins with the Heart, and increases its power! And this is going to be a royal Crystalling, so pretty much the whole empire will show up. That hasn't happened in a millennia!\nStarlight Glimmer: What do you mean it increases the Crystal Heart's power?\nSpike: The energy it uses to protect the Crystal Empire, I guess.\nStarlight Glimmer: Protect it from what?\nSpike: I... didn't help Twilight with that part.\n\n[paper rustling]\nStarlight Glimmer: Hey, Twilight, can I ask you something about the Crystal Empire?\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh! Funny you should mention it. Because I just narrowed your first friendship lesson down to three options, and one of them is in the Crystal Empire!\nStarlight Glimmer: Really?\nTwilight Sparkle: I found out that's where the first pony you ever cared about lives!\nStarlight Glimmer: Sunburst?\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course, that's just one idea. We could also go to Griffonstone. [begins fading out] Making friends with a griffon is a challenge all by itself! Or we could tag along with the CMC's the next time they try to help a pony figure out why they're special...\n[high-pitched ringing]\nTwilight Sparkle: [normal] Starlight? Is something wrong?\nStarlight Glimmer: What? O-Oh, no, heh, those all sound great!\nTwilight Sparkle: I know! I guess you were right \u2013 it is gonna be hard to choose one!\nStarlight Glimmer: [laughs nervously] ...Yeah.\n\n[door opens]\n[clatter]\n[magic noises]\n[door closes]\n[door opens]\n[beat]\nStarlight Glimmer: Ugh! I am never gonna find my way around this place!\nSpike: Gee, Starlight, what's wrong?\nStarlight Glimmer: I don't know, Spike. Twilight's figuring out what my first friendship lesson is, and I guess I'm not exactly thrilled with the options. Well... with one of them.\nSpike: Which one?\nStarlight Glimmer: Reuniting me with my first friend.\nSpike: What's so terrible about that?\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] [narrating] When we were foals, Sunburst knew everything there was to know about magic. He always knew just what to do. And he was always there to help me. I guess it's not surprising that Sunburst got his cutie mark in magic and... went off to Princess Celestia's school. But when he left...\nSpike: You blamed cutie marks and stripped a whole village of theirs, and when Twilight and the others stopped you, you went back in time and almost destroyed Equestria.\n[poof]\nStarlight Glimmer: Not really stuff I'm super eager to tell Sunburst about. I mean, he's probably some big important wizard now, and... I can't even find my way around Twilight's castle.\nSpike: Well, if Sunburst is that good at magic, maybe he'd appreciate your, uh... [clears throat] exploits. You should talk to Twilight about it. I'm sure she'd want to hear what you have to say.\nStarlight Glimmer: I know. But I don't want her to think I'm not ready to learn or that I'm not grateful for everything she's doing.\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike! Come quick!\n[wind blowing]\nSpike: It's a Crystalling invitation!\nTwilight Sparkle: Shining Armor's a father! I'm an aunt! Well, this settles it! Since we're going to the Crystal Empire, your first friendship lesson is going to be... reuniting with Sunburst!\nStarlight Glimmer: Great...\n\n[train whistle]\nRainbow Dash: [yawn] Um, Applejack, what is that?\nApplejack: Oh, just a little somethin' for the young'un. Made from genuine Sweet Apple Acres apple trees. We make 'em for all the Apples, and anypony related to Twilight is practically family.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, it's okay... But it's no Cloudsdale mobile! Bam!\nPinkie Pie and Rarity: Ooh!\nPinkie Pie: Pretty!\n[shatter]\nApplejack: Well, a mobile is real nice... as long as you have somethin' to lay in so you can look at it.\nRarity: And a fetching blanket to keep you warm.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sure Shining Armor and Princess Cadance will love all our gifts. But I think they're more happy we'll be attending the baby's Crystalling.\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! I can't wait to see all that light and love make the Crystal Heart even more sparkly and shiny!\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, Pinkie, the Crystal Heart is an ancient and powerful relic. Without its magic, the Crystal Empire would be lost to the Frozen North.\nStarlight Glimmer: Wow, this Crystalling sounds pretty important. I'd understand if you wanted to... you know... wait to do a different friendship lesson when we get back.\nTwilight Sparkle: Are you kidding? This trip is perfect! Not only do I get to see the baby and take part in the ceremony that helps maintain the magic of the Crystal Empire, but I'm starting my new pupil off with the most amazing friendship lesson ever! I can't wait!\nStarlight Glimmer: Right... Me neither... [beat] Actually, Twilight, I am a little worried about meeting Sunburst.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, trust me. I know what it's like to see old friends. But I'll be right there to help things along. I've broken the whole lesson down into a few easy steps to ensure this reunion goes off without a hitch!\nStarlight Glimmer: [laughs nervously]\n\n[train chuffing]\nTwilight Sparkle: [reading] Step one, head to Sunburst's house and get you two started on the right hoof. Step two, get to the castle with enough time to visit the ba\u2014\n[thump]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Shining Armor!\nShining Armor: [tired] Twilight...!\nTwilight Sparkle: I didn't know you were meeting us!\nShining Armor: [tired] Of course I am! It's me, right here. Here I am. Why wouldn't I come meet my sister? Though we have met before, heh-heh...\nTwilight Sparkle: Are you all right?\nShining Armor: [tired] Never better! Being a father is amazing! And wonderful, and amazing, and confusing, and amazing, but surprising too, you know? I mean, not that you'd know. You wouldn't know, I know... You know? [beat] Sorry. I haven't really slept since Cadance had the baby. Come to think of it, she hasn't either. It sure would be great to get a break.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, of course! I don't know what I was thinking! You two probably need all kinds of help! I'm sorry, Starlight, but I guess combining your first lesson with this visit wasn't such a good idea.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, uh, don't be ridiculous! You're an aunt now! That's way more important than some friendship lesson.\nTwilight Sparkle: I just wish there was a way to do both.\nSpike: Maybe there is! You've already done the work for Starlight's lesson with this list. All we have to do is follow it!\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, you're a genius!\nStarlight Glimmer: [through nervous laugh] Yeah... [through gritted teeth] genius.\nTwilight Sparkle: Then it's settled! Shining Armor and I will head straight to the castle, and you two can head straight to Sunburst's!\nSpike: Aye-aye, Princess!\nStarlight Glimmer: [nervously] Uh-huh.\nTwilight Sparkle: Alright, big brother, let's go see this amazing baby pony!\nShining Armor: [snoring] Ahhh... the baby...\n\nSpike: I know you're a little worried about this reunion, but I'm sure Twilight's got everything covered.\nStarlight Glimmer: Everything except how I'd rather do absolutely anything else.\nSpike: Oh, I bet she's taken that into account too. It's all part of the lesson. Trust the lesson.\nStarlight Glimmer: Right... [beat] Hey, i-is that... you?\nSpike: Oh, yep, it sure is! Now, according to the list, Sunburst's house is\u2014\nStarlight Glimmer: Why is there a statue of you in the Crystal Empire?\n\"Scarlet Heart\": Because Spike the Brave and Glorious saved all of us from King Sombra!\n\"Amber Laurel\": And then again during the Equestria Games!\nStarlight Glimmer: Really?\n\"Golden V\u00e4s\": Really! [to Spike] Big fan.\nStarlight Glimmer: Um, when were you going to tell me about this?\nSpike: Nah, it's no big deal.\nCrystal Ponies: It most certainly is!\nStarlight Glimmer: That's it! We're not going anywhere until I get the whole story!\n\nShining Armor: Before we go in, I should probably tell you. Seeing the baby might be a bit of a shock.\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on, big brother. I've met babies before. I expect meeting this one won't be any different. [gasps]\nFlurry Heart: [coos]\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course, I could be wrong.\n\nFlurry Heart: [burbling]\nTwilight Sparkle: The baby is an Alicorn?!\nPrincess Cadance: [tired] It looks that way.\nRarity: But... But... But I thought Alicorn wings had to be earned by accomplishing some great, princess-worthy deed!\nApplejack: Yeah. How can you just be born with 'em?\nPrincess Celestia: The birth of an Alicorn is something Equestria has never seen!\nPrincess Luna: It is beyond even our understanding.\nFluttershy: [hushed] That's not very reassuring.\nPinkie Pie: Wow! A unicorn, and a Pegasus! So she could be a super-strong flyer and have crazy baby magic!\nRainbow Dash: Well, I know all about super-strong flying!\nTwilight Sparkle: And I can help keep tabs on her magic!\nFlurry Heart: [sneezes] [burbles]\nPrincess Celestia: It appears her magic is more powerful than that of a newborn unicorn!\nPrincess Luna: The crowds have already started to gather.\nPinkie Pie: [inhales] [blows balloon] This Crystalling is gonna be some party!\n[balloon pops]\nPrincess Cadance: Do you think we should call it off?\nRainbow Dash: Um, we've all faced a lot worse than baby magic.\nRarity: I can't imagine cancelling such a beautiful and important ceremony over something so potentially adorable!\nApplejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash: [general agreement]\nPrincess Celestia: In light of the little one's abilities, this Crystalling might be more important than ever. [to Cadance] Perhaps you should address your subjects and remind them of that.\nPrincess Cadance: Hm. [kisses]\nFlurry Heart: [baby noise]\nShining Armor: [snoring]\nTwilight Sparkle: Shining Armor! Do you have everything you need for the ceremony?\nShining Armor: [tired] Huh? Oh, no! I still have to interview the honor guards, choose the purity crystal, and pick a crystaller!\nTwilight Sparkle: Alright, take it easy. Pinkie can stay here with me and keep an eye on the baby.\nPinkie Pie: [squee]\nFlurry Heart: [giggles]\nApplejack: And we'll all help you with everythin' else.\nShining Armor: [snores] ...baby...\nRarity: That is, if you can stay awake long enough to tell us how.\n\nSpike: ...and that's how we found the Crystal Heart, defeated King Sombra, and saved the Empire.\n[Crystal Ponies cheering]\n\"Cloudy Spinel\": We love you, Spike!\n\"Coral Shores\": Yeah. Tell the one about the Equestria Games!\nSpike: Well, as much as I love reliving my heroic deeds, Starlight and I have an important lesson to do, by order of the Princess of Friendship!\nFoals: Awwww!\nStarlight Glimmer: Aw, come on, Spike! I want to hear about the Games too!\n[scribbling]\nSpike: I know you're nervous about seeing Sunburst, but it says right in step 3, to, uh, \"Deal with your fears by facing them, not by putting it off.\"\nStarlight Glimmer: Ugh. Let's go get this over with.\n\nSpike: Wait!\nStarlight Glimmer: Huh? What?!\nSpike: Knocking on the door isn't the next thing on the list!\nStarlight Glimmer: Seriously?\nSpike: I know Twilight can be a little nitpicky, but this is your first lesson as her pupil, and it's important that we do it right!\nStarlight Glimmer: Fine. What's the next thing on the list?\nSpike: [clears throat] [reading] \"Before they see each other, be sure to highlight the importance of the meeting.\"\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm pretty sure we can skip that.\nSpike: I don't know... I mean if we skip it, the whole lesson could go south! And then you might end up taking a giant step backwards instead of forwards! Maybe you'll never be able to learn anything about friendship at all! It's almost like your whole future depends on this moment. [beat] \"Highlight the importance of the meeting\" \u2013 check! I can't believe you wanted to skip that!\n[knocking]\n[long beat]\n[door opens]\nStarlight Glimmer: Sunburst?\nSunburst: Yes? What can I do for you?\nStarlight Glimmer: It's... It's me, Starlight. We used to be friends?\nSunburst: [beat] Oh, of course! S-Starlight! My goodness, it-it's been a long time! What, uh, what have you been up to?\nStarlight Glimmer: Me? Oh! You know, some of this, some of that, different... stuff. Right now, I'm sort of Twilight Sparkle's new pupil.\nSunburst: The Princess of Friendship?\nStarlight Glimmer: Heh... yeah... that's actually kind of why I'm here. I mean, I know you're probably very busy.\nSunburst: What do you mean?\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, I figured after magic school, you'd go on to do important wizard work, but...\nSunburst: Oh. No. Y-Yes! Uh, y-yes, that's me, yup. [nervous chuckle] Important wizard! Really busy with lots of, uh, wi-wizarding... stuff. [beat] Right. Uh, well... good to see you.\n[door closes]\nSpike: Huh. Maybe we should have skipped highlighting the importance of the meeting after all.\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, I guess that's that!\nSpike: Starlight, come on! We have to at least explain what Twilight wants!\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans]\n[knocking]\n[door opens]\n\nPrincess Cadance: [tired, amplified] Dearest citizens, I am sure you are all just as thrilled and ready for this Crystalling as myself and Shining Armor.\n[crowd cheering]\nShining Armor: [panicked breathing] I'm not ready!\nRainbow Dash: Take it easy! Just pick whoever looks the most like honor guard material.\nShining Armor: Right... right.\n[thump]\nRoyal guards: [whimpering]\nShining Armor: I'm sorry. Fatherhood is way more stressful than I ever thought.\nFluttershy: I can only imagine.\nRarity: Now, I know choosing the crystal of purity is a very important decision. So I have gone through the trouble of arranging them in order from incredibly pure to outrageously pure.\nFluttershy: Um, Rarity, don't they all sort of look the same?\nRarity: Oh, well, to the untrained eye, perhaps. What do you think, Shining Armor?\nShining Armor: [incoherent stammering] I don't know!\nRarity: [hushed] I hope Twilight and Pinkie are having better luck with the baby!\n\nFlurry Heart: [burbling]\nPinkie Pie: Well... at least she's having... fun!\n[magic zaps]\nPinkie Pie: Whee!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie, hold her still!\nPinkie Pie: I'm tryiiiiiiing!\n\nSunburst: So... the Princess of Friendship wants you and I to be friends again?\nStarlight Glimmer: Heh, I know. Weird, right?\nSunburst: Uh, I don't understand. Did something happen to you after I left for magic school?\nStarlight Glimmer: What?\n[thump]\nStarlight Glimmer: No! I-I don't see what that has to do with anything. W-Why would you even ask that?\n[tea pouring]\nStarlight Glimmer: I mean, did something happen to you after you left for magic school?\nSunburst: What? Um, no. L-Like you said, I'm a, [clears throat] i-important wizard.\nSpike: I'm sure there's something on Twilight's list that can help here.\n\nShining Armor: [heavy breathing]\n[door opens]\nShining Armor: Okay. I chose the honor guard, picked the purity crystal, and I know exactly who I want to be our crystaller. So, all we need is...\nPrincess Cadance: The baby?\n[beat]\nTwilight Sparkle: We're here!\nFlurry Heart: [burbling]\nPinkie Pie: She's a really strong flyer!\n[magic bubbling]\nFlurry Heart: [sniffling] [loud crying]\n[cracking]\n[shattering]\nEverypony: [gasps]\nFlurry Heart: [burbling]\nApplejack: I'm guessin' that's gonna make it harder to do the Crystalling.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's worse than that.

The city wasn't covered in snow then!\nTwilight Sparkle: The Heart wasn't missing. It was still in the castle. King Sombra had just hidden it.\nPrincess Celestia: I'm afraid Twilight is correct, and the storm clouds are already forming.\n[lightning cracks]\nRainbow Dash: I can totally fly up there and bust those puppies! No problem!\nPrincess Celestia: I wouldn't advise it, Rainbow Dash. Those storm clouds are not like the ones you know.\nPrincess Luna: This far north, the weather has a will of its own, and now it will only grow stronger, enveloping everything in its path.\nPrincess Cadance: Including the Crystal Empire!\nTwilight Sparkle: And us along with it!\n\nSpike: There's gotta be somethin'...\nSunburst: I know Princess Twilight is keen on the two of us rekindling our friendship, but... it's been so long. I don't see how anything on that list is going to help.\nStarlight Glimmer: I know, right? It's not like there's some spell that would magically compel us to pick up where we left off.\nSunburst: Well, actually, there's several. Mistmane's Material Amity, Rockhoof's Rapport, Flash Prance's Fellow... ship...

There's a good chance we can find something there!\nTwilight Sparkle: Can you hold off the storm?\nPrincess Luna: Yes, for a time, but even our magic will eventually succumb to the power of the Frozen North.\nPrincess Celestia: We will do what we can, but you must hurry.\n[magic zaps]\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know how long it will take to find the right spell, but you should probably tell the crowd outside to get somewhere warm!\nPrincess Cadance: And try not to mention the Crystal Heart. We don't want to start a panic.\nApplejack: Yes, ma'am. C'mon, girls!\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm gonna need all of your help. The crystal library is enormous!\nShining Armor: You can count on us, Twily!\nFlurry Heart: [giggles]\n[magic pop]\nPinkie Pie: [shrieks]\n[magic pop]\nShining Armor: Where'd she go?!\nFlurry Heart: [distant giggling]\nPrincess Cadance: This way!\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, Spike, looks like my biggest fears came true. I wouldn't be surprised if Twilight decides to give up on me entirely.\nSpike: Aw, it's not your fault. I'm the one who said all we needed was this list. [blows fire]\nStarlight Glimmer: It's not the list, Spike. Or you. Or Twilight. I'm the one Sunburst doesn't want to be friends with.\nSpike: I don't remember him saying he didn't want to be friends.\nStarlight Glimmer: He didn't have to say it.\nSpike: Well, Twilight obviously thinks you're worth being friends with! And I do too!\nStarlight Glimmer: Thanks, Spike. At least I have two friends, even if one of them has dragon breath.\nSpike: [exhales] Uh, that's not dragon breath. It's freezing!\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, you're right! But I thought the Crystal Heart was supposed to keep the cold weather out.\nSpike: It is... unless something's happened! Come on!\n\nRainbow Dash: We're just saying that it might not be the best idea to stay outside!\n\"Tough Nut\": I camped out all night for this spot! I'm not about to just give it up!\nFluttershy: Still, when you think about it, the view is just as good a little further back, like... inside your house?\n[Crystal Ponies complaining]\n\"Scouts Honor\": The Crystalling ceremony is one of our most sacred traditions! And when that foal is held before the Crystal Heart, I plan to be as close to the action as possible!\nApplejack: Honestly, I don't know if there's gonna be a Crystallin'. The truth is, the baby's an Alicorn and her magic's plum crazy, so you might not wanna be that close after all.\n\"Tough Nut\": A baby Alicorn? Wow, I can't wait to see that!\n\"Scouts Honor\": Oh, those little wings are probably so cute!\n\"Mustafa Combe\": I know, right?\nRainbow Dash: Look, I am a hundred percent sure the Crystalling isn't happening.\n[magic zaps]\n\"Mustafa Combe\": No Crystalling, huh? Then why are they starting the fireworks show?\n[Crystal Ponies cheering]\n\nFlurry Heart: [giggling throughout]\nShining Armor: Young filly... come back here!\nPinkie Pie: Come to your Auntie Pinkie Pie!\nTwilight Sparkle: Bridle Buck's Boat Chants, Hayhoof's Intonements, Mystic Maps and Mazes... [groans] Anything up there?\n[magic pop]\nPrincess Cadance: Not yet! I'm not even sure how these are organized!\n[magic pop]\nFlurry Heart: [giggling] [sneezes]\n[magic pops]\nPrincess Cadance: Shining Armor, I thought you were taking care of the baby!\nShining Armor: I'm trying!\n[magic pops]\nFlurry Heart: Whoo!\nRarity: Gotcha!\n[magic pops]\nRarity: Oh! Or not...\nFlurry Heart: [continued giggling]\n[continued magic zaps]\nPinkie Pie: Whoa!\n[crash]\nStarlight Glimmer: What is going on?!\nPinkie Pie: You want the long or the short version?\nStarlight Glimmer: Short?\nPinkie Pie: [quickly] The baby's an Alicorn and she accidentally destroyed the Crystal Heart, so Twilight and Cadance are looking for a spell to put it back together and save the Crystal Empire from turning into a giant wasteland of ice and snow.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh.\n[crunch]\nPrincess Cadance: [gasps] What about this? Trotter's Tome of Reliquary?\n[pages turning]\nTwilight Sparkle: I think this is it!\nPrincess Cadance: [reading] \"Spell of Relic Reconstitution\"! I can't believe we found it!\nTwilight Sparkle: It's a good thing, too! Without this, I don't know what we'd do!\n[magic pop]\nFlurry Heart: [giggling]\n[thump]\n[magic zaps]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\nPinkie Pie: Oops.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: That spell was the only thing we found in the whole library that was even close to what we needed!\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm so sorry, Twilight!\nTwilight Sparkle: It's not your fault, Starlight. None of us were expecting any of this.\nPrincess Cadance: Do you think you can remember the spell?\nTwilight Sparkle: I only read it through once!\nRarity: Well, if anypony can exactly remember something she read for the first time two minutes ago, it's you, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'll try. But I'm not sure how long it'll take.\n[wind blowing]\nPinkie Pie: Is quickly an option?\nPrincess Cadance: I'll help if I can, but we should evacuate the city just in case! You need to lead everypony to the train station before the tracks freeze over!\nShining Armor: We will. But between you and Twilight, I'm sure you'll remember the spell.\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: I only hope this spell is the one we need.\nStarlight Glimmer: Is there anything I can do?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't think so. I'm just sorry about your lesson.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, that doesn't matter now. Sunburst and I don't have anything in common anyway. He's a big important wizard! And I'm re-learning everything I ever thought I knew.\nPrincess Cadance: Sunburst? I don't recognize the name, but if he's an important wizard, you should bring him here. Maybe he'll know what to do if the spell fails.\nStarlight Glimmer: [gasps] Of course!\nTwilight Sparkle: You better go with her, Spike.\n[thunder cracks]\n[magic zaps]\n\n[door opens]\nStarlight Glimmer: [straining] Sunburst! Haven't you looked outside?!\nSunburst: Snow? That's... not right. The Crystal Heart\u2014\nStarlight Glimmer: Is gone! The baby \u2013 Shining Armor and Cadance's baby \u2013 it's an Alicorn!\nSunburst: Really?\nStarlight Glimmer: Really! And her magic is a little berserk, and well, I guess she destroyed the Heart! But Twilight thinks she can fix it and Princess Cadance thought you could help!\nSunburst: Me?\nStarlight Glimmer: Of course! You're an important wizard in the Crystal Empire! It just makes sense!\nSunburst: Right... right... right right right. You know, I'd like to help, I-I really would. I-I just have so much, um, important wizard work to do around here.\nSpike and Starlight Glimmer: Huh?!\n\n[wind howling]\nApplejack: You can't stay here!\n\"Mustafa Combe\": Did I mention this was a Royal Crystalling? When the crystaller holds the young one aloft, all of the Empire will share their joy and light, and the Crystal Heart will beat stronger than it ever has before!\n\"Scouts Honor\": It really is a moving ceremony!\nFluttershy: I really don't think it's going to happen.\nRainbow Dash: Come on, it's freezing out here!\n\"Tough Nut\": Uh, this is the Crystal Empire. We've seen snow before.\nShining Armor: Not like this! We don't have time to argue! Princess Cadance has decided to evacuate the city!\n[crowd gasps]\n\"Mustafa Combe\": But the Crystalling...!\nShining Armor: I don't know if we'll ever have another Crystalling again! The Crystal Heart... is shattered.\n[crowd gasps]\n\"Tough Nut\": It's not safe here!\nApplejack: [groan] That's what we've been tryin' to tell you!\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Sunburst, I know you're busy, but did you hear what I said?\nSunburst: Oh, I heard you, but-but like I said, when you're an important wizard, the work just piles up.\nStarlight Glimmer: Sunburst!\nSunburst: [sighs] Look, Starlight, I want to help. I do. But I can't. I wish I could.\nStarlight Glimmer: What do you mean?!\nSunburst: Fixing an ancient relic? I-I can't even come close to doing something like that!\nStarlight Glimmer: But I thought you were an important wizard!\nSunburst: Well, you were wrong, okay?! I'm not an important wizard! I'm not even a wizard at all!\n\nSunburst: I know it's hard for you to understand, but not all of us end up achieving greatness.\nStarlight Glimmer: What? Why wouldn't I understand that?\nSunburst: Really? You're the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Princess of Friendship! I don't think she picks just anypony for that!\nSpike: Technically, she's more of a student than a prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nSunburst: Whatever. I'm sorry I'm not the big important wizard you were expecting.\nStarlight Glimmer: Sunburst, I don't care if you're a wizard or not. I'm just surprised. You always knew so much about magic. I mean, look at all these books!\nSunburst: Yeah, well, reading about magic is one thing, but you don't know what it was like at magic school! To know so much and not be able to do any of it!\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, you don't know what it was like to be left behind! And then getting so bitter that you steal the cutie marks from an entire village and then get defeated by Twilight and her friends, so you travel through time to get back at them, but they beat you again and teach you about friendship, but you're so terrified ponies will find out what you did that you can't make any friends!\n[long beat]\nSunburst: Did you really travel through time?\nSpike: See? I told you he'd be impressed.\nSunburst: I'm sorry we lost touch. Maybe if I had reached out, you could have helped me at magic school, and I could have helped you to...\nStarlight Glimmer: Not become totally evil? [sighs] Let's just say I know what it's like to have something you're not exactly proud of.\nSunburst: When you showed up thinking I was some big wizard... I'm sorry. I should have told you the truth.\nStarlight Glimmer: It's fine. At least we worked it all out. I think Twilight would be proud of us.\nSpike: Well, if you ever want to tell her about it, we should probably leave now!\nStarlight Glimmer: [gasps] I forgot to tell you! They're evacuating the city! You need to get to the train station, unless you've got a spell here that will drive back the Frozen North and fix the Crystal Heart so the baby can have her Crystalling?\nSunburst: Crystalling...! Of course!\n\n[magic zaps]\nPrincess Celestia and Princess Luna: [straining]\nPrincess Celestia: Push them back, my sister!\n[ponies panicking]\nShining Armor: This way!\n[thud]\nRainbow Dash: Ugh!\nApplejack: Just a little bit further, y'all! The station's just ahead!\nStarlight Glimmer: We have to go back!\nSunburst: I know how to stop this!\n\n[scribbling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, I think that's everything?\nPrincess Cadance: It looks right to me, but... there's only one way to find out!\n[magic zaps, shards tinkling]\n[shattering]\nTwilight Sparkle: The spell failed. I don't know what else to do.\nPrincess Celestia: An old student of mine believes he does.\nSunburst: The baby did this?!\nTwilight Sparkle: I tried putting it back together with\u2014\nSunburst: The spell of Relic Reconstitution. No, that won't do it. The Crystal Heart's been around for millennia. Restoring a relic like this is way beyond one spell. You need to combine it with something else. Something unique to the relic itself. Something that strengthens it and provides it with power...?\n[beat]\nTwilight Sparkle: The Crystalling!\nSunburst: Combining that spell with the light and love of everypony gathered for the ceremony, together with... Somnambula's Weather Abjuration to clear away the snow... and a little Fledgling's Forbearance for the parents... Heh. That should curb the little one's power fluctuations.\nFlurry Heart: [giggles]\nPrincess Cadance: You must be Sunburst. Starlight said you were a powerful wizard.\nSunburst: Oh, I'm no wizard.\nApplejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie and Rarity: [gasps]\nRainbow Dash: What?\nStarlight Glimmer: But he studied magic his whole life! You should see his house! And since nopony has any better ideas, what do we have to lose?!\nShining Armor: I had planned on asking Twilight to be our crystaller, but since it seems like she'll be busy...\nSunburst: I'd be honored!\nFlurry Heart: [giggling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, what are we waiting for?!\n[magic zaps, shards tinkling]\nTwilight Sparkle: [straining]\n[magic zaps]\n[wind blowing]\n[magic shimmering]\nFlurry Heart: [giggling]\nSunburst: Citizens! May I present the newest member of the Crystal Empire!\nFlurry Heart: [laughs]\n[crowd cheers]\n\"Mustafa Combe\": She's beautiful!\n\"Scouts Honor\": Oh! It's just so moving!\n[magic noises]\nFlurry Heart: [giggles]\n[Crystal Ponies cheering]\n[magic zap]\n\"Tough Nut\": Best Crystalling ever!\nStarlight Glimmer: For a pony who isn't great at magic, you did pretty well.\nPrincess Celestia: Indeed. I'm glad to see you've found a way to share your unique gift, Sunburst. You may be more of a wizard than you think.\n\nNight Light: You would not believe the crazy weather that delayed our train. Came out of nowhere.\nTwilight Velvet: But it was all worth it to see this peaceful little angel! Awww, so sweet! Come to your grandmare!\nFlurry Heart: [giggles]\nApplejack: Yeah, peaceful now, anyway.\nTwilight Sparkle: I suppose that spell really did the trick!\nFlurry Heart: [inhales for sneeze]\nMane Six: [shrieks]\nFlurry Heart: [sneezes]\n[beat]\nShining Armor: We have Sunburst to thank for that.\nPrincess Cadance: I hope he takes his role as crystaller seriously. Something tells me the baby will need a pony like him to look to for magical advice.\nTwilight Velvet: Cadance, darling, aren't we gonna name the poor little dear, or are we gonna spend our entire visit just calling her \"the baby\"?\nPrincess Cadance: We were thinking... \"Flurry Heart\".\nShining Armor: You know, to remember the occasion.\nRarity: Oh, goodness, how could anypony forget?\nTwilight Sparkle: I think it's lovely. [kisses]\nFlurry Heart: [giggles]\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, I think you're the Crystal Empire's big important wizard, whether you like it or not.\nSunburst: I don't know if I'll have time for any wizarding. I'm a crystaller now. That's a big responsibility.\nStarlight Glimmer: I can't think of anypony more qualified. Just... promise you'll stay in touch?\nSunburst: Hm, like I'd ever lose touch with my oldest friend.\nSpike: What's wrong, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know, Spike. I think I have a lot to learn about being a teacher.\nSpike: What are you talking about? Your lesson went perfectly! Starlight and Sunburst got over their past and rekindled their friendship!\nTwilight Sparkle: No thanks to me. I know a lot happened. I just wish I could have given my pupil the attention she deserves.\nSpike: Well, I know she needed to be put on the right path, but giving her the space to make her own decisions worked pretty well. Isn't that how Celestia taught you?\nTwilight Sparkle: You know, I never thought about it! But I guess it is!\nSpike: Maybe you're a better teacher than you thought.\n[train chuffing]\n\n[triumphant music over credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[train chuffing]\nPinkie Pie: [singsong] We're going to Manehattan, we're going to Manehattan, we're going to Manehattan...!\nRarity: [nonplussed] Yes, yes, Manehattan, the height of sophistication, elegance, culture... Since my boutique in Canterlot has been doing so nicely, it only makes sense for me to open one there as well.\nPinkie Pie: [squeals] We're almost there! Why doesn't your face look like this?! Eee...\nRarity: Oh, Pinkie, dear, this is just a business trip for me. I need to scour the city for the most perfect location for my new shop. And while it's lovely how excited you are, there's absolutely no chance of me getting swept into the\u2013 [gasps] [suddenly excited] energy, the beauty, the majesty of the greatest city in all of Equestria!\n[doors open]\nRarity: [sighs] This city's simply a-ma-zing! It's just... everything, ever!\nPinkie Pie: And it's about to get everything ever-er! Because guess who I see! M-A-U-D! You know what that spells?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] It spells Maud.\nPinkie Pie: [squee]\n[party cannon fires]\nPinkie Pie: Maud, Maud, Maud! Yay!\n\n[theme song]\n\nRarity: Oh, you Pie sisters have just about the sweetest family traditions! Every year, you set aside a special day to spend with each of your sisters?\nPinkie Pie: Yep! I do separate trips with each one, and we make it super fun by picking a different location every year! We see the sights all day and then swap gifts at sunset! And since Maud's getting her rocktorate nearby, we figured this would be the perfect spot for PSSSD!\nRarity: [hushed] Okay, what's the secret?\nPinkie Pie: Huh?\nRarity: You just said 'pssst'.\nPinkie Pie: No, silly! Not pssst, PSSSD! P-S-S-S-D! Pie Sisters Surprise Swap Day!\n[stallion snorts]\nPinkie Pie: [giggles nervously]\nRarity: Maud!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Boulder promised his cousin a postcard.\nRarity: Well, I'll just leave you two to your PSSSD. And now, I am off to scout possible locations for my new boutique!\nPinkie Pie: Before you go, can I ask you a quick question?\nRarity: Oh, of course.\nPinkie Pie: [loudly] Will you please help me?!\nRarity: [nervously] Only if you let go of my leg and stand up...\nPinkie Pie: Every year, Maud's PSSSD gift always blows mine away! But this year is going to be different! For the first time, I'm finally getting her a gift that's as good as the one she always gets me! There's a specialty store here in Manehattan that sells nothing but rock pouches! A rock pouch would be perfect for Boulder, and I know Maud will love it!\nRarity: Why, Pinkie, that really is the perfect gift for Maud!\nPinkie Pie: I know, right? Problem is, I still need to buy one, and the store is downtown!\nRarity: Hmm, and you want to get a pouch for Maud without ruining the surprise... Well, luckily for you, I know exactly what you should do! Why not sight-see on a path that leads right to the pouch store? That way Maud won't get suspicious! I'll come with you to distract Maud, so...\nPinkie Pie: ...I can sneak away to pick out a rock pouch! [gasps] And if you're coming with us, you can look at boutique locations along the way! [shouting] It's the perfect plan! [echoes out]\nRarity: Y-Yes, yes, yes, let's not get too excited until you actually get a pouch for Maud.\nPinkie Pie: Of course. Got it. Absolutely.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Nothing moved him.\nPinkie Pie: Maud! I'm giving you the greatest PSSSD gift in the history of ever!\n[party cannon fires]\n\nRarity: Oh, what a spectacular view! You really can see everything from here!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Especially the glaciation of the sloping strata. It's breathtaking.\nPinkie Pie: But not half as breathtaking as the gift I'm giving you!\n[party cannon fires]\n\nRarity: I-It certainly is\u2013 [grunts] \u2013cozy... but this simply won't do! Working in a space this small would make me lose my mind!\nPinkie Pie: Just like Maud's gonna lose her mind when she sees the gift I'm giving her!\n[party cannon fires]\n\n[skating sounds]\nRarity: [inhales]\nPinkie Pie: Whatever you were about to say isn't nearly as good as the gift I'm giving Maud!\n[party cannon fires]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] You'll be pleased with yours too.\n\n[drawing noises]\nRarity: Pinkie, put down that crayon! The Cantering Cook isn't that kind of restaurant!\nPinkie Pie: [spits]\n[splash]\nRarity: Oh... A pony could get used to eating at places like this!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I know. It's the only restaurant in the city with nepheline syenite in their bathroom tiles.\nRarity: [stutters] ...Well, isn't that something! [deliberately] You know what, Pinkie Pie? Uh, maybe you could help me figure out what to order!\nPinkie Pie: [hushed] We're so close to the pouch store! It's just a block away! I could practically smell it from here! If I knew what a pouch store smelled like.\n[beat]\nRarity: [hushed] Okay, remember the plan. I will stay here and distract Maud while you go get a pouch!\nPinkie Pie: [hushed] Gotcha!\nRarity: [deliberately] Oh, why, thank you for the kind assistance, Pinkie Pie. And now I know exactly what to order.\nPinkie Pie: [deliberately] You are very welcome, Rarity! Now pardon me whilst I go wash my hooves!\n[thump]\nPinkie Pie: Sorry!\nRarity: So, Maud... that Boulder of yours is such an interesting... ahem... character. You must tell me, how did the two of you first meet?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] It was a dark and stormy night. Little did I know that my life was about to change forever.\n\n[cash register rings]\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] Look at that hand-stitched ten-thousand-thread-count velvet-lined rock pouch! Maud will love it! I need it!\n[crash]\nPinkie Pie: Ungh! Huh, must be stuck! [reading] \"Took a sudden vacation to Canterlot with my grandniece. Back in a few moons.\" Oh, no. Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no-no! Well, maybe, just maybe, he's already back from vacation and just forgot to take the sign down! [shouting and pounding on door] Hello, Mr. Pouch Store Owner! I'd like to hear all about your sudden vacation in Canterlot with your grandniece while buying a pouch for my sister please!\nDeputy Copper: Miss, the store's clearly closed.\nPinkie Pie: But it can't be. It just can't be! If I can't get that pouch... then not only am I not getting my sister the greatest present in the history of PSSSD, but now I have no PSSSD present for my sister at all!\n\n[door opens]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] ...and Boulder's been by my side ever since.\nRarity: [deadpan] Wow. What a surprisingly suspenseful and compelling story. I completely get what you see in him now. [gasps] Pinkie Pie, you're back!

One super-deluxe two-mile-high hot fudge sundae, stat!\n[thump]\nRarity: What happened? Did you get a pouch for Maud? Tell me everything!\nPinkie Pie: [inhales] [quickly] The door to the rock pouch store is locked because the owner's on a sudden vacation to Canterlot with his grandniece for a few moons, and so there's no way I can get the perfect present for Maud, and now I don't have any present for her at all, so it'll be the worst Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day ever! [inhales]\n[splat]\nPinkie Pie: [muffled sobbing]\nRarity: Oh, not to worry, dear! I'll just have to help you find a new present for Maud. We have plenty of time before your gift exchange at sunset and all of Manehattan to explore. We're bound to find something Maud would like. Maybe even more than a rock pouch!\nPinkie Pie: You're right! Thanks, Rarity!\n\n[My Little Pony theme on piano interrupted by upwards glissando]\nRarity: Maud, I can't help but notice you're staring at that marvelous giraffe. I was just wondering, any chance you could see yourself with it?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Only if I had a mirror.\n\nRarity: Now, Maud, I know you're a big fan of rocks, so get your camera ready, because these are the most spectacular rocks in all of Manehattan! Surely there must be something here that catches your eye.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] [hushed] Boulder says they're all too... stuck-up.\n\n[Western-themed music]\nRarity: [whistles] All right. You and me, Maud, you and me. What do you think about... this? Or this? Or this? Or this? Or this? Or this? Or this? This? This? This? This? This? [repeats, accelerating into gibberish]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I like... that.\nRarity: What is it? You have to tell me! Was it this bike? This lamp? This grappling hook? What do you like?!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I like that fissure in the sidewalk. It's an elegant example of thermal expansion and soil settlement.\n[camera flashes]\n[sound of kettle boiling]\nRarity: Fissure in thhhhhhhe soil...? What?! But I...! All of this...! And she likes a crack?!\n[pop]\nPinkie Pie: Did she like anything?\nRarity: [hushed] That sister of yours is simply impossible to shop for! There's nothing she needs or wants!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] [calling out] Boulder. Boulder. Where'd you run off to? There you are. Sure wish I had something to carry you around in.\nPinkie Pie: A rock pouch was the perfect gift for Maud! Aw, and I know she would have loved the one I saw in the window! It had double stitching, a red drawstring...\nRarity: ...and ochre-flecked velvet lining with reinforced triple-crosshatched seams?\nPinkie Pie: Yep, that's the pouch. [beat] Wait, how'd you know?\nRarity: Because I'm looking at one just like it! Maybe if you can catch up with him, you could ask\u2014\n[zoom]\nPinkie Pie: Excuse me, sir! I couldn't help but notice your nifty rock pouch! Is there any chance you'd be willing to part with it? I really need it. Like, really really really!\n\"Street Rat\": So lemme get this straight: You, uh, really really need this pouch, huh?\nPinkie Pie: I believe I said really really really.\n\"Street Rat\": Well, you know, pouches like this are really hard to come by these days. But I might be able to part with it for the right price.\nPinkie Pie: So you'll sell it to me? And I'll finally be able to give my sister the perfect Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day present? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!\n[party cannon fires]\n\"Street Rat\": Hmmm. That's one sweet party cannon you got there. Tell you what. I'd be more than happy to give you the pouch for the low, low price of... that cannon.\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] M-My... party cannon...?\n\"Street Rat\": Well, if you really wanna give that sister of yours the perfect present, then you'll have to give up your party cannon. So, what do you say? The pouch for the cannon.\n[ding]\n\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Do you see the exposed chalcedony in the fissure?\nRarity: Probably?\nPinkie Pie: [despondent] What you guys lookin' at?\nRarity: Oh, you're back! [to Maud] Darling, I want to get one more picture of you with that astounding fissure in the sidewalk, and the inspiration just struck me for the perfect shot! Uh, be a dear and go stand behind it. Okay, now just, uh, back up a little bit! Little more! And now just a little... uh... twenty yards more! Perfect! Hold that pose! I think we found your new holiday card! [hushed, to Pinkie] So, how did it go? Tell me, tell me, tell me!\nPinkie Pie: [despondent] Well, I got the rock pouch for Maud, and... that's really the only thing that matters.\nRarity: Oh, I am so glad to hear that! She's going to absolutely love it!\nPinkie Pie: [despondent] Yup.\nRarity: \"Yup\"? That's it? You got your sister the greatest PSSSD present in the history of ever, and all you have to say is \"yup\"?\nPinkie Pie: [despondent] Yup.\nRarity: But... you're Pinkie Pie. You're supposed to be all [quickly] \"Oh, I'm so excited I bought the rock pouch! And I know I say excited a lot when I'm actually just kind of excited, but this time I'm really excited about how excited I am about being this excited over the rock pouch!\" [normally] And then you fire off your party cannon. Say, where is your cannon? [gasps] Did you lose it? Is your party cannon lost somewhere in the big city?!\nPinkie Pie: [despondent] Well... I wouldn't say it's lost. I mean, I know where it is. It's just... [sighs]\nRarity: I can clearly see that something's bothering you, and I want to help. But I can't help you unless you tell me what the problem is.\nPinkie Pie: [despondent] Oh, there's no problem. It just turns out that the going rate for a rock pouch in Manehattan is one party cannon. Who knew?\nRarity: You gave away your cannon?! But, but that party cannon is your everything! You absolutely love that cannon! How could you possibly part with something that means so much to you?!\nPinkie Pie: Well, I finally got Maud a gift that's just as good as the ones she always gets me, and that's all that really matters.\nRarity: Well, I guess I understand... maybe.\nPinkie Pie: Maud's going to be so excited. I can't wait to see the look on her face when she sees the pouch!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I know, the camera loves Boulder.\n\nRarity: After the day we've had, I'm probably looking forward to the swap part of the Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day even more than the two of you! [giggles] And I'm not even a Pie sister! I can't wait one more second to see the wonderful gifts you've gotten each other!\nPinkie Pie: Well, you're going to have to. We don't just swap, silly. We always sing the Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day Song first! Ready, Maud?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] As I'll ever be.\n[Pinkie Pie]\nIt's the Pie Sisters' Swap Day Sooooooong!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Hey.\nPinkie Pie: Okay, time to swap presents! Hmmmm. [licks]\n[beat]\nRarity: [growls] Just open them already!\n[paper ripping]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Thanks.\nPinkie Pie: I knew you'd love it! It was all worth it! Look how happy she is! And I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you, Rarity. Okay! Time to open your present to me! Oh! You did it again! You got me the best present in the history of PSSSD! This is perfect! This is amazing! This is incredible! I love it, I love it, I love it! [beat] What is it?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] It's little pieces of cupcake-scented paper. You know, confetti. For your cannon.\nPinkie Pie: Maud... [sniffs] You know me so well. You really are the most thoughtful gift-giver in the world! I'm gonna love it five-ever! That's even longer than for-ever. [sighs happily]\n\nIt's the Pie Sisters' Swap Day Sooooooong!\n\nRarity: You're right, that is impressive. But it's no fissure in the sidewalk.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] [to Boulder] Play nice.\nRarity: Oh, I'm so relieved to see that you like the pouch. Especially considering what Pinkie Pie had to give up for it. [gasps] Oh!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] What?\nRarity: I mean... forget I said that! I'm, I-I-I'm glad to see that you like the pouch. You can remember that part. Just forget the second part. You know, the second part where I said that Pinkie Pie had to give something up\u2014 [shrieks] Perhaps I should just stop talking now. Nothing!\nPinkie Pie: Hee-hee, yay! I love my sister and my new confetti!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Why isn't she using her party cannon?\nRarity: Gahhhh...\n[dirt dragging noises]\nRarity: [deliberately] Ooh! Wow, look how filthy my hooves are! I really should go wash them!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Where's her cannon?\nRarity: No, no, stop, stop giving me that look! I can't take it! Nnnnn... [quickly] Pinkie Pie feels bad that the gifts that she always gives you are never as good as the ones that you give her!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] What?\nRarity: That's why she was willing to give up the party cannon for the pouch!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] She gave up her party cannon?\nPinkie Pie: [blows confetti]\nRarity: Pinkie Pie! You might want to come over here for a second!\nPinkie Pie: I think I know what this is about. You guys wanna ride the swans. Well, there are swan boats, but there are real swans here we can ri\u2014\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] You gave away your party cannon?\nRarity: [inhales] She broke me.\nPinkie Pie: Nnngh, it's just... It's just... It's just... You always give better gifts than me! That's why I had to get you the perfect gift! [beat] Are your hooves dirty? Where're you going?!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] To get your cannon back.\n\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] There.\nPinkie Pie: Yep! That sure is the pony I got the pouch from!\nRarity: That's amazing! How did you know where he'd be?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Maud Sense.\nPinkie Pie: Runs in the family!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I'd like to return this pouch for my sister's party cannon, please.\n\"Street Rat\": Sorry, missy, all sales are final.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] [slightly more forcefully] I'd like to return this pouch for my sister's party cannon, please.\nRarity: Ooh, I've never seen her like this! Look at the fire in her eyes! You'd better do what she says!\n\"Street Rat\": Fire in her eyes?\nRarity: Oh! Did she just clench her jaw?! I think she clenched her jaw!\n\"Street Rat\": I didn't see.\nRarity: Oh, no! When she clenches her jaw... you know what that means?!\n\"Street Rat\": What? What's it mean?\nRarity: Trust me, you do not want to know!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I'd like to return this pouch.\n\"Street Rat\": [whimpering] Here! Take it, take it, please! Just relax that jaw of yours and turn down that fire in your eyes! [whimpering]\n\n[skidding]\nPinkie Pie: Maud! I'm so happy you got me my party cannon back! Yay!\n[party cannon fires]\nPinkie Pie: Uh-oh. I just realized something. 'Cause you gave back the pouch for my cannon, this is now the second gift you've gotten me today! And it's something I really, really wanted! You did it again! Your gifts are always better than mine! Next year, I'm gonna have to really step it up and\u2014\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Pinkie, gift giving isn't a competition. It's an expression of love, and you always make sure to give your gifts with lots of love. That's why I'll always love them, and you, five-ever. That's even longer than for-ever.\nPinkie Pie: Awwww! [to Rarity] There you are! You've sure been washing your hooves for a long time! We've got a train to catch here!\nRarity: I know, but there is one more sight you two simply must see before we leave.\n\nRarity: Voila! Welcome to the future home of \"Rarity For You\"! What do you think of the place? Is this the right location? Did I pick a good spot?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] No. You picked the perfect spot.\nPinkie Pie: You know, I think this might be my favorite PSSSD ever! But I can't wait 'til next year's PSSS-D-W-R!\nRarity: Wait. PSSS-D-W-R? What's that?\nPinkie Pie: P-S-S-S-D-W-R! It's a new tradition that Maud and I came up with! Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day...\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] With Rarity.\nRarity: Oh! Ohhh! Why, that's the sweetest... Oh, no. Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no. I know how good you two are at giving gifts! I'm going to have to get you both something amazing, and I only have a year to do it!\nPinkie Pie: Oh, Rarity! It doesn't matter what you get us! As long as you give your gift with love, it'll be perfect!\nRarity: [sighs] Why, thank you, Pinkie.\nPinkie Pie: Buuuut now that you mention it... I could use more confetti for my party cannon. You wouldn't believe how much of that stuff I go through in a day!\n[party cannon fires]\n\n[flute music over credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[banging]\nApple Bloom: Hear ye, hear ye! The first post-cutie mark meetin' of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session!\n[long pause]\nApple Bloom: [clears throat]\nSweetie Belle: Oh! I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. I was distracted by the radiance of my cutie mark... Did you say something?\nScootaloo: I mean... it's pretty amazing how the colors just pop off your flank. It's kinda hard to look aw\u2014\n[thump]\nApple Bloom: Look, I know our cutie marks are amazing, but is that all we're gonna do now? Just spend our days starin' down at our own flanks?\nSweetie Belle: [sighs] I guess not.\nScootaloo: Yeah, I suppose that could get real boring...\nApple Bloom: [wistfully] Yeah... [beat] This is ridiculous! We need to go out and do somethin'!\nSweetie Belle: Wow, you're right!\nScootaloo: Yeah, we need to go try new stuff like we used to!\nApple Bloom: Exactly.\nSweetie Belle: Like square dancing!\n[square dancing music]\nScootaloo: Or mountain climbing! [stock yodel]\nApple Bloom: Or square dancin' on the mountain we just climbed! [same yodel over square dancing music]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Yeah!\nApple Bloom: And the more things we try, the more chances we'll have to finally get our cutie marks! Come on!\nSweetie Belle: Um... Apple Bloom?\n\n[theme song]\n\nApple Bloom: Wow... Did we really only ever do things just to get our cutie marks?\nSweetie Belle: I don't know. Maybe?\nScootaloo: Aw, come on! We did lots of stuff that didn't have anything to do with getting a cutie mark.\nSweetie Belle: Of course we did!\nApple Bloom: Absolutely!\n[montage music]\nSweetie Belle: Huh. So now that we don't have to do stuff to get our cutie marks, what is it that the Cutie Mark Crusaders actually do?\nApple Bloom: We do exactly what we got our cutie marks in!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Helping other ponies!\nScootaloo: Ponies without cutie marks!\nSweetie Belle: Or ponies who've forgotten their special purpose!\nApple Bloom: Exactly! We just have to find ponies who need our help! Come on!\n\nSweetie Belle: But are you sure you feel content?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nScootaloo: Not even a tinge of dissatisfaction?\nBig McIntosh: Nnnope.\nApple Bloom: Not even the slightest naggin' sensation that you don't really know what your purpose is in life or why you have a big apple as a cutie mark?\n[thump]\nBig McIntosh: [grunts] [spits] [annoyed] Nnnope.\n\nApple Bloom: The important thing to remember is that there is no rush.\nScootaloo: The three of us tried for the longest time, but it just comes when it comes!\nSweetie Belle: And it's totally normal to feel confused and maybe even a little lost. But being a blank flank is nothing to be ashamed of.\nScootaloo: So if you're having even the slightest problem...\nSweetie Belle: ...or concerns or questions...\nApple Bloom: ...we want you to know that we are here to help.\nMrs. Cake: I... don't think they're too worried about it yet.\nPound Cake and Pumpkin Cake: [babbling]\n\n[montage music]\n\n[scrolls unrolling]\n[door opens]\n[door shuts]\n\n[bits jingling]\n\n[bubblegum popping]\n\nApple Bloom: This is gonna be a lot harder than I thought.\nSweetie Belle: Who knew there were so few ponies worried about their cutie marks?\nScootaloo: Kinda makes you wonder why we made such a big deal out of it for so long.\n[beat]\nScootaloo: What?\nApple Bloom: The point is, helpin' ponies with cutie mark problems is what makes us special.\nSweetie Belle: But if we can't find anypony with a problem...\nScootaloo: ...Maybe we're not special.\nBulk Biceps: Yeah! I know exactly what you mean. You can't find a cutie mark problem. I have a cutie mark problem. It's so confusing, and I feel like the solution is staring me right in the muzzle.\n[beat]\nBulk Biceps: What?\n\nBulk Biceps: I see why you guys hang out here! It's cozy!\nScootaloo: [straining] The Crusader Clubhouse is a safe place, Mr... um... Bulk.\nSweetie Belle: A place where we faced all kinds of cutie mark problems!\nApple Bloom: A place where we'll go on to solve even more! Startin' with yours!\nScootaloo: No matter how long it takes!\nSweetie Belle: Or how hard it is!\nApple Bloom: We'll solve it because that's what we do!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Yeah! [straining]\nBulk Biceps: Yeah!\nSweetie Belle: So... what's your cutie mark problem?\nBulk Biceps: Oh, right. Uh, well, my cutie mark is a dumbbell, but I've lifted every dumbbell in Ponyville!\nScootaloo: [nervously] Have you tried lifting other things?\nBulk Biceps: You mean, not dumbbells?\nSweetie Belle: Yeah!\nApple Bloom: Yeah!\nBulk Biceps: Yeah!\n[crunch]\nBulk Biceps: Oof! I mean... no. I hadn't thought of that. You guys are awesome!\n[crunch]\nBulk Biceps: But... what happens when I run out of other stuff?\nSweetie Belle: ...I guess you could teach other ponies to lift things?\nApple Bloom: Yeah!\nScootaloo: Yeah!\nBulk Biceps: Yeah! Wow, you three really have a knack for this!\nSweetie Belle: That was easy!\nApple Bloom: Maybe too easy.\nScootaloo: What do you mean?\nApple Bloom: Well, it's lookin' like cutie mark problems are few and far between.\nSweetie Belle: And...?\nApple Bloom: And what if we never find another one?\nScootaloo: Well...\nApple Bloom: And even if we do, we could solve it so quick, it'll be like it never happened in the first place!\nSweetie Belle: So...?\nApple Bloom: So... then the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't have any reason to exist!\n\nSweetie Belle: The problem boils down to this \u2013 we don't need to go out and do things anymore to get our cutie marks.\nApple Bloom: Right! And\u2014\nScootaloo: Ponies with cutie mark problems are hard to find.\nApple Bloom: Exactly. But even when we find problems, we're so good at solvin' them that most of the time there's nothin' for the Cutie Mark Crusaders to do. So...\n[map unfurling]\nApple Bloom: I thought we should start figurin' out ways to search all of Equestria for cutie mark problems!\nScootaloo: That kinda seems like a lot.\nSweetie Belle: I don't think Rarity would let me travel to the far reaches of Equestria looking for cutie mark problems.\nScootaloo: Yeah, I'm sure we'll come across them in Ponyville. And when we do, we'll totally solve them because we are so awesome at it!\nScootaloo and Sweetie Belle: Hoof!\nApple Bloom: But... what do we do until then?\nSweetie Belle: Maybe whatever we want?\nApple Bloom: What do you mean?\nSweetie Belle: Well, we used to only do stuff to get our cutie marks or fulfill our destiny, but now we don't have to.\nApple Bloom: So... we can do things just for fun? Are you girls thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?!\nScootaloo and Sweetie Belle: Sure am!\n\n\n\n\nApple Bloom:\nMakin' potions!\n\n\nScootaloo:\nScootering!\n\n\nSweetie Belle:\nSinging!\n\n\nApple Bloom:\nMakin' potions!\n\nScootaloo:\nScootering!\n\nSweetie Belle:\nSinging!\n\nScootaloo: Just remember \u2013 stomp, kick, and roll! After this, you two are gonna love scootering as much as me!\nApple Bloom: If you say so.\nScootaloo: Ready? Stomp, kick, and roll! Whooo!\n[tires screeching]\nScootaloo: Ta-da!\n[thump]\n[thump]\nApple Bloom: [nervous laugh] I don't think I did it right.\n\nSweetie Belle: [blows pitch pipe] Do... Mi... So...

Who'd've thought it'd be so hard to find somethin' for us all to do together?\nScootaloo: Well, I know this might sound crazy, but what if we didn't?\nApple Bloom: Didn't what?\nScootaloo: Do things together. Well, do everything together.\nApple Bloom: But we're the Cutie Mark Crusaders!\nScootaloo: And we always will be! But I really wanna bungee jump! The speed, the height, the fall!\nSweetie Belle: And I know you two aren't interested, but I wanna try crochet.\nScootaloo: Isn't there something you've always wanted to do on your own?\nApple Bloom: I don't know... I guess I figured we'd always do stuff together. But bungee jumping sounds just as scary as crochet sounds borin'.\nScootaloo: That's okay. Sweetie Belle and I can do the things we like, and you can do whatever you like!\nSweetie Belle: Just as soon as you figure out what it is.\nApple Bloom: I guess...\nScootaloo: Great! Then we can meet back here and talk all about what we've done!\nApple Bloom: But I don't know what it'll be.\nSweetie Belle: You'll find something!\nScootaloo: Something awesome!\nApple Bloom: [sighs] Well...

We have a recital at town hall tonight, and a spot just opened up! [hushed] Tender Taps is a little too shy to perform. But if you're ready to step into a partnered routine...\nApple Bloom: That sounds an awful lot like friendship! And I'm ready for anything I don't have to do by myself!\nHoofer Steps: Well then!

I feel like that went pretty good, but let's give it one more whirl, because it's important that I do a good job partnering with my new group of friends.\nHoofer Steps: Eh... Now I'm think of it, you might be better as soloist.\n\nI guess as time goes by\nEverypony has to go out on their own\nAnd maybe someday I'll have to try\nSomethin' new that's just for me\nA little somethin' that could be\nJust my own and I won't feel so left behind\n\nHoofer Steps: Uh, partnering is a little advanced for you. But there's still lots you can do on your own.\nApple Bloom: I'm sorry, but doin' stuff on my own is exactly what I don't want.\n[door opens]\nTender Taps: Sorry it didn't work out.\nApple Bloom: Tryin' different things with my friends is always fun, even when we were terrible. Now it's just terrible.\nTender Taps: You weren't that bad. You just need to learn a few things on your own. Being a soloist can be fun! [tap dancing] Ha. Haha! You just have to do it with feeling!\n[beat]\nApple Bloom: [sighs] Thanks, but... without my friends, I don't think I'll ever feel again. Good luck at the recital.\nTender Taps: Oh, I'm not gonna do that. I mean, I want to. It's kind of all I think about. I bet some day my cutie mark will even be about performing! But I could never dance in front of an audience the way I do in class. That's t-t-t-t-terrifying!\nApple Bloom: [deadpan] Yeah, okay. Nice meetin' you.\nTender Taps: You, too. [tap dancing]\n\nScootaloo: Sweetie Belle! You are not gonna believe this, but I think I like bungee jumping even more than scootering!\nSweetie Belle: Seriously?! That's amazing! Look what I did!\nScootaloo: Wow, uh, that's, um...\nSweetie Belle: Horrible! But it was so much fun! Rarity showed me how, even though she says [imitating Rarity] \"Crochet is knitting's poorer cousin\", [normal] but I loved it!\nScootaloo: Awesome!\n[door creaks open]\nApple Bloom: Oh, hello, girls. Have fun pursuing your own interests?\nScootaloo: Apple Bloom? What are you doing sitting in the dark?\nSweetie Belle: Yeah, we thought you'd be out looking for things you like to do.\nApple Bloom: [laughs] I did. I looked all over town. I looked... and I looked... and I looked... and you know what I found? Nothin'!\n[blind snaps up]\nScootaloo: You tried every one of these?\nApple Bloom: And each one just made me feel more alone than the next! I don't see how I'm supposed to be happy that we're not hanging out anymore!\nScootaloo: Wait, I never said that. I just said we don't have to do everything together.\nSweetie Belle: Like when there's something one of us wants to do that the others don't.\nApple Bloom: Oh. [beat] Well, I guess that changes things.\nScootaloo: I can't believe you thought we didn't want to hang out anymore.\nSweetie Belle: I can't believe you tried all this stuff and didn't find one thing you liked!\nApple Bloom: Well, I kind of liked dancin', mainly because it looked like somethin' you couldn't do alone, but... I wasn't very good at it.\nSweetie Belle: Well, you don't have to be good at something to have fun!\nScootaloo: And being good doesn't always mean you will.\nApple Bloom: I know... I met the best dancer in the world, but he was so shy, he couldn't bring himself to perform, even though he really, really wanted to.\nSweetie Belle: I don't suppose this dancing pony had a cutie mark, did he?\n\n[door opens]\nApple Bloom: You're here!\nShoeshine: Shhhh!\n[audience cheering]\n[door opens]\nTender Taps: What are you doing here?\nApple Bloom: You told me that you wanted to perform more than anythin', but I was too caught up in myself to listen. You're the best dancer I've ever seen, and I'm here to convince you to get out on that stage!\n[piano playing]\nTender Taps: Um, didn't I also tell you that dancing in front of other ponies is t-t-terrifying?! I don't know if you noticed, but that auditorium is full of other ponies! I can't go out there! What if I'm bad?!\nApple Bloom: We can go on together! No matter what, you'll look good dancin' next to me.\n[audience cheering]\nTender Taps: [sighs] All right, I'll do it. But I don't have my costume, and the backdrop is all wrong, and we don't have time to change it!\nApple Bloom: Leave everything to us.\n\nTender Taps: [nervously] I don't know about this...\nSweetie Belle: Don't worry, you'll be just fine!\n[piano stops playing]\nApple Bloom: Here goes nothin'...\n[clunking]\n[audience member coughs]\nTender Taps: [gulps]\n[jazz-type music starts]\nApple Bloom: [clunky tap dancing]\n[thump]\n[audience laughing]\nApple Bloom: Can't be any worse than I was!\nTender Taps: [tentatively, then progressively more confident tap dancing] [heavy breathing]\n[pause, then audience cheering]\n[cutie mark zap]\n\nTender Taps: I can't believe it!

[short tap-dancing burst]\nApple Bloom: [taps] You know, I just might! It sure is a lot of fun, and I'm pretty confident I can only get better. [to the Crusaders] I'm sorry I was so silly about us all doin' our own things. If we hadn't, I might never even have tried dancin'!\nTender Taps: Or find out I needed help!\nSweetie Belle: With each of us going out and trying things on our own, we'll be three times as likely to find ponies to help!\nScootaloo: And trying new stuff might even make us better at helping them, like how I used my bungee jumping to change the sets!\nSweetie Belle: Or my crochet to make the costumes!\nApple Bloom: Well, one thing is for sure.

Torch!\nSpike: Who is that?\nGarble: It's Dragon Lord Torch, dummy.\nSpike: No, next to him.\nGarble: That's his daughter, Princess Ember. I wouldn't even look at her if I were you, unless you want Torch to eat you!\nSpike: [gulps]\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] This is fascinating! Dragons are notoriously reckless, but they do whatever the Dragon Lord says!\nDragon Lord Torch: Unfortunately, according to dragon law, it is time for me to step down. Sad, I know. [beat] Be sad!\n[dragons crying]\nDragon Lord Torch: This is why I have summoned you \u2013 to compete for the throne in the Gauntlet of Fire!\n[dragons cheering]\nDragon Lord Torch: Whomever has the strength and fortitude to retrieve this bloodstone scepter from the heart of the flame-cano will be crowned Lord of the Dragons!\n[explosion]\n[magic shimmering]\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] When the scepter disappeared, the dragons stopped glowing! We are learning so much!\nRarity: [prepares to sneeze] [sneezes]\nSpike: Uh, excuse me!\nGarble: Ugh, you even sneeze like a pony!\nDragon Lord Torch: The Gauntlet is dangerous, for I designed it myself! Only dragons with my ferocity, strength, and determination will be able to finish. We will gather at the cliff when the sun is at its peak!\n[dragons cheering]\nSpike: I don't want to be Dragon Lord or dragon toast, and I stopped glowing, so let's sneak out of here!\nDragon Lord Torch: Ah! Where do you think you're going, little dragon?!\nSpike: Oh, uh, hi, your Lordship. Uh, I was just going home!\nDragon Lord Torch: You don't get to leave unless I say you can!\nPrincess Ember: Dad, look at him. He's just a runt. Besides, he doesn't even wanna compete. Let him go.\nDragon Lord Torch: He is rather tiny, heh-heh. I could squish him with my pinky claw. [chuckles]\nSpike: [nervous chuckle]\nDragon Lord Torch: That wasn't a joke. It was a fact. When I want you to laugh, I will say \"be amused!\"\nSpike: Of course, your Lordship! I, uh, guess I don't understand dragon customs. Another reason why I shouldn't compete.\nDragon Lord Torch: [sighs] Hm. Very well then, little dragon. I release you.\nSpike: Thank you! [to Ember] And thank you.\nDragon Lord Torch: [grunts] Where do you think you're going?\nPrincess Ember: To prepare for the Gauntlet.\nDragon Lord Torch: No, you're not. You're not much bigger than that runt I just sent home!\nPrincess Ember: But I'm smarter than most of these boulderheads and you know it!\nDragon Lord Torch: Being smart won't help you win this Gauntlet! It was designed for a big, strong dragon to win, because it takes a big, strong dragon to lead! Besides, I said no!\nPrincess Ember: [growls] I hate when he does that!\n[dragons chatting]\nMaar: Ha. When I become Dragon Lord, I will make burps an official greeting!\n\"Barry\": Ha, you? Please! When I win, I will pillage Equestria for all their pillows. Why should these ponies be comfortable while we sleep on rocks?\nGarble: That's nothing! When I'm in charge, the first thing I'll do is get revenge on those puny ponies! They'll regret they ever crossed Garble! We'll take whatever we want from Equestria and burn the rest!\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] Oh, my gosh!\nRarity: [hushed] Ooh, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I hope that burping dragon wins!\nSpike: None of them can win! Equestria's in big trouble if any of them are in charge!\nTwilight Sparkle: But what can we do?\nSpike: There's only one thing to do, and only I can do it! I have to win the Gauntlet of Fire!\nTwilight Sparkle and Rarity: Oh...\n\nRarity: What do you mean you have to win the Gauntlet?\nSpike: It's the only way to protect Equestria from the dragons. You heard them! They have horrible plans for ponies if they win! So somehow, I have to do it!\nTwilight Sparkle: There has to be another way. It's too dangerous. Besides, if you win, you'd have to stay here!\nSpike: I know, but there's no other way to keep my friends safe.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, if you're staying to compete, then we're staying to cheer you on!\n\nDragon Lord Torch: I thought I released you, tiny one!\nSpike: I decided to compete. I am a dragon, after all.\nGarble: Are you sure? You can't even fly!\n[dragons laughing]\nDragon Lord Torch: All dragons are welcome to compete, but they do so at their own peril! Flying to Flame-cano Island is the first of many challenges you will face in your quest to find the bloodstone scepter! [roars]\n[dragon commotion]\nGarble: Good luck! Just kidding. I hope you lose.\n[smack]\nSpike: [scream]\n[splash]\nSpike: [gasps] [sarcastically] Thanks, Garble! I was planning on swimming anyway!\nRarity: You can do it, Spike!\n[sea worms roaring]\n[splash]\nSpike: He's gonna drown!\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike!\n[bubbling]\nSpike: [gasps] [panting]\n\nSpike: Hey, are you okay?\nPrincess Ember: [coughing]\nSpike: [gasps] Princess Ember!\nPrincess Ember: What do you think you're doing?\nRarity: Only saving your ungrateful scales!\nPrincess Ember: Did that seaweed just talk? Ponies?! What are they doing here?!\nSpike: They're my friends!\nPrincess Ember: Friends? Dragons don't do friends.\nSpike: Well, this dragon does.\nPrincess Ember: Whatever. I don't care as long as none of you get in my way. I have a Gauntlet to win.\nSpike: But I thought your dad said that\u2014\nPrincess Ember: I don't care what my dad said! I'll show him and every dragon who thinks I'm just a little princess there are better things than being big and strong!\n[slingtail grunts]\n[thwack]\nGarble: [scream] [grunts] Don't leave me here, Spike!\nSpike: [straining]\nGarble: Ha-ha! Knew you'd do it. Your pony friends made you soft.\nSpike: Uh-huh. You're welcome.\nGarble: For what? I didn't say thank you. [sniffs] Wow, you even smell like ponies. [sniffs] Or is it coming from over there? [sniffing]\nPrincess Ember: [gruff voice] Uh, that's just me. I, uh, robbed some ponies on my way over here.\nGarble: Huh, I like your style. Have I met you before? You kind of look like\u2014\nSpike: My, uh, old neighbor! Uh, Sandy... Rockbeach!\nGarble: Stupid slingtails knocked me down! But I've wasted enough time making small talk. Get it? Ha-ha! Because you're too small to win this! I'm funny.\nPrincess Ember: Why did you cover for me? You could've had one less competitor.\nSpike: I could ask you the same thing. You could've told Garble about my friends.\n[Wilhelm scream]\n[thumps]\nPrincess Ember: Yikes... That looks rough. But that's what makes it a challenge.\nSpike: Are you kidding? Those boulders are huge! Hey, what if we worked together? You fly me up there, and I'll help look out for boulders, like a second set of eyes!\nRarity: Pssst!\n[flump]\nRarity: [hushed] Spike! Are you sure it's a good idea to team up with Ember? You don't know her too well.\nSpike: I do know she could've told Garble about you, but she didn't. I think we can trust her.\nTwilight Sparkle: Her behavior does seem contradictory to everything I've noted about dragons so far.\nPrincess Ember: Hey, you, little fella! I've thought about it, and your plan makes sense. Let's do it.\nSpike: Really? Great! It's a deal!\nPrincess Ember: Just so you know, this doesn't mean we're gonna pick flowers or exchange necklaces or whatever pony friends do.\nTwilight Sparkle: Good luck. We'll meet you at the top.\n\n[dragon commotion]\nSpike: Pull up! There's one on your tail!\nPrincess Ember: [yelps]\nSpike: Go left!\n\nSpike: So what do we do now?\nPrincess Ember: I think we go through there.\n[roar of flame]\n[dragons whimpering]\nRarity: [yelps] Oh, that looks scary! I mean, you can do it!\nPrincess Ember: Listen, Spike. I wouldn't have made it this far without you. So I guess, if you want to, we could keep working together. I mean, just until we get through that tunnel.\nSpike: Okay!\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] We'll be right behind you!\n\n[crunching]\nGarble: [straining]\n[crunch]\nGarble: [groaning]\n[various \"shing\"s]\nSpike: [gasps] Oof!\n[thud]\nGarble: Urgh!\n[shing!]\nGarble: [groaning]\n\nRarity: Oh, you made it! Oh, we were so worried!\nSpike: About us? [scoffs] That tunnel was cake! [groans]\n[thump]\nPrincess Ember: Wait. How did you two get through?\n[rumbling]\nRarity: [yelps]\nSpike: Rarity!\nRarity: [yelps] [panting] Oh, thanks, Spike!\nSpike: [sighs] It was nothing.\nPrincess Ember: Nothing? You just risked everything to save her! And they're putting themselves in danger just to support you!\nSpike: Well, that's just what friends do. Don't you have anyone who looks out for you?\nPrincess Ember: Not really. Unless I count you. [beat] Which I don't! Because we were only helping each other get through the tunnel, and now we're through the tunnel, so that's it.\nSpike: Wait, what do you mean?\nPrincess Ember: Well, there's only one winner, one scepter, and one Dragon Lord. So I guess it's every dragon for themselves.\nSpike: Oh. So we aren't really friends?\nPrincess Ember: Maybe if we were in Ponyland, but like I said, dragons don't do friendship.\n\nSpike: I can't believe Ember ditched me.\nRarity: [muffled] Oh, you're better off. She was only looking out for herself. She's just like all the other dragons.\nSpike: She's not, though. I know it. She saved me, even when she didn't have to. I don't care what she says. That makes us friends.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Is it just me, or have we seen this crevasse three times already?\nSpike: It's kinda hard to tell. They all look the same. Except for this one! Look! We made it! I can't believe I'm the only dragon to make it this far!\nGarble: You're not! And I'm not losing to a puny pony-loving dragon like you!\nRarity: [yelps] [muffled] We have to do something!\nTwilight Sparkle: [muffled] Look!\n[thump]\nGarble: [yelps]\nSpike: [screaming] Ember! I thought it was every dragon for themselves! Why did you save me?!\nPrincess Ember: That's what friends do! And I am. I mean, we are. I never should have left you back there. Agh, please don't make me talk about my feelings!\nGarble: What the?! [growls]\nPrincess Ember: Spike! Get the scepter! [grunts]\n[thump]\nGarble: [straining] Argh! Whoa!\nPrincess Ember: [straining]\n[thump]\n[ding!]\nGarble: [frustrated grunt] I'm sick and tired of you two helping each other! Dragons don't do helping!\nPrincess Ember: These dragons do! [grunts]\n[thump]\n[dragons chattering]\nSpike: [panting] Whoa...\n[ding!]\n[magic roaring]\n[explosion]\nSpike: Leave her alone!\nGarble: What? You?! You have the scepter?! But that means that you're...\nPrincess Ember: The Dragon Lord. Dragon Lord Spike.\nGarble: [groans] [reluctantly] Dragon... Lord... Spike...\nSpike: That's right! Uh... Now, go start your long journey home. And give every dragon you see on the way a hug. Don't tell them why.\nGarble: Awww! But that'll be super embarrassing!\nSpike: I command you to do it!\nGarble: [annoyed noise] I can't believe this...\nPrincess Ember: Dragon Lord Spike. Hm, has a nice ring to it.\nSpike: Dragon Lord Ember sounds a lot better.\nPrincess Ember: What? No. You're the Dragon Lord now.\nSpike: The Dragon Lord is whoever brings the scepter back to your father! Besides, you'll make a great leader. I was just doing this to protect the ponies. But I know you'll protect them just as well as I would have.\nPrincess Ember: You sure about this?\nSpike: Absolutely. My home is in Equestria with my friends.\nPrincess Ember: Well, you'll have at least one friend here too. What are you doing?\nSpike: It's called a hug!\nPrincess Ember: Oh. I don't know if I like it. But... okay.\nSpike: Mmmmm!\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] Awww!\nRarity: [giggles]\n\n[magic shimmering]\nDragon Lord Torch: Ember? You?!\nPrincess Ember: I know you didn't think I could do it, but I did.\nDragon Lord Torch: I expressly told you not to do it, because you're not\u2014!\nPrincess Ember: I'm not big and strong. I know. But you know what? I won anyway. So maybe it takes more than just being big and strong to be a good Dragon Lord!\nDragon Lord Torch: I was wrong, Ember. You might not be big, but you are strong and smart, and perhaps that counts for more than I thought. And you will make an excellent leader.\nPrincess Ember: Thanks, dad. [to dragons] Agree with him! Just kidding! That's not gonna be my thing.\nDragon Lord Torch: [laughing] Dragons, hear me! I present to you our new Dragon Lord, Ember!\n[dragons cheering]\nDragon Lord Torch: [to Garble] Hm? What is the meaning of this?!\nGarble: I can't tell you!\nPrincess Ember: [laughs]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: You did well, Spike. With Ember as Dragon Lord, the ponies will be safe and you've gained us a powerful ally.\nSpike: And a new friend!\nTwilight Sparkle: Plus, Ember said I could write to her anytime I had questions about dragon culture! With this much information, I'll be able to write a whole book on dragons!\nRarity: And I gained tons of ideas for a new line of camouflage clothing! I think I'll call it \"Camo-Maud\"!\nRarity, Twilight Sparkle and Spike: [laughing]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[wheels squeaking]\n[light thud]\nTwilight Sparkle: First lesson of the day, we very carefully set the table without using magic, so that\u2014 Yikes!\n[silverware clattering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Did you...?! How? When? What?!\nStarlight Glimmer: What?\nTwilight Sparkle: I said no magic. You were supposed to do it by hoof so I could work in a friendship lesson.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, I heard \"set the table\" and just kinda went for it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, if you hadn't used magic, you'd have heard me say, uh... this plate represents your head, this spoon is your heart, and the knives... are sharp! Always be careful with knives. [sigh] The metaphors make more sense when you're actually setting the table.\nStarlight Glimmer: Should I... change it back?\nTwilight Sparkle: I just want to make sure you're ready for this dinner. Princess Celestia will be joining us tomorrow night to see how the friendship lessons are going!\nStarlight Glimmer: If it's just you, me, and Princess Celestia, why are there four seats?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, the whole point is for you to bring a new friend. That way, the princess will see for herself just how far you've come. And how good a teacher you have.\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, I can't choose. I like all your friends.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's the best part! You have to make a new friend!\nStarlight Glimmer: New friends? Hey, maybe I'll just force friendships by magically enslaving the entire population of Ponyville!\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight!\nStarlight Glimmer: Kidding! [laughs nervously]\n\n[theme song]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Let's see. Make new friends in Ponyville, the friendliest place in Equestria. Shouldn't be hard...\nPinkie Pie: Need to make a new friend, huh? I know just the pony for you!\n\nPinkie Pie: Miss Starlight Glimmer, meet Mrs. Cake!\n[small splats]\nMrs. Cake: How are you, dearie?\nStarlight Glimmer: Are you baking? Can I help?\n[magic whirls]\nPinkie Pie: Wow, Mrs. Cake! Look what your new friend made you!\nMrs. Cake: [chuckles] New friend. I like the sound of\u2013 [gasps] Howza-wowza! A-Are you trying to put me out of business with your fancy magical-thingy-whatsit cake?!\n[splat]\nMrs. Cake: [yelps and spits]\nStarlight Glimmer: Sorry...\nPinkie Pie: [licks, swallows] In her defense, it is delicious! [chomps]\n\n[thump]\n[apples falling]\nApplejack: I think I have just the pony for you, Starlight. Meet Big Mac!\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\nApplejack: He's not much of a talker.\nBig McIntosh: Nnope.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, that's too bad. I love a good conversation.\n[magic wisps]\nBig McIntosh: [motormouth] Eeyup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-y-y-y-y-you did something! Whoa! What's happening? I feel really weird! I'm talkin' so much! And I'm so articulate! Enunciating with such precise pronunciation! Annie Apple awoke and accidentally ate an auburn azalea! [screams] Make it stop!\nApplejack: [growls]\nStarlight Glimmer: I can't be friends with somepony who doesn't talk.\nApplejack: [growls]\nStarlight Glimmer: ...And I guess my first instinct shouldn't be to magically command ponies to act the way I want them to?\nApplejack: [growls]\nStarlight Glimmer: Alright, I'll change him back!\n\nRarity: The trick to finding a new friend is to render yourself radiant. First impressions count a great deal, you know.\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm glad you all got past my first impression.\nRarity: Well, everypony deserves a second chance. Ooh! Now, I have a top-notch idea. I'm thinking pastel silk here and here with a crinoline underneath.\nStarlight Glimmer: You really think a new outfit will help me meet ponies?\nRarity: Oh, with the right outfit, you can do anything, darling!\nStarlight Glimmer: When will it be ready?\nRarity: Three weeks.\nStarlight Glimmer: Dinner's tomorrow.\nRarity: Well then, how about a hat from the... [clears throat] ...clearance bin?\n[fabric ripping]\nStarlight Glimmer: Ugh! Maybe not.\n\nRainbow Dash: Heh. Nopony's gonna make friends with you because of your outfit. The only thing you want a new friend draped in is coolness.\nStarlight Glimmer: Like you?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, but you already know me, so... [gasps] [spitting] Spitfire! Heh. Sorry.\nStarlight Glimmer: Who's that?\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] Only the Wonderbolt-iest pony in the Wonderbolts! Come on, I'll introduce you!\n[sonic boom]\nRainbow Dash: You coming or what?\nStarlight Glimmer: I guess my first question would be, \"What's a Wonderbolt?\"\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] You've never heard of the Wonderbolts?! Where have you been?!\nStarlight Glimmer: [nervously] Enslaving villages, I guess...\nRainbow Dash: Right.\n\nAngel: [giggling]\nStarlight Glimmer: You're adorable, but probably not what Twilight had in mind.\nFluttershy: [sighs]\n\n[ponies chattering]\nStarlight Glimmer: [groan] What is going on? This is Ponyville! If I can't make a friend here, there's gotta be something wrong with me! [sighs] Okay, calm down. Nobody makes friends with a total stresscase.\n[more ponies chattering]\nStarlight Glimmer: [to herself] Stop stressing... Stop stressing!\n[long beat]\n[door opens and shuts]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] This is just what I needed.\nTrixie: [sighs] Tell me about it.\nStarlight Glimmer: You ever have one of those days?\nTrixie: For me, they're all one of those days.\nStarlight Glimmer: [giggles]\nTrixie: I'm gonna start coming here every time I visit Ponyville.\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm not from here either. I've been trying to make friends, but it's not easy. They're not saying it, but I think everypony knows about my past. I may have been a tiny bit... completely and utterly evil?\nTrixie: Ponies judge me on my past too.\nStarlight Glimmer: Finally, a pony I can relate to.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Soup spoon, salad fork, pasta spoon, strawberry pick. I'm beginning to think that after friendship, the greatest magic of all is proper silverware placement! [giggles]\nStarlight Glimmer: Twilight, guess what? I made a new friend!\nTwilight Sparkle: That's fantastic news!\nStarlight Glimmer: She's great!\nTwilight Sparkle: Great!\nStarlight Glimmer: She's powerful!\nTwilight Sparkle: Powerful?\nStarlight Glimmer: She's\u2014\nTrixie: Hello... princess!\nTwilight Sparkle: Trixie?!\n\nStarlight Glimmer: You know each other?\nTwilight Sparkle: You could say that.\nTrixie: We've had our differences. What matters is Twilight gave me a second chance, and I appreciate it.\n[pause]\nTwilight Sparkle: So, um, what brings you to Ponyville?\nTrixie: The Grrrreat and Powerful Trrrrixie has come to perform a new stage show of grand illusion! I am calling it \"The Humble and Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour\"!\nStarlight Glimmer: [hushed] That's kind of a mouthful.\nTrixie: [hushed] It's a working title.\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight? A moment? Over here? [hushed] I know I said make friends with anypony, but, well, with Trixie's past, and your past, I'm not sure she's the best... first friend.\nStarlight Glimmer: But whatever she did, you've forgiven her, right?\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course. It's just... She wasn't the nicest pony.\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, you did say anypony, and I just assumed that you'd trust me to make my own friends the way Princess Celestia trusted you.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] You're right. I trust you. Just be back in time for the dinner.\nStarlight Glimmer: Thanks, Twilight! You won't regret it!\nTwilight Sparkle: I hope not. [sighs]\n\nTrixie: This magic show's gonna be the greatest thing Ponyville's ever seen!\nCherry Berry and Goldengrape: [unintelligible whispering] ...did you see...?\nCaramel, Shoeshine, and Sunshower Raindrops: [unintelligible whispering] ...did you hear...?\nTrixie: Everypony always says they'll give you a second chance, but deep down, they never forget.\nStarlight Glimmer: That's what I'm worried about.\nTrixie: [sighs]\nStarlight Glimmer: What is it?\nTrixie: I heard what Twilight said about me, and she's right. I wasn't very nice. So I'd understand if you didn't want to be friends.\nStarlight Glimmer: Are you kidding? You're the first pony I've met who has any idea how I feel!\nTrixie: Can you keep a secret?\nStarlight Glimmer: What are friends for?\nTrixie: [hushed] The things I've done? I did them because I was jealous of Twilight. She's just the best at everything, and I wanted to beat her at something!\nStarlight Glimmer: [hushed] Your secret's safe with me.\nTrixie: Thanks. Want to help me unpack my wagon?\n\nTrixie: I spend a lot of time on the road with my wagon, so it might be a tad messy.\nStarlight Glimmer: Maybe I can help. I'm pretty good at organizing stuff. Magic props, brainwashed crowds...\nStarlight Glimmer and Trixie: [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pssssssst! Pssst! Psssssst! Shhhhhh!\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, I'll catch up. I think there's something in my hoof.\nTrixie: Sure. The wagon's right around the corner.\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] So, how's it going with your new friend?\nStarlight Glimmer: [sarcastically] Great. Thanks for asking in a completely not creepy way.\nTwilight Sparkle: Because you know, if it isn't working out for any reason, I could introduce you to my friend here.\n[bush rustling]\nStarlight Glimmer: [deadpan] Nice to meet you.\nTwilight Sparkle: No, no! You can come out now!\n[dubstep playing]\nTwilight Sparkle: You like music, right? DJ Pon-3'd be the perfect friend for tonight's incredibly important dinner with Celestia. You know, if you decide to make a last-minute change. Heh.\nStarlight Glimmer: So back at your castle when you said \"I trust you\", you meant \"I don't trust you\".\nTwilight Sparkle: [nervously] Who can really say who said what? I know I can't! [to DJ Pon-3] Can you?\n[dubstep fades out]\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight, I'm just trying to look out for you.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] I appreciate it, but you're wrong about Trixie. She's just like me. We have a real connection.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's kind of what I'm afraid of. Oh! What about her?\n[thump]\nStarlight Glimmer: Please, Twilight! I know you're trying to help, but I need to make friends on my own if I'm going to become a better pony.\nTwilight Sparkle: But do you really think Trixie's the one to help you with that?\nStarlight Glimmer: Wow. Trixie was right. You're not really giving her a second chance. I wonder what that says about how you feel about me.\nCranky Doodle Donkey: [snorts]\n[bird flapping]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh! Now he'd be perfect!\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans]\n\n[thump]\n[dragging]\nStarlight Glimmer: I was thinking. You said Twilight is better than you at everything, but that's not true. You're better at magic.\nTrixie: Only when I'm wearing a soul-sucking evil amulet, so I don't think that counts. Funny story. Don't need to get into it.\nStarlight Glimmer: I meant stage magic.\nTrixie: Well, of course! Great? Yes. Powerful? Obviously. But I'm not the best. As great and powerful as I am, there's one trick I've never been able to do \u2013 the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive!\n[silent film-type piano music and film reel flickering]\nTrixie: [narrating] Only one magician has ever pulled it off \u2013 my hero, Hoofdini! You are supposed to blast yourself into the open mouth of a hungry manticore! After the manticore chews you up and swallows you, you magically step out of a box on the other side of the stage!\n[film reel runs out]\nTrixie: Completely unharmed!\nStarlight Glimmer: That sounds very...\nTrixie: Dangerous?\nStarlight Glimmer: I was gonna say cool!\nTrixie: I knew I liked you for a reason. I don't know how he did it! If I tried it, I'd get chewed up and swallowed by that manticore.\nStarlight Glimmer: Not if you could use real magic.\nTrixie: Obviously. Way to rub it in.\nStarlight Glimmer: No, I mean, I could help! You could start the trick, and right before you got chewed up, I could use magic to save you...\n[magic zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: ...and make you appear in the black box!\nTrixie: I guess that would work... But if you made one mistake, I'd be a goner.\nStarlight Glimmer: Hah. When it comes to magic, I don't make mistakes. Maybe I could be your... magic show helper pony!\nTrixie: We call it \"assistant\" in the magician biz. And... nopony's ever offered to help before.\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, I'd be honored.\nTrixie: You may have just made my great and powerful magic show even better! Which I didn't think was possible! We're gonna blow them away tonight!\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans] I can't! Tonight's this incredibly important dinner with Twilight.\nTrixie: Oh.\nStarlight Glimmer: Can I vent for a minute?\nTrixie: What are friends for?\nStarlight Glimmer: Even after Twilight says she trusts me, she clearly doesn't trust me enough to choose my own friends. [sighs] I guess you were right. No second chances.\nTrixie: Hmph, I wish I could say I was surprised. Well, lucky for Princess Twilight, I have my magic show tonight. If you have to go to the dinner, I completely understand. [dramatically] I just hope I find a way to survive the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive without my new assistant!\n\n[ice sculpture dripping]\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight Glimmer should be here, heh, any minute, heh. Any minute now... [nervous laugh] [forced] How about I introduce everyone? Our friendship lessons are going so well! She made three new friends! She has such great taste in friends. I don't know where she would've learned that! [nervous laugh]\nCranky Doodle Donkey: Starlight Glimmer? I thought you said \"nosehair trimmers\"! What's going on? I'm hungry! And my nose is too hairy. [snorts]\nTwilight Sparkle: [nervously] Ha-ha, Cranky Doodle! You're so funny! If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna check the kitchen. Maybe she got lost amongst the, uh... artichokes! [nervous laugh]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight? Has anyone seen Starlight Glimmer? I'm looking for her! Trixie.\n\nPinkie Pie: So this is the Humble and Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour?\nApplejack: Ain't that a mouthful of molasses.\nTrixie: It's a working title! Oh, this is gonna be the greatest night of my life! Excuse me. Our lives.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] I'm so glad we're not at that boring dinner.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ahem? You just decided to skip our dinner without telling me? Are you aware that, at this very moment, Princess Celestia is waiting for you at a table with exquisite silverware placement?!\nStarlight Glimmer: Yes, but\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: This is exactly why I didn't want you to make friends with Trixie.\nTrixie: A-ha! You still don't trust me! But guess what, princess? It doesn't matter if you want to give me a second chance or not. Starlight had to choose between you and me, and she chose me! Your pupil chose me, so ha! I win!\nStarlight Glimmer: You win? That sounds like you just made friends with me to beat Twilight.\nTrixie: Exactly! [beat] Wait! I mean, no! I got caught up in the moment. I like you. Beating Twilight is just a bonus. [gasps] Saying that didn't help, did it?\nStarlight Glimmer: I should've known. Nopony else in Ponyville wanted to be my friend. Why would you? [controlled sobbing]\nTrixie: Wait, it's not like that! I am your friend. [groans]\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, you won. I hope you're happy!\nTrixie: [sighs] Looks like the Great and Powerful Trixie is back to a solo show.\nTwilight Sparkle: Trixie?\nTrixie: ...Which is exactly the way she likes it! Thank you, Princess Twilight, for getting rid of that annoying pony who wanted to be my first friend! I am not sad at all! I definitely don't feel as if my heart is breaking into a million pieces!\n\n[spotlight clanks]\nTrixie: [unenthusiastic] Come one, come all. Come and see the Pathetic and Friendless Trixie's \"Way-To-Go-Dum-Dum-You-Really-Messed-It-Up-This-Time Repentance Tour\".\n[crowd confused]\nTrixie: It's a working title! [unenthusiastic] Behold, your fears come true. A pony-eating manticore.\n[manticore roars]\nFluttershy: [trembling]\nTrixie: [unenthusiastic] For tonight, the Great and Powerful Trixie will be performing the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive.\n[crowd gasps]\nTrixie: [unenthusiastic] Now, now, save your gasps for when I defy the beast's jaws of doom and appear inside that black box. [dramatically] I was supposed to perform this trick with my great and powerful assistant, who was also my great and powerful friend!\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight, when I first came to Ponyville, Princess Celestia gave me room to make my own decisions and my own friends. I need to give you the same freedom. I shouldn't have tried to pick and choose your friends for you. Just like me, you have to make your own decisions and your own friends.\nStarlight Glimmer: But... what if Trixie really was using me just to one-up you?\nTwilight Sparkle: From what I've seen, she's the real thing.\n[fuse lights]\nTwilight Sparkle: But it's not my place to judge. It's all up to you.\n[manticore roars]\n[fuse hisses]\nTrixie: Starlight? If you're out there and you still want to be friends, let's be great and powerful together! [slightly echoing] Please?\n[cannon fires]\n[manticore roars]\nTrixie: [shrieks]\n[manticore swallows and belches]\n[crowd gasps]\nFluttershy: [faints]\n[crowd confused]\n[magic zap]\n[crunch]\nTrixie: [woozy] Behold, the Peat and Growerful Triskie...!\n[thud]\n[beat]\n[crowd cheers]\nTrixie: [amplified] And now, I'm proud to introduce my great and powerful assistant! [normal] And best friend. [amplified] Starlight Glimmer!\n[crowd cheers]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Trixie!\nTrixie: What do you want?\nTwilight Sparkle: I was wrong. I'm sorry. And I have to hand it to you. I could never have pulled off a trick like that.\nTrixie: Thank you, princess.\n[fireworks launch]\n\n[ice sculpture dripping]\nCranky Doodle Donkey: How do you get your hair to do that all the time?\nPrincess Celestia: [sighs]\n\n[silent film-type piano music over credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nScootaloo: Hey! Rainbow Dash!\nRainbow Dash: Hiya, Scootaloo! What's up?\nScootaloo: The Rainbow Dash Fan Club just decided \u2013 everypony's coming to see you when the Wonderbolts' new tour comes through Ponyville!\nRainbow Dash: Well, it's great that you guys are going to the show, Scoot, but I won't actually be performing in it. Reservists aren't in the show unless one of the real Wonderbolts can't fly. [chuckles] I'll probably be working crowd control or something.\nScootaloo: You're still gonna be wearing a Wonderbolts uniform though, right?\nRainbow Dash: A Reservist one, yeah.\nScootaloo: Hmm. That's good enough for me.\n[engines roaring]\n[boom]\nRainbow Dash: [gasps]\nScootaloo: Whoa!\nSpitfire: Rainbow Dash! Glad we found you. We need you in the show when we get to Ponyville. Flying.\nScootaloo: But she's only in the Reserves!\nSpitfire: Not anymore, kid.\nRainbow Dash: [slow gasp] You mean...\nScootaloo: [gasps] Rainbow Dash! You're finally a full-fledged Wonderbolt! Woo-hoo! [laughs] Yeah, Rainbow Dash! Whoo!\nSpitfire: Heh. What she said.\n\n[theme song]\n\n[zooming]\nRainbow Dash: Uh, anypony seen my wing balm? I don't want to be stiff when I show up at Wonderbolt headquarters.\nSpike: Got it!\n[thump]\n[click]\nTwilight Sparkle: Do you have time to tell us what happened, Rainbow Dash?\nRarity: Oh, yes, we must know every detail!\n[thump]\nPinkie Pie: Start from when you were a foal and you first knew your destiny was to become a Wonderbolt!\nRainbow Dash: Heh. Well, not much to tell, really. Spitfire told me the Wonderbolts need me to go on tour with them.\nFluttershy: That's really great. I know how long you've been waiting for a spot to open up.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah. Fire Streak decided to retire and teach full-time. Cloudsdale Flight School will probably be churning out Wonderbolts with him there. But guess who was at the top of the Reserve list.\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, ooh, I know! Pick me!\nRarity: So what do you do now, Dashie?\nRainbow Dash: I have to report to Wonderbolts headquarters this afternoon. It's only two days 'til tour starts, and I need to learn the routine.\n[door opens]\nPinkie Pie: You're leaving already?! [gasps] But we barely started your congratulation party! I haven't even thought about your going-away party yet!\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie, I'm not leaving Ponyville. I just have to train for this show.\nFluttershy: I hope everything goes well. Sounds like an awful lot of pressure having to learn everything so quickly.\nApplejack: Yeah. Good luck, Dash.\nRainbow Dash: Luck? Heh. Save that for the rest of the team.\n[snap]\nRainbow Dash: Now that my awesomeness has finally been recognized, the other Wonderbolts will have to keep up or eat my cloud trail!\nTwilight Sparkle: Everypony knows you're a great flyer, Rainbow Dash, but so are the rest of the Wonderbolts. It might be more challenging than you think.\nRainbow Dash: Aw, you're right! I mean, do I show up wearing sunglasses or not? Sunglasses are automatically cool, but anypony can put them on. Maybe I'd stand out more if I didn't.\n\n[engines roaring]\nSpitfire: Team briefings are every morning at\u2014\nRainbow Dash: 0720, because there were twenty ponies in the original E.U.P. Guard that became the Wonderbolts!\nSpitfire: Right. And I know you've seen the academy bunks, but these are the official Wonderbolts barracks.\nRainbow Dash: Built by Admiral Fairweather himself!\n[thud]\nSpitfire: Don't forget rule number one, newbie. Always check both ways before crossing the runway.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, sure, but... nopony else is here.\nSpitfire: They will be, and most of the Wonderbolts like to make a flashy entrance, so stay alert.\nRainbow Dash: Right, no problem!\n\nRainbow Dash: Whoa! Is that General Flash's cap?!\nSpitfire: And the original crest with the Wonderbolts motto on it.\nRainbow Dash and Spitfire: \"Altius volantis! Soaring higher!\"\nRainbow Dash: Wow! [gasps] I mean, ha, cool.\nSpitfire: Okay, newbie, we've got a show in two days, which means you gotta hustle your haunches to learn this routine. You got five minutes to get dressed and get outside to meet the rest of the team.\nRainbow Dash: Yes, ma'am! I'll have all of the moves down by the end of the day!\nSpitfire: Let's hope so. We're all expecting you to make quite an impression.\n[zoom]\n\nRainbow Dash: Lookin' good! Okay, you're about to take your first flight as an actual Wonderbolt. [sighs] No pressure. [stretching groan] Just gotta go out there and knock 'em off their hooves. Okay, Wonderbolts, get ready to meet your most awesome member ever!\n\n[Wonderbolts chattering]\n[engines roaring]\nSpitfire: Hey, look out!\nRainbow Dash: Huh? Whooaaa!\n[crash, clatter]\nRainbow Dash: [unsteady groan]\n[Wonderbolts laughing]\nMisty Fly: Whoa, most awesome entrance by a newbie ever.\nSoarin: Are you okay, Rainbow Dash?\nFleetfoot: More like Rainbow Crash.\n[Wonderbolts laughing]\n\nYoung Rainbow Dash: Okay, flight school! Get ready for Rainbow Dash! Hah\u2014whooooa!\n[thud]\nYoung Rainbow Dash: [grunts]\n[crash]\n[trash can rolling]\nYoung Hoops: More like Rainbow Crash!\n[foals laughing]\nYoung Hoops and Young Pegasi: Rainbow Crash! Rainbow Crash! Rainbow Crash! Rainbow Crash!\n\nRainbow Dash: Hey! You guys buzzed me on purpose!\nSpitfire: Not quite. You forgot rule number one, newbie.\nSurprise, Fleetfoot, High Winds, Misty Fly and Soarin: Always check both ways before crossing the runway.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, well, I was just... testing you guys!\nWonderbolts: [disbelieving laughter]\nSpitfire: Alright, nopony got hurt and we got a lot to do, so let's forget about this and get flying!\nMisty Fly: Classic rookie move, Rainbow Crash. That was amazing.\n\n[jet engines roaring]\nSpitfire: [through loudhailer] Higher, Crash! You're breaking formation!\n\nSoarin: Check your nine, Crash!\n\nSpitfire: Tighter, Crash, get in there!\nRainbow Dash: [growls] My name's not Crash!\n[thud]\nRainbow Dash and Surprise: [yelps]\nSurprise: Huh, could've fooled me.\n\n[locker door closes]\nFleetfoot: Hey, Crash, I know it was a tough day today, but don't worry. You'll get the hang of it.\nRainbow Dash: Tough day? Please. If I can pull off a sonic rainboom, I can learn this routine. I'll have it down cold tomorrow. Probably even come up with a couple of improvements.\nSpitfire: Rainbow Dash, over here!\nRainbow Dash: Yes, ma'am!\nSpitfire: I'm glad you're still here.\nRainbow Dash: Oh, yeah? Did you want some ideas on how to make the show extra-awesome?\nSpitfire: Not quite. I know you've been a Reservist for a while, but the 'Bolts have a few of their own rules you might not know about. Like worst flyer of the day has to clean up the whole compound. Better get to it, Crash.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] [under her breath] My name's not Crash.\n\n[door opens]\n[party cannon explodes]\nRest of main cast and Cutie Mark Crusaders: Surprise!\nRainbow Dash: What?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Hooray, Rainbow Dash! Our favorite Wonderbolt!\nTwilight Sparkle: We know you're probably tired, Rainbow Dash, but Pinkie wanted to throw you a real party.\nPinkie Pie: Your best day [through megaphone] ever party!\nRainbow Dash: [nervous laugh] Yeah. It was somethin', all right.\nApplejack: Well we can't wait to hear all about it!\nRainbow Dash: Heh. And I'd love to tell you, I really would, but I'm pretty beat. [yawns] You know, from all the... excitement of my big day?\nFluttershy: Um, is something wrong, Rainbow Dash?\nRainbow Dash: What could be wrong? I'm finally a Wonderbolt, which means everything has to be totally, perfectly awesome.\nRarity: Oh, no. Something is wrong. What happened, darling?\nRainbow Dash: I told you, it's nothing! I mean, maybe some of the Wonderbolts started calling me Rainbow Crash...\nFluttershy: Oh, no! Isn't that the same terrible nickname those bullies in flight school used to call you?\nRainbow Dash: [whimpering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Why would they call you that?\nRainbow Dash: Well, I kinda sorta fell into a garbage can. [whimpering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Urgh.\nPinkie Pie: Well, look at the bright side! At least they didn't call you Rainbow Trash!\nApplejack: So you started off on the wrong hoof. I'll bet every new Wonderbolt has a tough first day.\nRarity: Mmm-hmm! What you need is to find a positive way to stand out. As soon as you're known for something else, that nasty old nickname will be forgotten.\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity's right. Why don't you think of the Wonderbolts like us? We're a team, but we all stand out in different ways.\nRainbow Dash: That's it! I'm gonna stand out in a different way, just like you guys! Goodbye, Rainbow Crash; hello, Captain Awesome!\n[zoom]\n\nRainbow Dash: [imitating Pinkie Pie] Good morning, everypony! Who's ready for a fantastic day of flying? I know I am! I just couldn't be more excited for the big show tomorrow. Are you guys excited? I'm excited! Actually, I'm always excited! Some ponies even call me \"Dynamic Dash\"!\n[balloon pops]\nRainbow Dash: [imitating Pinkie Pie] Because I'm so full of energy all the time! [panting like a dog]\nFleetfoot: Uh, Wonderbolts don't get excited, Crash. You gotta keep a level head to fly the way we do.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] [imitating Applejack] Well, of course I know that! But the truth of the matter is, you should be excited! It's the dream of near every little Pegasus pony to grow up and fly with the Wonderbolts! And here you all are doin' it!\nFleetfoot: So are you.\nRainbow Dash: [imitating Applejack] True! Go ahead and call me \"Forthright Filly\" if you want. But shee-yucks, I like to tell it like it is, and I believe a pony oughta appreciate hard work payin' off like this, because bein' a Wonderbolt is somethin' special!\nMisty Fly: We know.\n[door slams]\n\n[whoosh]\nRainbow Dash: [imitating Twilight Sparkle] You know, I was just reading about how dihedral wing angles can help increase stability in banking turns. It made me think that pre-flight checklists could really help increase our efficiency, so I went ahead and made them for everypony!\n[papers flapping]\nRainbow Dash: [imitating Twilight Sparkle] I'm always finding so much interesting information in books. In fact, a lot of ponies call me \"Reading Rainboom\".\nSpitfire: [through loudhailer] We all know how wings work, newbie! And we already have checklists! Now get off the runway!\nRainbow Dash: [imitating Fluttershy] I'm so sorry. I was just trying to help because I care about all of the Wonderbolts oh-so much. Yessiree, just call me \"Care Mare\". [beat] Um, but if you're busy now, I can just come back later...\nSpitfire: [low growl]\nRainbow Dash: [imitating Fluttershy] Or, you know, not at all...\n[zip]\n\n[rubbing]\nRainbow Dash: [to herself] Okay. [imitating Rarity] I must tell you how much I just love these uniforms. Why, ever since I was a foal, I've admired the mixture of bold lines and classic contours. They don't call me \"Rainbow Fash\" for nothing.\nSoarin: Uhhhh... huh...?\nRainbow Dash: [imitating Rarity] The \"Fash\" is for \"Fashion\".\nSpitfire: Crash! I'm not sure why you're acting like this, but you need to stop.\nRainbow Dash: I was just, you know, trying to show everypony all the awesome ways I can contribute to the 'Bolts.\nSpitfire: I know you're excited to find your place on the team, but just focus on the routine for now, okay?\nRainbow Dash: Yes, ma'am.\nSpitfire: Maybe this will help motivate you.\n[thud]\n[locker opens]\n[Wonderbolts motif plays]\nRainbow Dash: Crash?! Couldn't you just put my regular name on it?!\nSpitfire: That's not how it works around here. We all have our nicknames on our jackets. Right, Clipper?\nRainbow Dash: Clipper?\nSoarin: Right, boss!\n[locker shuts]\nSpitfire: Now it's official. Welcome to the Wonderbolts, Crash! [laughs]\n[thud]\nRainbow Dash: [groans] If I don't come up with something unforgettable to add to the routine, I'm gonna be Rainbow Crash for the rest of my life!\n[locker shuts]\n\nScootaloo: This is gonna be so amazing!\nSpike: I know! I'm almost as excited as Pinkie Pie!\nPinkie Pie: I can't wait to see Rainbow Dash's first performance as an honest-to-goodness Wonderbolt! I hope there's cotton candy!\n[zip]\nFluttershy: We should all remember to be extra supportive for Rainbow Dash too.\nRarity: Excellent point. It's simply dreadful that she's had such a rough start after finally achieving her dream.\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash is a pretty resilient pony. I'm sure she's shaken off her tough first day and turned it around by now!\nApplejack: Speakin' of... Hey, Dash!\nRainbow Dash: Perfect! Hey, can I borrow Scootaloo?\nScootaloo: Me? What for?\nRainbow Dash: Oh, heh, I just needed some help and figured the president of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club was the right pony for the job!\nTwilight Sparkle: I thought the Wonderbolt Reserves were here to help.\nRainbow Dash: Oh, yeah, they're all busy doing, uh, official Reserve stuff. But don't worry! With Scootaloo's help, everything's gonna be awesome. Better than awesome!\nRarity: Does... Does that mean practice went well yesterday?\nRainbow Dash: Gotta go.\n\nScootaloo: What are we doing up here, Rainbow Dash?\nRainbow Dash: I just need a small favor from you that's really gonna make this show something special. Now, the Wonderbolts are gonna fly over this ridge right before the finale of the show. I'll fly by last, and when I signal you, you zip up the ramp on your scooter and kick the storm cloud into my path!\nScootaloo: What?\nRainbow Dash: That kick will shoot off a lightning bolt right behind me, making me look totally awesome! And then I'll do some incredible Rainbow Dash flying with it to create the coolest, show-stoppingest, lightning-tastic light show anypony has ever seen!\nScootaloo: Are you sure about this?\nRainbow Dash: Uh-huh! It's gonna be so awesome! And nopony will ever call me \"Rainbow Crash\" after this!\n[engines roaring]\nRainbow Dash: Oh, gotta go! Be ready for me, okay, Scootaloo?\nScootaloo: Um... okay...?\n\nAnnouncer: [through loudspeaker] Mares and gentlecolts, fillies and foals of all ages! Look to the skies and prepare to be awestruck by the incredible flying prowess of... the Wonderbolts!\n[engines roaring]\n[crowd cheering]\nFluttershy: I hope Spike and Pinkie Pie are done getting their snacks, or they're gonna miss Rainbow Dash!\nRarity: Oh, don't worry, Fluttershy. Nothing would keep Pinkie Pie from missing this!\nApplejack: Heh. Except maybe cotton candy.\n\n[engines roaring]\nSpike: Come on, Pinkie, the show's starting!\nPinkie Pie: One second! Just a little bit bigger please, but hurry! Bigger!\n\n[engines roaring]\n[crowd awed]\n[fighter plane engine whines]\n[crowd cheers]\nTwilight Sparkle: That was amazing! She's doing great!\n\nPinkie Pie: Bigger!\n[cotton candy stretching]\nSpike: [sighs]\n\n[whooshing]\n[screeching]\nScootaloo: I hope this works.\n[thwack]\n[crowd cheering]\n[storm cloud crackling]\nRainbow Dash: [yelps]\n[storm cloud crackling]\n[leaves being dislodged]\nRainbow Dash: [multiple yelps]\nCrowd: [gasps]\nRainbow Dash: [grunts, screams]\n[crash]\nRainbow Dash: [grunts, screams]\n[lightning]\n[downed fighter plane engine noise]\nPinkie Pie: Hope I'm not too late. [scoffs] I dunno what took that pony so long.\nRainbow Dash: [screams]\n[splat]\nRainbow Dash: [groans]\nPinkie Pie: That was amazing!\nSpitfire: Way to go, Rainbow Crash.\n\nRainbow Dash: [sighs]\nSpitfire: You gonna tell us what just happened, newbie?\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] I'm so sorry.\nSpitfire: I should hope so. You changed the routine without consulting me and put other ponies at risk. I've drummed flyers out of the 'Bolts for less.\nRainbow Dash: I know, and I'm ready for whatever punishment you want. You guys were right to call me \"Rainbow Crash\". I've always been a standout flyer, but since I joined the Wonderbolts, I've only stood out for making mistakes. [sighs] It's been my dream my whole life, but... I guess maybe I'm not Wonderbolt material after all.\nSoarin: Are you serious?! You're the most talented flyer we've ever had!\nFleetfoot: And you've saved all of Equestria like, a dozen times.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, I\u2014\nSpitfire: Of course you're supposed to be a Wonderbolt. We've been waiting for a spot to open up ever since you joined the Reserves!\nRainbow Dash: But... you guys all called me Rainbow Crash.\nSoarin: Yeah, so? My nickname's \"Clipper\". You know why they call me that?\nRainbow Dash: Uh... 'cause you're as fast as a ship?\nSoarin: Because I clipped my wing on a flagpole as I was landing on my first day. Heh.\nRainbow Dash: Huh.\nFleetfoot: \"Flatfoot\". My first day, I misjudged my landing and came down right on Spitfire's hoof.\nMisty Fly: \"Dizzy\".\nSurprise: \"Slowpoke\".\nHigh Winds: \"Hoof-in-Mouth\".\nSpitfire: You don't wanna know what they call me. [unintelligible whisper]\nRainbow Dash: Whoa! That is so much worse than Crash.\nSpitfire: Right?\nRainbow Dash: So does this mean I'm... still on the team?\nSpitfire: Do you think you can be part of this team and not constantly try to showboat?\nRainbow Dash: I promise! I spent my whole life trying to be a standout flyer, but now that I'm a Wonderbolt, it's time to be okay with fitting in!\nSpitfire: Good, because I really didn't want to miss the chance to tease you for years about this catastrophe! I mean, that crash was epic!\n[Wonderbolts laughing]\nSpitfire: But you're on probation for a month. Got a problem with that?!\nRainbow Dash: [quickly] No, ma'am.\n\n[sweeping]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey. Rainbow Dash. We just wanted to check on you. Are you doing okay?\nRainbow Dash: I'm doing great, thanks!\nScootaloo: Sure you don't need any help?\nRainbow Dash: Nah. This mess is my responsibility, and I've gotta clean it up myself. And after this, Spitfire's got me cleaning the Wonderbolts' compound for the next month.\nScootaloo: So why are you in such a good mood?\nRainbow Dash: Duh! Because I'm a Wonderbolt!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[Ponies]\nPonies' voices fill the night\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\nHappy hearts so full and bright\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\nOh, what a sight\nLook at the light\nAll for tonight\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\n\nPonies' voices fill the night\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\nHappy hearts so full and bright\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\nOh, what a sight\nLook at the light\nAll for tonight\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\n\n[Fluttershy]\nClouds arranged so they're just so\n\nClouds arranged so they're just so\n\n[Pegasi]\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\n\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\n\n[Rainbow Dash]\nGonna make some awesome snow\n\nGonna make some awesome snow\n\n[Pegasi]\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\n\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\n\n[Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash]\nThe chill wind blows\nMaking a show\nSnowflakes aglow\n\nThe chill wind blows\nMaking a show\nSnowflakes aglow\n\n[Ponies]\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\n\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\n\n[Pinkie Pie]\nA day that's filled with songs to sing\n\nA day that's filled with songs to sing\n\n[Ponies]\nDing-dong, ding-dong-ding\n\nDing-dong, ding-dong-ding\n\n[Applejack]\nCakes and pastries we shall bring\n\nCakes and pastries we shall bring\n\n[Ponies]\nDing-dong, ding-dong-ding\nWe're so busy making merry\nWindigos should all be wary\n\nDing-dong, ding-dong-ding\nWe're so busy making merry\nWindigos should all be wary\n\n[Stallions]\nAs our mighty voices carry\n\nAs our mighty voices carry\n\n[Ponies]\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\n\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\n\n[Rarity]\nDecorations we shall make\n\nDecorations we shall make\n\n[Ponies]\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\n\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\n\n[Rarity]\nPerfection you just cannot fake\n\nPerfection you just cannot fake\n\n[Ponies]\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\n\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again\n\n[Rarity]\nNot one mistake\nDon't let that break\nOh, goodness' sake!\n\nNot one mistake\nDon't let that break\nOh, goodness' sake!\n\n[Ponies]\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once a\u2014\nHappy, happy Hearth's Warming Eve\nHappy, happy Hearth's Warming Eve\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey, Starlight!

It's mostly a day dedicated to presents and candy, isn't it?\nSpike: And why would you deny yourself presents and candy? That's crazy talk!\nTwilight Sparkle: I think what Spike means to say is Hearth's Warming is about more than presents and candy. It's a time to spend with friends and family when we celebrate a very important day in Equestria's history.\nStarlight Glimmer: I think to most ponies, it's just an excuse for silly songs and fun, not a day to remember some old story.\n[magic zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe you just haven't heard the right Hearth's Warming Eve story yet!\nStarlight Glimmer: Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns sing songs around a hearth to fight back an eternal winter caused by the mythical windigos? Ha! Every foal and filly knows that story.\nTwilight Sparkle: Not that one. My favorite holiday story, \"A Hearth's Warming Tale\"!\nSpike: Oh, I love that one!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: This is the story of a powerful unicorn named Snowfall Frost, who hated Hearth's Warming Eve. It all began many moons ago in Canterlot...\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [narrating] Every home in Canterlot was filled with holiday spirit. Every home... except one. It was said of Snowfall that she was almost as studied as Star Swirl the Bearded. Almost, since everypony knows that Star Swirl was an expert at everything from transfiguration, dimensional calibration, teleportation\u2014\nSpike: [narrating] We get it. Star Swirl's awesome.\nTwilight Sparkle: [narrating] Right. The point is, Snowfall was also a powerful unicorn. She wanted to be perfect. Anything that got in the way of that was a waste of time.\n[bells ringing]\nStarlight Glimmer: [gasp] Well, that batch is ruined. Snowdash!\nTwilight Sparkle: [narrating] Snowdash was Snowfall's loyal assistant.\nRainbow Dash: What do you need?\nStarlight Glimmer: Get this mess cleaned up. Those foolish ponies were ringing those blasted bells outside the window and I lost my concentration!\nRainbow Dash: [under her breath] Whoa, ponies actually enjoying Hearth's Warming Eve. Where did they get that crazy idea?\nStarlight Glimmer: Today is nothing to celebrate. Hearth's Warming Eve is a menace. A dangerous day for all of Equestria.\nRainbow Dash: Dangerous?! It's awesome! It's the day we remember how unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth ponies came together in friendship to defeat the windigos!\nStarlight Glimmer: That silly legend is the problem! Telling everypony that \"singing songs and being nice\" will solve anything? I've spent years studying magic, and that's not how it works.\nRainbow Dash: I think you might be missing the point.\n[magic zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Work hard, learn, and use your skills to better Equestria.

Snowfall doesn't like Hearth's Warming Eve so she decides to cast a spell to get rid of it altogether? That seems a little extreme.\nSpike: [muttering] Says the pony who tried to make everypony the same by replacing their cutie marks with equal signs. [sips cocoa]\nTwilight Sparkle: I think what Spike is trying to say is that everypony has their reasons for doing things. Even Snowfall. And if I could continue the story, we might just find out what they are.\nSpike: Proceed.\nTwilight Sparkle: Snowfall was all set to cast her spell that would erase Hearth's Warming Eve for all time...\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [narrating] ...when a voice from the hearth caught her attention.\nApplejack: You sure you wanna go through with this?\nStarlight Glimmer: Huh?! Who's there?!\n[bubbling]\nApplejack: The Spirit of Hearth's Warmin' Past, that's who. And you and me have got to have us a little chat.\nStarlight Glimmer: A spirit?! [suspiciously] I didn't cast any spirit summoning spell. What are you doing here?\nApplejack: You don't think a spell like that would get by without some powerful forces noticin'? You've got our attention, Snowfall Frost, and we've got some pretty strong opinions on this spell of yours.\nStarlight Glimmer: \"We\"?\nApplejack: They'll be along in a bit. For now, it's just you and me. Let's get a move on. We got a ton to see and barely any time to see it.\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm not going anywhere. I've got a spell to cast, and I don't need a history lesson about Hearth's Warming Eve.\nApplejack: We aren't goin' to the past to learn about the holiday. We're goin' to learn about you.\nStarlight Glimmer: [yelps] [wailing]\n\n[Applejack]\nAs a young thing, life sure is somethin'\nYou go makin' choices large and small\nAlways growin' like a seedlin'\nAnd playin' is like dreamin'\nAnd before you know it, big and tall\n\nAs a young thing, life sure is somethin'\nYou go makin' choices large and small\nAlways growin' like a seedlin'\nAnd playin' is like dreamin'\nAnd before you know it, big and tall\n\nAnd every little bitty choice you make\nSends you down a path to who you are today\nSo let's take a little trip down memory lane\nAnd see just what the past has to say\n\nAnd every little bitty choice you make\nSends you down a path to who you are today\nSo let's take a little trip down memory lane\nAnd see just what the past has to say\n\nAw, look how cute you were.

Real magic takes time to learn.\n[ornament shattering]\nProfessor Flintheart: It's your choice.

Here, want a cupcake?\nStarlight Glimmer: Fine, \"Presents\". All of the pointless things ponies waste their time on.\nPinkie Pie: Oh, Snowfall, it's not what the gift is that matters, it's what the gift means!\nStarlight Glimmer: It doesn't mean anything. It's just stuff!\nPinkie Pie: Exactly! Sometimes a cupcake means \"I love you!\" Or a toy means \"Hi, how're you doing?\" Sometimes a book means \"Your mane looks amazing!\" And sometimes a scarf means... Well, a scarf usually means you look cold. That one's easy.\nStarlight Glimmer: I don't understand anything you're saying.\nPinkie Pie: Whoa! Whoa!

Please, no spoilers.\nFluttershy: But\u2014\nRarity: No spoilers!\n\n[theme song]\n\nRarity: Now, is everypony ready to hear what I'm sure is a stellar review that describes in stunning detail exactly how each of you contributed to the successful opening of Rarity For You?\n[zip]\nRarity: [clears throat, reading] \"Many a pony has tried their hoof at joining the ranks of the elite fashion trendsetters currently ensconced in the boutiques of Manehattan's famed Saddle Row.\" [giggles, continues reading] \"Some might say it's the ultimate achievement in Equestrian fashion, and never before has a reporter been granted such unfettered behind-the-scenes access until now!\"\nFluttershy: I wish it had been more fettered.\nRarity: Oh, uh...

[reading] \"I sat down with...\" [giggles, continues reading] \"...Rarity and her friends after the opening to get the inside scoop, and what a scoop it was!\"\n\nBuried Lede: Okay, kid, ya successfully opened a shop in Manehattan and that's no mean feat! Most ponies might wonder what it feels like. Here's how it's gonna be: I'm gonna interview you and your friends so I can paint a picture of how it all came together. A word picture, mind you, not an actual picture. Any questions?\nRarity: Well, I was wondering\u2014\nBuried Lede: Let's get started! Ms. Rarity, you've got shops all over Equestria, but this was your first time trying to make it in the big city. What made ya think you could tackle it on your own?\nRarity: Well, I wouldn't say all over Equestria. I just have two other boutiques: one in my hometown of Ponyville, and one in Canterlot. Uh, still, when I decided to open this one, I was nothing but confident.\n\n[bell dings]\nTwilight Sparkle: Let's just say that if I could choose, I probably wouldn't do it that way again. Heh.\n\nPinkie Pie: Well, it wasn't the funnest party ever...\n\nApplejack: It was a plum-puckered, pig-pushin' disaster!\n\nRainbow Dash: After a lifetime of awesome, I think everypony's allowed to mess up every now and then, right?\n[pencil writing]\nRainbow Dash: Wait, are you writing this down?\n\nFluttershy: Um, it didn't go exactly how I thought it would, but it, um, started out all right.\n\nRarity: Welcome to Saddle Row, an entire street lined with the most fashionable boutiques in all of Equestria!\nApplejack: If it's supposed to be the most fashionable block of shops, where's Stinky Bottom's Discount Hat Emporium?\nRarity: I suppose it didn't make the cut. [gasps] Here it is! Rarity For You!\n\n[door opens]\n[shelf breaks]\n[mouse squeaks]\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity, it's lovely. But are you sure you'll be ready to open tonight?\nPinkie Pie: [inhales] [sneezes]\nRarity: No need to fret over a mere moderate amount of preparation. My clothes arrive soon, my sales associate after that, and with a little... dusting, we'll be ready for the grand opening tonight.\nMr. Stripes: Rarity! So good to see you! Your store, it's going to be a very good place, I think! [laughs]\n\nRarity: Mr. Stripes owns the building. He's a very pleasant landlord. Although he can be pushy at times. [beat] Okay, all the time.\n\nMr. Stripes: You've met my daughter, the apple of my ear, the hay in my hoof? You will let her work with you.\nRarity: [chuckles nervously] It's just, I'm dreadfully busy preparing for tonight's grand opening, as you can see.\nMr. Stripes: There are only two things I love more than being pushy. One is my daughter. The other is miniature doll furniture. And I would sell my entire mini-furniture collection to make my daughter happy. You understand?\n[poit, poit, poit]\nRarity: I'm sorry. I just don't think it's going to be possible.\nMr. Stripes: Let me say another way... Hire her or I raise rent until you no can afford!\nRarity: Oh, uh, welcome aboard.\nPlaid Stripes: [loudly] First idea! Instead of clothes, we sell glow-in-the-dark teeth! Like this. [chomp, chomp] But they glow in the dark!\nRarity: Golly, what a splendid idea! [chuckles nervously]\n\nRarity: Glow-in-the-dark teeth! What was she thinking?!\n\nRarity: Aah! Fluttershy, your assistance is required in the stock room, posthaste!\nFluttershy: Aw, hello.\nRarity: But what are they doing here?\n[raccoons chittering]\nFluttershy: Smoky made too much noise eating garbage, so Softpad's mother made them move out of the trashcan.\n\nFluttershy: Then Smoky Jr. found a nice home in the crawl space behind the building. But Mr. Stripes demolished it, so they were temporarily camped out in the back until they found a new place to live.\n\nRarity: No, no, no! I can't have a family of rubbish-scented raccoons living in my boutique!\n[dance music playing, chandelier creaks]\nRarity: Uh, did you hear that?\n\nRarity: [annoyed] Heh. Turns out there's a Club Pony Party Palace upstairs.\n\nPinkie Pie: [excitedly] Turns out there's a Club Pony Party Palace upstairs!\n\n[dance music continues]\nRarity: I'm sorry. Could you please ask her to turn it down? Could you ask her to turn it down, please? [pleading] Turn it down, please! [sobbing] Oh, please!\n\nRarity: Ugh! Foals today listen to their so-called \"music\" far too loud. I realize that makes me sound like an old mare. But this is business!\n\n[sweeping]\n[dance music playing, chandelier creaking]\nRainbow Dash: I wish we were having as much fun as they are.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, sweeping can be fun, too. [to the beat] Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep. Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep...\n\nRainbow Dash: Only Twilight could make a dance remix about sweeping. I mean, how lame is that?\nApplejack: Yeah. It wasn't even catchy.\nRainbow Dash: Nope.\n[hoof-bump]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [to the beat] Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep...\nTwilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, and Applejack: [to the beat] Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep...\nRarity: Apparently, DJ Pon-3 has a residency at the Party Palace upstairs, but security won't let me speak to her.\n[honk!]\nRarity: Aah! What in the name of Celestia was that?!\n\nPlaid Stripes: You know how most stores have a little jingle-bell when the door opens? Ahem. I thought we should have something with a little more pizzazz! So, I installed one of Daddy's antique horns.\n\n[honk! honk! honk!]\nRarity: [sighs] We'll have to do something about that, after I think of a way to quiet down that music. And after I finish designing the window display!\n[crash!]\nRarity: Ahh! Wait, is this my merchandise shipment from Ponyville? It's completely disorganized! A\u2014A\u2014... [sighs]\nCoco Pommel: [sneezes]\nRarity: Gesundheit! Oh, Miss Pommel! I'm so glad to see you! Now, as the sole sales associate at Rarity For You, I hate to add to your already overflowing plate of responsibilities, but it looks as though we have just a tad more to do before tonight than I thought.\nCoco Pommel: Actually, I\u2014 [sneezes] I can't work tonight.\nRarity: Oh? Why not?\n\nCoco Pommel: [blowing nose]\n\nCoco Pommel: [sneezes]\nRarity: Feel better, my sweet. We'll manage without you... somehow. And we'll manage glowing teeth and car horns and disorganized clothes and dance music! Am I forgetting anything?\n[raccoons chittering]\nRarity: [sobbing] What am I going to do?!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, opening a store in Manehattan is a pretty big deal. It's natural that Rarity would be a little stressed about how it was going. Since it wasn't going well. Still, I think she handled it all right.\n\nRarity: My dream is doomed! Doomed, I tell you! Doomed!\nTwilight Sparkle: I know things haven't gone perfectly so far, but we've done this kind of thing before. If we all work together\u2014\nRarity: I appreciate the offer, but this is Manehattan. To make it in the fashion scene here, everything has to be perfect. The perfect location! The perfect clothes! The perfect opening!\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe we should just postpone.\nRarity: Postpone?! Darling, tonight is the last night of the fall season. If we don't open tonight, it won't be...\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Perfect.\nRarity: Yes. I know what needs to be done. I just need more of me! Oh, how I wish I could make copies of myself!\n\nPinkie Pie: Yeah... Making copies of yourself always sounds like a great idea, but before you know it, you're locked in a room with fifty Pinkie Pies watching paint dry.\n[syrup splashes]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: We can do this. And we can stay true to your vision.\nRarity: You'd do that? Fluttershy, you'll handle those... strong-smelling raccoons for me?\nFluttershy: Of course.\nApplejack: Leave Plaid Stripes to me. I'll handle her and her, uh, \"good ideas\".\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, ooh, ooh! And I can go upstairs to that nonstop party and have tons of fun and eat some cake and set off party cannons and\u2014\nRarity: [clears throat]\nPinkie Pie: And then make them be quiet.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm pretty sure I know somepony who wouldn't mind organizing this merchandise shipment for you. [beat] I'm talking about myself. [beat] [pleading] Oh, please, let me organize it!\nRarity: This all sounds splendid, but I don't even have a single employee, and I'll need the best of the best.\nRainbow Dash: Leave the hiring to me.\nRarity: Oh! This is it, my dears. If you can handle these problems, I'll focus on the designs for the front window display. We'll show Manehattan what Rarity For You is all about! Oh, what would I do without you?\n\nRainbow Dash: What would she do without us? Huh. Lemme think. [imitating Rarity] \"Darlings, I'm absolutely doomed, doomed, doomed!\" [laughs, normal voice] Heh, I sound just like her!\n[pencil scratching]\nRainbow Dash: Hey, you're not writing this down, are you?\n\nRarity: Now for the perfect window display. Hmm.\n\n[dance music playing]\nPinkie Pie: Oh, I can't really stop a super fun party in the middle of mega-happy fun times, can I?! Oh, what would Rarity want?!\nRarity Devil: Keep that party going 'til the break of dawn!\nPinkie Pie: Really?\nRarity Angel: Indubitably! And as for the roof, get jiggy! Raise it, Pinkie! Raise it like you've never raised it before!\nPinkie Pie: Oh! If you say so!\nRarity Devil: Oh, please, Pinkie Pie. Never in a million years would I say such balderdash!\n[poof]\n[poof]\nPinkie Pie: Oh.\n[screech]\nPinkie Pie: Obviously, DJ Pon-3 only plays the sickest of beats. I just wouldn't want her to miss out on the coolest new music straight from the back-alley underground, zip-zap party scene! [to DJ Pon-3] I'd play the whole thing if I were you, no matter what other ponies think.\n[record scratches]\n[shopping music plays]\nDancers: Awww.\n\nRainbow Dash: Rarity For You is only hiring the best of the best. And to me, that means the fastest. Now, uh, before we begin, uh... [to herself] Am I doing this right? What would Rarity want? [to applicants] New plan!\n[zip!]\nRainbow Dash: Who can be the first one to tell me what fabric this is?\nBlue Bobbin: That's organza.\nRainbow Dash: Are you sure?\nBlue Bobbin: It's a thin, plain weave. Sheer fabric traditionally made from silk, so... yeah.\n\nRainbow Dash: I don't know the first thing about clothes. Pretty much all I can do is look at something and tell you if it's clothes or not. This chair? Not clothes.\n\nPlaid Stripes: See if you can keep up with me here. What are all clothes made of?\nApplejack: Uh, fabric?\nPlaid Stripes: Bingo! But not in this store. Uh-uh. Not anymore.\nApplejack: Oh, no?\nPlaid Stripes: Two words for you: \"spoon clothes\". All our clothes will be made of spoons!\nApplejack: [sighs, to herself] What would Rarity want? [to Plaid Stripes] You know, I like you, Plaid Stripes. If it were up to me, we'd have a spoon clothes store right next to Stinky Bottom's Discount Hat Emporium. But it ain't up to me, so the answer is no.\n\nApplejack: Personally, I think spoon clothes ain't such a bad idea. Useful, too. Eatin' soup, stirrin' gumbo, diggin' little holes.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: There. Perfect. Although, what would Rarity want? Maybe she wouldn't like it done by color. Guess I have to start over!\n\nFluttershy: Hello, Smoky, Softpad, Smoky Jr.? I have some... interesting news. I, oh... I'd like you all to stay here forever, but... [to herself] What would Rarity want? [to the raccoons] You have to move out! [sobs]\n[raccoons shriek]\n\nRarity: A window display is the first thing customers see, and if they like it, they'll walk inside and experience the glory that is my boutique.\n\nRainbow Dash: [stammers] I don't know which one of you to hire! Just... keep guessing fabrics!\nPlaid Stripes: Daddy, Rarity's friend doesn't like my ideas!\nMr. Stripes: Spoon clothes is good idea!\n[dance music playing]\nPinkie Pie: Oh, no! Not a shopping music mashup!\n[raccoons growling]\nFluttershy: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!\n[knob jiggles]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\n[slow motion sounds]\nRarity: How's it\u2014\n[door slams]\nRarity: Ooh!\n\nFluttershy: When you write the story, could you maybe skip over the part where we locked Rarity in the window display? [nervous chuckle]\n\nRarity: Hello? The door appears to be stuck!\nTwilight Sparkle: Yep. We're workin' on it!\nRarity: Hmm. Well, shouldn't let this time go to waste.\n\n[ponies chattering and raccoons chittering]\nTwilight Sparkle: How did this happen?\nPinkie Pie: I shut down the party.\nApplejack: I told Plaid Stripes no.\nFluttershy: I asked the raccoons to leave.\nRainbow Dash: I asked a lot of fabric questions.\nPinkie Pie, Applejack, Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash: Just like I thought Rarity would want!\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity asked us to help her with everything because she knows all of us so well. [to Fluttershy] She knows how much you care for animals. She'd trust you to solve the problem your way. [to the others] Maybe we should all do the same. Doing this our way is what Rarity wants. It's not too late. Let's all dig in and we can fix this.\n[ponies chattering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Before Rarity finds out how bad we messed up.\n\nFluttershy: I'm sorry I asked you to leave. The place is yours if you wanna stay. Though I would like to ask you all just one favor.\n\nPinkie Pie: I'm sorry I made you play that un-fun, super-boring music. But if you're up for it, I have an idea to make the party even better!\n\nRainbow Dash: Okay, I don't get fabric, but I do get speed. And I need somepony fast enough to help all the customers Rarity's gonna have. So... first one to the river and back gets the job! [beat] It's a race! Go!\n\nApplejack: [clears throat] Mr. Stripes, I owe your daughter an apology. She's got good ideas, and I should give 'em a chance. So here's what I'm thinkin'.\n\n[taxi rattling]\n\nRarity: Perfect!\n[doorknob rattling]\n[door opens]\n[thump]\nTwilight Sparkle: [awkwardly] Wow, looks like we fixed that door just in time!\nRarity: [gasps] Oh! What's all this?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: The whole place organized by style, cross-referenced by size, and reverse-indexed by fabric. She'll be able to find anything in three seconds flat! It was some of my best work.\n\nRarity: Oh! I knew I could count on you! All right... I suppose this is the moment of truth...\n[door opens, bell rings]\nRarity: Rarity For You is now open!\n[ponies chattering]\nRarity: Oh, dear. I wasn't quite prepared for such a crowd. How will I handle them all?\nBlue Bobbin: My name's Blue Bobbin. I'll be your personal shopping assistant this evening.\nRainbow Dash: Right this way, everypony, and one of our talented salesponies can help you out!\n\nRainbow Dash: Honestly, they were all pretty slow. But they finished the race. Plus they knew a lot more about fabric than I did. So, I hired them all!\n\n[music starts]\n\nPinkie Pie: The way I see it, Rarity designs fashion, DJ Pon-3 designs beats. What better combination than a boutique/dance club?\n\nFluttershy: After a quick bath, they were more than willing to help!\n[splat]\n\n\"Waxton\": Ah, a blue corn reduction with shallot confit! But how can I possibly enjoy it without a\u2014\nPlaid Stripes: Spoon?\n\nApplejack: Heh. Toldja spoon clothes ain't such a bad idea.\n\n\"Waxton\": [sips] Mmm! Exquisite! This is the most whimsical and wonderfully fashionable boutique I've ever seen!\n[ponies chattering]\n\nRarity: [reading] \"In the end, Rarity's grand opening was a smashing success! True, it got off to a rocky start, but somehow this rag-tag group of ne'er-do-wells...\" [to ponies] Oh, heavens, I think he means you. [continues reading] \"...came together and created the perfect boutique. A vision of Rarity combined with the expertise of her friends! This reporter, for one, is a believer.\" [to ponies] Why didn't you tell me there were so many problems?\nTwilight Sparkle: We all figured you had enough on your mind.\nApplejack: And we didn't want you to think that the opening wasn't perfect.\nRarity: [giggles] \"Ne'er-do-wells\" or not, I know I can always count on all of you. And nothing could be more perfect than that.\n\nPlaid Stripes: [sipping]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[steam hisses]\nRarity: [sighs]\nAloe: Um... Miss Rarity? Eh, how much longer are you planning to stay in here, darling?\nRarity: Oh, dear. Is somepony else waiting?\nAloe: Oh, no, no. I just don't want you to get all... What is word? Pruney.\nRarity: Oh. Uh, well, I'm just waiting for Applejack. It's been so long since we've had a relaxing day at the spa together. I'm quite certain she'll be along any moment.\n[door closes]\n[steam hisses]\n\n[door opens]\nApplejack: Hey, there, Rarity. I really tried to get here earlier. I just can't believe how much time my chores are takin' up these days. At least now we'll finally get to spend some quality spa time together. Right?\nAloe: Okay, fillies, that's it. We are closing up for the day.\n[door closes]\nApplejack: Aw, shucks, Rarity. I guess I missed the whole day. I sure am sorry.\nRarity: Me, too.\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Hi, Rarity!\nRarity: Morning, Twilight, Spike. Good heavens, that's a lot of empty pie plates.\nSpike: Uh... yeah. We were just heading to pick up some fresh pies. Heh. I don't know why we keep running out at the castle. [nervous laugh] What are you gonna get?\nRarity: Applejack, actually. Although, I'm quite sure she'll be too busy once again.\nTwilight Sparkle: What do you mean?\nRarity: Oh, nothing. It's just that Applejack and I haven't had one of our spa days in ages.\nTwilight Sparkle: You two really should set aside some time.\nRarity: Darling, I have been trying for moons! But Applejack is so busy these days, it's next to impossible.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow. I didn't realize Applejack had so much to do.\n\n[timer buzzes]\n[oven door opens]\n[oven door closes]\nSpike: Hey, Applejack! Another order of pies, please.\nApplejack: Sure thing, Spike!\nSpike: Aah! Dah! Whoa-oa-oa!\nRarity: I don't suppose those pies are the last chore on the schedule for today?\nApplejack: Gah! Land's sakes! Is it time for our spa day already? Rarity, why don't you go on ahead and I'll meet ya there?\nRarity: Oh! Please, Applejack, let's not kid ourselves!\nApplejack: Well, it ain't 'cause I don't wanna. But the work on the farm has just been takin' up more and more of my time.\nTwilight Sparkle: I hate seeing you two not spending time together. Can't you get somepony else in your family to take over for a bit?\nApplejack: [sighs] Wish I could. But Granny, Big Mac, and Apple Bloom all have chores of their own. And today, they're all busy takin' the harvest to market.\nTwilight Sparkle: I know we're not farmers, but I'm sure Spike and I could handle things for a little while.\nApplejack: Maybe...\nTwilight Sparkle: Is there one chore we could do?\nApplejack: Well... I suppose if you two got started on feedin' the pigs, I could maybe leave for an hour.\nRarity: Oooh! An hour of spa perfection? I can work with that!\nTwilight Sparkle: Perfect! You head out to the spa, and Spike and I'll take care of things here.\n[pie plates rattling]\nSpike: Whoa! Dah! Whoa!\n[whoosh]\nSpike: Uh, yeah. We totally got everything covered.\n\nApplejack: [sighs] Okay. This list pretty much covers everything you need to know to feed the pigs. But, uh, maybe I should go over it with you just to...\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack, please. If there's a list involved, I am one hundred percent on top of it.\nApplejack: Uh, right.\nTwilight Sparkle: And don't worry about things here! Spike and I have totally got this! I mean, it's just feeding the pigs. How hard could it be?\nSpike: Uh, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Whoa.\n\nApplejack: I'm glad we're doin' this, Rarity. I've been puttin' work before our spa time for too long. I know we've only got an hour, but I can't wait to have a steam.\nRarity: A steam is just the start. I know exactly what we'll do, and an hour will be perfect.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, Spike, ready with that list?\nSpike: Ready.\nTwilight Sparkle: Let's do this!\nSpike: [reading] \"Step one: open the gate.\"\n[gate creaks]\n[pigs oinking]\nSpike: Okay. [reading] \"Step two: close the gate.\"\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh?\nSpike: Mm. That's what it says.\n[gate creaks]\nSpike: [reading] \"Step three: walk away.\"\nTwilight Sparkle: \"Walk away\"? Really?\nSpike: [intonation of \"I don't know\"] Mmm.\n\nApplejack: I just hope Twilight and Spike can handle things until I get back.\nRarity: Now, Applejack, if we are really to enjoy this time together, you simply must give yourself over to the idea that you are off-duty and try to relax.\nApplejack: I know. You're right. I really am glad we're doin' this. And as long as it's only an hour, I'm sure everythin' will be just fine.\nRarity: Exactly. Now kindly step this way. Relaxation awaits.\n\n[door opens]\n[door closes]\nRarity: [gasps] Rainbow Dash! What are you doing here?!\nApplejack and Rarity: [giggle]\nApplejack: Yeah. I didn't think spa treatments were your thing exactly.\nRainbow Dash: What?!\n[robe and slippers thud]\nRainbow Dash: Oh, they're totally not. At least, not the froufrou kind.\nRarity: Ah.\nApplejack: Huh.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, I, uh, I think I tweaked something at Wonderbolts practice the other day. I just came in for a deep tissue sports massage.\n\"Lavender Essence\": Ah, Miss Dash, I am so sorry, but we are running just a tad behind, and we are not quite ready to start your pampered muscle massage and indulgent hooficure just yet.\nRainbow Dash: Oh! [chuckles nervously] I-I'm pretty sure that wasn't what I signed up for.\n\"Lavender Essence\": But they are your usual.\nRainbow Dash: And it seems like you're really busy today anyway! I'll just come back tomorrow. [to Rarity and Applejack] Uh, see you two later! Have fun! [to Lavender Essence, whispered] But put me down for the same thing.\n[whoosh]\nApplejack: [chuckles] Too bad Rainbow Dash just hates those \"froufrou\" spa treatments. She could have joined us for a nice steam. Hoo-wee! I can't wait.\nRarity: [laughs] Indeed. Although, if they couldn't fit Dashie in, I wonder just how far behind things are running. Obviously, we're on a very tight schedule.\n[thud]\nRarity: [grunts, gasps] Well, maybe not everypony is waiting for the steam room.\nCaramel: Oh, no. No, that's exactly what we're waiting for. Oh, I hope you're not in a hurry.\n\nApplejack: So everypony here wants a steam bath?\n[ponies confirming]\nRarity: Well, the solution is obvious. We'll simply have to start our short time at the spa with something else.\nApplejack: [scoffs] Nothin' doin'. I came here to have a steam, and that's just what I'm gonna get!\nRarity: But, but, it'll take most of our hour just to get through this line!\nAloe: RRRRarity! My favorite customer! Mwah! Mwah! And Appleyack? Well, it certainly has been a long time since you two were here together! So lovely to have you back.\nRarity: Well, I wish I could say the same.\nAloe: Yes, the wait time for the steam room certainly has been getting worse lately. But I'm sure we'll be able to accommodate your usual treatments.\nApplejack: Not without my steam!\nRarity: Apparently, Applejack won't consider starting her time at the spa without a steam, and we only have an hour.\nAloe: That is a problem.\nRarity: Applejack, where are you going?\n\n[ponies scoff and groan]\nApplejack: Um, why are y'all just standin' here?\nBuddy: Ugh! Just waiting for the steam to build up.\nSpoiled Rich: Without steam, a steam room's just a room, and I've got plenty of those at home. Because I live in a mansion.\n[clink, gauge hisses, needle creaks]\nAloe: It has been taking longer for the steam to reach the Ponyville Day Spa quality. We even had to add a warm towel service. So sorry for the delay, everypony. Please help yourselves.\nApplejack: So if you're not gettin' enough steam, that must mean there's not enough hot water.\nRarity: Ooh, Applejack, honestly, can't we just start with a hooficure? We're going to run out of time.\n\nApplejack: Hmm.\n[door opens]\n[loud whirring in distance]\nApplejack: Ha! Now what do we have here?\nRarity: The laundry room, of course. And at this point, I'm considering soaking my hooves in one of the machines so my time here isn't a total loss!\nAloe: The Ponyville Day Spa prides itself on sanitary conditions, and fresh linens are integral part.\nApplejack: Well, sure, but have you always run every single one of these here machines full bore all day, every day?\n\"Birch Bucket\": The answer is no. But ponies sure do love the warm towel service.\nApplejack: Hmmm.\n\n\"Birch Bucket\": Eh, you are all wanting towel?\nApplejack: Looks to me like you don't have any left.\n\"Birch Bucket\": Well, like I said, warm towels are big hit.\n[hissing]\nApplejack: I think I figured out the problem. You've got a small leak, and that means the steam takes just a little longer to build up. And while ponies wait, they get cold. Cold ponies start wrappin' themselves in towels, and all those dirty towels have to be cleaned because Ponyville Day Spa prides itself on cleanliness.\n\"Birch Bucket\": Eh, what?\nApplejack: Basically, losin' steam makes you use more towels. That means you do more laundry, which uses up the hot water you need to make more steam, so the problem just keeps gettin' worse.\nPonies: [talk at the same time]\nAloe: Ah! I had no idea.\nRarity: Wonderful. Now that we've solved the great steam mystery, we can finally get back to our... significantly less than an hour of relaxation.\nApplejack: Rarity, are you kiddin'? I can't just leave things like this. I'm gonna need my tools.\nRarity: [scoffs]\n\n[surf rock music]\n\n[clank]\nRarity: Ahh!\nApplejack: Whew! Now that that leak's fixed, ponies won't get so cold they use up all those towels! And without all that laundry, there'll be plenty of hot water for all the steam anypony could want!\n\"Birch Bucket\": And I only have to be doing vash once a day!\n[door closes]\nAloe: Wow, Appleyack! Have you ever considered a career in the spa industry? I'm sure I can find something for you.\nApplejack: [laughs] No, thanks. I'm just relieved I can finally relax in the steam. What do you say, Rarity?\nRarity: It sounds lovely, Applejack, but... unfortunately, you spent so much time fixing the steam room, we don't have any time left to use it. Honestly, how in Equestria did it never occur to you to check for leaks?\nAloe: There's just so many other things to worry about! I suppose ve get used to the way things are, and ve don't realize there vas problem.\nRarity: You obviously need an outside eye to evaluate the situation. It's lucky for you Applejack is too stubborn to relax!\nApplejack: Uh, I'm sorry, Rarity. We'll just have to do this another day. Twilight and Spike should be done feedin' the pigs by now.\nRarity: Twilight is a very capable pony. I'm sure she can figure out what to do next.\nApplejack: Look, I know Twilight's a princess and an Alicorn, but she isn't a farmer. I've been doin' farm work my whole life, and I'm not sure it's somethin' you can just \"figure out\".\nRarity: Of course. [gasps] Why don't we pop back so you could explain to Twilight what to do next, and then we'll come back here and pick up where we left off?\nApplejack: Well, I suppose I could try... assumin' everythin' went well so far.\nRarity: [laughing] Oh, Applejack, honestly! How could it not?\n\nSpike: Wouldn't it be easier to just fly?\nTwilight Sparkle: I told you, Spike. We're following Applejack's list to the letter, and Applejack doesn't fly! [straining] [yelps]\nSpike: [yelps]\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\nApplejack: I'm sorry, Rarity, but I think I'm gonna have to finish these chores myself.\nRarity: [grumbles]\n\nRarity: Twilight, darling! How in the world did you end up there?\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike and I were just trying to follow Applejack's list as closely as possible.\nSpike: Mmmh... Maybe not the best plan.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sorry, Applejack, but we never even got started feeding the pigs.\n[pigs snorting]\nApplejack: That's alright, Twilight. I know you did your best. I guess a list can't really capture all the ways I have of doin' things.\nTwilight Sparkle: At least you two got to spend some time at the spa together.\nSpike: Yeah, that must've been super relaxing!\nRarity: Well, if watching Applejack fix plumbing counts as relaxing, then yes.\nTwilight Sparkle: What about your hour of spa perfection?\nRarity: As it turns out, the Ponyville Day Spa had a few problems with their steam room, and somepony refused to relax until she had fixed them.\nApplejack: I'm sorry, but I just couldn't let those spa ponies go another minute puttin' up with problems they didn't even know they had! Somehow they just got used to a huge bottleneck of ponies standin' around waitin'. An' I took one good look at that spa jam, and I knew I had to do somethin'! Sometimes the simplest things can just derail a whole operation. [babbles] Whether it's a leaky pipe or doin' too much laundry. You can't just stick to the same old way of doin' things and expect them to get better. [clucking] I mean, thinkin' you can is just plumb ridiculous. Right? [short laugh] It's funny when you realize the extra work they were doin' was actually makin' things worse!\n[pigs squeal]\n[pigs stampeding]\nApplejack: I mean, I guess it's possible to get stuck in a routine where you're doin' all this extra stuff and not realize it, but I can't for the life of me think of how! [beat] Why are y'all starin' at me like that?\n[beat]\nRarity: Um... Are you certain everything you just did is entirely necessary to feed the pigs?\nApplejack: What? Of course! Why would I be doin' it if it weren't? See, this gate here used to squeak so loud, the pigs would run to the other side of the pen and never come out! So I open and close it to let them know it's safe.\nTwilight Sparkle: But it doesn't squeak anymore.\nApplejack: Of course not! I fixed that ages ago. Then I realized puttin' a little fright into 'em got 'em all hustlin' out of the pen.\nSpike: They don't look scared to me.\nApplejack: Well, no. They got used to it. Which is why I started doin' the chicken dance! To show 'em that if they didn't get to eatin' their food, the chickens would. 'Course, bein' a chicken, I couldn't very well open the gate. Gettin' the food bucket to spill into the trough was just a happy accident because one time I left it there by mistake.\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, Applejack? It seems like everything you're doing is to fix things that aren't really problems anymore.\nApplejack: Well, I'll be...\nRarity: Hmmm... Maybe it isn't so hard to get stuck doing extra work after all.\nApplejack: Huh. I wonder if I've been doin' that around here with anythin' else.\nRarity: Well, there's only one way to find out!\n\n[surf rock music]\n[chickens squawking]\n\n[valves squeaking, water sprinkling, repeating]\n\n[chicken wire rattling]\n[scissors snipping]\n\nApplejack: [sighs] Thanks, y'all. I guess I just got so used to doin' everythin' a certain way, I didn't realize there were any problems.\nTwilight Sparkle: Having a friend look at what you're doing with an outside eye can really help!\nRarity: Mm-hmm! And I suppose if it weren't for our unsuccessful time at the spa, none of us would've realized it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, now that your chores are streamlined, what are you gonna do with all the extra time?\nApplejack: I think I have a few ideas.\n\n[door opens]\nApplejack: [sighs] Think you can come up with enough things for us to do now that we have more time to relax?\nRarity: Oh, please. I could plan a week's worth of treatments!\nApplejack: Heh. Well, let's just start with the rest of the day for now. After all the work we just did on the farm, I am ready for some serious relaxation!\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Thanks for letting me know there was an opening. I don't know if I could make it without my pampered muscle massage.\nAloe: Don't vorry about it. Shall I put you down for another one tomorrow?\nRainbow Dash: Oh, absolutely! Sometimes a girl just has to pamper herself, am I right?\nRarity: You certainly are!\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] [stammering] Oh! Hey! I was just, uh, uh...\nApplejack: Gettin' a \"sports\" pamperin'? [giggles]\nRarity: [giggles] Don't worry, Rainbow Dash. We were just heading in for some pampering ourselves. You could always join us.\nApplejack: That is, if you don't mind sufferin' through one or two \"froufrou\" treatments.\nRainbow Dash: Uh... I suppose I could take it. You know, for you ponies.\nApplejack, Rainbow Dash and Rarity: [laughing]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nMrs. Shy: We're so happy you could come have lunch with your father and me, Fluttershy.\nFluttershy: I'm so glad you asked.\nRainbow Dash: And it was super awesome of you to invite me too!

Hey, where's the love? How about a little excitement to see your baby brother?\nFluttershy: I'm just surprised. When you left, you said mane therapy was your calling.\nZephyr Breeze: Oh, it is, sis, it is. You would not believe how much stress ponies hold in their manes. Everything gets limp and unmanageable. No offense, but brushing alone won't solve the problem.\nFluttershy: What went wrong?\nZephyr Breeze: Nothing went wrong, per se. It's just the powers that be were so locked into their required styles, and you know me. I've got my own style! And I think they were a little threatened.\nMrs. Shy: O-Oh, this is... lovely, dear.\nRainbow Dash: Ugh.\nZephyr Breeze: Welllll, if it ain't Rainbows \"The Best Flyer There Ever Was\" Dash!\nRainbow Dash: [flatly] Oh, this ought to be good.\nZephyr Breeze: Sorry, I shouldn't tease you.

Ms. Harshwhinny?!\nRainbow Dash: Zephyr Breeze.\nPinkie Pie: Oh, that makes more sense.\nApplejack: And from the look on your face, I'm guessin' it's for another one of his \"extended stays\"?\nRainbow Dash: She's a bit peeved.\nFluttershy: Zephyr's my brother, and I love him. But he's never learned to do anything for himself. I don't know why my parents keep letting him trot all over them!\nApplejack: Well, if your parents won't stand up for themselves, maybe you need to stand up for them.\nFluttershy: You know, you're right!\n\nFluttershy: [inhales and exhales]\n[smash!]\nFluttershy: [gasps]\n[smash!, thunder rumbling]\nFluttershy: Zephyr Breeze!\nZephyr Breeze: Oh, hey, sis. Come to see me work my magic and turn this place from drab to fab, huh? Well, watch and learn!\nFluttershy: Can't you see what you're doing?!\nZephyr Breeze: Yeah! I'm getting rid of this old stuff so I can turn the backhouse into my art studio! I've decided I'm gonna be a sculptor!\nFluttershy: I'm talking about Mom's flowers!\nZephyr Breeze: She's gonna move them so I can have my meditation patio here. She loves replanting stuff. Don't you, Mom?\nFluttershy: And Dad's been collecting his favorite bits of cloud from the factory since before you were born.\nMr. Shy: The very best from every production run since my first day on the job. Ah!\n[glass shatters]\nMr. Shy: [sighs] But why hold onto the past really?\nFluttershy: You can't just fly in and change everything Mom and Dad have built here.\nZephyr Breeze: But this is the only place big enough for my studio/meditation garden. Ooh! Unless I do it in the living room!\nFluttershy: [to her parents] I know speaking up for yourself can be hard, believe me, but Zephyr will never stand on his own if he can lean on you.\nZephyr Breeze: Don't be so dramatic, sis! Mom and Dad just wanna let me be me! Right? I can do plenty on my own.\nFluttershy: I agree. Which is why you should move out.\nZephyr Breeze: Oh. Well... I mean, I-I totally would, but... I don't think that's what Mom and Dad want! It's not, is it?\nMrs. Shy: Ehhh...\nMr. Shy: You know we love you, son, but your sister has a point.\nZephyr Breeze: [tearing up] Sure. I mean, I really just came back here to keep you guys company, but... whatever's best for the family. I just... I just gotta grab a few essentials.\nMrs. Shy: And... y-you definitely have somewhere else to go?\nZephyr Breeze: Of course! There's plenty of ponies who'd love for a little breeze to blow their way...\n\nRainbow Dash: So... where's Zeph gonna go now?\nFluttershy: I'm not sure. Oh, I hope I did the right thing...\nRainbow Dash: Are you kidding? One hundred percent!\nZephyr Breeze: [singsong] Hey, sis!\n[door opens]\nZephyr Breeze: Your new roomie's here!\nRainbow Dash: Okay, maybe like seventy percent.\n\nFluttershy: Um, Zephyr. When Mom and Dad told you to find someplace else to live, I don't think they meant here.\nZephyr Breeze: Well, it's not their house, so by definition, it's someplace else. Am I right, Rainbows? Stop oogling me and help settle this.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] You know what? I totally forgot that I promised to help Pinkie Pie... sprinkle... something.\n[zoom]\nFluttershy: You said you had plenty of places to go!\nZephyr Breeze: Ehhhh...\nFluttershy: [sighs] Fine. You can stay here\u2014\nZephyr Breeze: You're the best! We're gonna have so much fun.\nFluttershy: On one condition.\nZephyr Breeze: Totally. Anything.\nFluttershy: You have to get a job.\nZephyr Breeze: Cracking the whip, huh? You always were kind of bossy.\nFluttershy: [through gritted teeth] Zephyr Breeze...\nZephyr Breeze: Kidding! Get a job. Absolutely.\n[scraping]\n\n[rooster crows]\nZephyr Breeze: [yawns] Where are we goin' so early? You have no idea how bad morning sun is for your mane.\nFluttershy: Remember how we talked about you getting a job?\nZephyr Breeze: It was just yesterday, and it's totally on my to-do list, but you can't expect to find something befitting my awesomeness overnight.\nFluttershy: I thought you might say that.\n[knocking]\n[door opens]\nFluttershy: So I did it for you.\nZephyr Breeze: What?!\n\nRarity: These fabrics all need to be dyed those colors. Do you think you can handle that?\nZephyr Breeze: [muttering] Um, I don't know...\nRarity: You get started while Fluttershy and I head to the store for more supplies. Ta-ta!\nFluttershy: Good luck!\n[door closes]\n[splats]\n\nFluttershy: Thanks for giving my brother a job. I just hope he's up to the task.\nRarity: Oh, darling, dyeing fabric is the simplest thing!\n[door opens]\nRarity: You just dip cloth in a bo\u2014\nFluttershy and Rarity: [gasps]\nZephyr Breeze: [humming to himself] Rarity, you're back!\nFluttershy: What did you do?\nZephyr Breeze: Since you talk to animals all the time, I just figured it runs in the family, so why not outsource this stuff, you know?\n[animals chittering]\nZephyr Breeze: Turns out the animal communication thing isn't genetic.\nRarity: Zephyr, I asked you to do this job! Not to pawn it off on innocent woodland creatures!\nZephyr Breeze: Okay, I guess you have some feelings about this. But you should know it's basically your cat's fault for walking by and giving me the idea. But I'm actually kinda into this look!\nOpalescence: [yowls]\nZephyr Breeze: So I guess what I'm saying is... you're welcome?\nRarity: [frustrated stuttering] Zephyr, this is just unacceptable!\nZephyr Breeze: Wow. I guess I know when my efforts aren't appreciated.\nRarity: Ugghh!\n[door closes]\nFluttershy: [giggles nervously]\n\nZephyr Breeze: Whoa! Those are tall!\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm glad you noticed, because they're your new job.\nZephyr Breeze: Wha? [to Fluttershy] You said you were taking me to tea with the princess!\nFluttershy: Actually, I said I was going to tea with the princess. You're going to work.\nZephyr Breeze: Sis, c'mon!\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't worry, Zephyr, it'll be easy. I just need a Pegasus pony to fly up and wipe each window down from top to bottom.\nSpike: And I'm here to make sure you do it right.\n\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow, Zephyr! This looks amazing!\n[ukulele strumming]\nZephyr Breeze: Uh, you know, like you said, it was easy!\nFluttershy: Where's Spike?\nSpike: Up here!\nTwilight Sparkle: You were supposed to supervise, not do all the work!\nSpike: I was supervising! And then Zephyr asked me about different cleaning techniques and which one was best, and if I could\u2014 Hey! I did all the work!\nZephyr Breeze: Don't let him fool you. Old Spike is quite the taskmaster.\n[zip]\n\nZephyr Breeze: Oh, come on, sis. I had to ask Spike to make sure I was doing it right.\nFluttershy: You didn't do it at all! [inhales] Well, I guarantee there won't be any fooling around on the next job.\nZephyr Breeze: Next job?\n[whoosh]\nRainbow Dash: That's right, Zeph! You're coming with me!\nZephyr Breeze: You don't have to come up with some excuse to hang out with me, Rainbows! Let's just go for a fly and see where the day takes us.\nRainbow Dash: [frustrated sigh] We're going to Wonderbolts Headquarters. And I am gonna give you a job so simple and straightforward, not even you can weasel your way out of it! [quickly] And the second you try, I'm gonna zap you with a storm cloud! Got it?!\nZephyr Breeze: Oh, I got it. I can already feel the electricity between us.\n\n[door opens]\nZephyr Breeze: Rainbow Dash is crazy, okay?! She expects me to do stuff right when she asks me to do it! It's insane!\nFluttershy: So you just quit? Again?\nZephyr Breeze: Escaped is more like it. Besides, what was I supposed to do?\nFluttershy: Keep trying? Finish something for once? Maybe that way, you'd actually find something you like to do!\nZephyr Breeze: That all sounds fine for your friends, but it's just not me.\nFluttershy: Then I'm sorry, Zephyr, but I don't think you can live here.\nZephyr Breeze: Fine! I'll just go live in the woods like my foreponies before me! Guess the only breeze this zephyr can count on is his own!\n\n[sweeping]\nRainbow Dash: Aw, cheer up, Fluttershy. I know it was hard, but you did the right thing. You couldn't let Zephyr pull the same stuff on you that he's always pulled on your folks!\nFluttershy: I guess so...\nConstance: [twittering]\nFluttershy: Oh, hello, Constance!\nConstance: [twittering]\nFluttershy: Oh? Oh, dear.\n\nZephyr Breeze: See, Wigford? The Breeze needs nopony! We've got food, shelter. Just need to put the old kettle on...\n[rocks clinking]\n[beat]\nZephyr Breeze: Come on, sticky-sticky, make with the sparks!\n[clanging]\nZephyr Breeze: Ugh! What's a pony got to do to find a decent stick around here?!\n[whap]\nZephyr Breeze: Ugh. [grunting]\nRainbow Dash: I know he needs to learn to do things for himself, but...\nFluttershy: Oh... I can't let him live like this.\n[crunch]\nRainbow Dash: Actually, I don't think he'd make it through the night.\n[tapping]\n[leaves rustling]\nZephyr Breeze: [gasps] Fluttershy! Hey! I was just, um, cozying up in my sleeping bag! Ready to call it an early night! [mock-tired] Such an exhausting day, y'know?\nRainbow Dash: It's noon.\nZephyr Breeze: You know me! [maracas in background] Siesta...\n[thunk]\nZephyr Breeze: Ugh... I can't do this. I can't do anything.\nFluttershy: Zephyr, you're smart and talented. You could do anything if you just tried!\nZephyr Breeze: And what if I give everything I have and still fail? Honestly, I think it's better not to try at all.\nRainbow Dash: But then you won't ever do anything.\nZephyr Breeze: I don't expect you two to understand. I mean, when have you ever failed? You've literally helped save Equestria, like, a dozen times.\nFluttershy: And I was worried that I'd fail every time! Sometimes you have to do things, even though you might fail.\nZephyr Breeze: But failing is the worst!\nFluttershy: And quitting doesn't feel much better, does it?\nZephyr Breeze: No.\nFluttershy: So here's the deal: You can come back with me, but you have to do exactly what I say. No exceptions.\nZephyr Breeze: [resigned] I will literally do anything you ask me if it means I don't have to stay here.\n\nFluttershy: Okay, you know what you have to do, right?\nZephyr Breeze: Beg for help, then quit when I get frustrated. Just kidding! Total opposite of that. Got it.\n[door opens]\nRainbow Dash: You think he can do it?\n\n[Fluttershy]\nEverypony has times in their lives\nWhen their hearts are filled with doubt\n\nEverypony has times in their lives\nWhen their hearts are filled with doubt\n\n[Zephyr Breeze]\nFrustration builds up inside\nAnd it makes you want to shout\n\nFrustration builds up inside\nAnd it makes you want to shout\n\n[Rainbow Dash]\nBut if you just take that first step\nThe next one will appear\n\nBut if you just take that first step\nThe next one will appear\n\n[Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash]\nAnd you find you can walk, then run\nThen fly...!\nInto the stratosphere\n\nAnd you find you can walk, then run\nThen fly...!\nInto the stratosphere\n\nYou've got to give it your best\nSo you can pass the test\nGive it everything that you've got\n\nYou've got to give it your best\nSo you can pass the test\nGive it everything that you've got\n\nAnd we know you can win\nYou just have to begin\nHave to give it your very best shot\n\nAnd we know you can win\nYou just have to begin\nHave to give it your very best shot\n\n[Zephyr Breeze]\nThere are times when you want to give up\nWhen you think that you can't go on\n\nThere are times when you want to give up\nWhen you think that you can't go on\n\n[Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash]\nBut if you fight through with all of your might\nYou will find that you can't go wrong\nThat you could do it all along\n\nBut if you fight through with all of your might\nYou will find that you can't go wrong\nThat you could do it all along\n\n[Fluttershy]\nEverypony has times in their lives\nWhen their hearts are filled with doubt\n\nEverypony has times in their lives\nWhen their hearts are filled with doubt\n\n[Rainbow Dash]\nBut if you just give it your all\nYou'll start to work it out\n\nBut if you just give it your all\nYou'll start to work it out\n\n[Zephyr Breeze]\nAnd I know I can't give up too soon\nGet myself in the zone\nAnd I find I can walk, then run\n\nAnd I know I can't give up too soon\nGet myself in the zone\nAnd I find I can walk, then run\n\n[Fluttershy, Zephyr, and Rainbow Dash]\nThen fly...!\n\nThen fly...!\n\n[Zephyr Breeze]\nI can do it on my own\n\nI can do it on my own\n\n[Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash]\nYou can do it on your own\n\nYou can do it on your own\n\n[Zephyr Breeze]\nI can do it on my own\nI can do it on my own\nZephyr Breeze: I did it!

I mean, the sky's the limit, right?\n[beat]\nZephyr Breeze: But, y'know...

Is he doing well?\nMr. Shy: I tell you, he's a brand new pony! So full of drive and determination.\nRainbow Dash: Heh. That's great.\n[door opens]\nZephyr Breeze: [singsong] Guess who graduated from mane therapy training?\nRainbow Dash: Hah, awesome!\nMr. Shy: Congratulations, son!\nMrs. Shy: You look so handsome!\nFluttershy: I'm so proud of you, Zephyr.\nZephyr Breeze: It was only a matter of time before they recognized my true genius! But actually doing the work probably helped, and I wouldn't have if it weren't for you.\nFluttershy: Oh, I just gave you some encouragement. You did this on your own.\nZephyr Breeze: And honestly, right now I feel like I can do anything... except find a place. I can still crash here for a few days, right?\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nTwilight Sparkle: As you've all probably noticed, it's been quite some time since the map has sent us on a mission of friendship.\nSpike: Yeah! Ever since Starlight messed with it to go back in time and try to change history!\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes. Since then. But, as part of her studies, Starlight's been assisting me. And together, we think we've come up with a spell that can get it working again!\n[ponies cheering]\nPinkie Pie: [simultaneously] Ooh, well done!\nTwilight Sparkle: Now without further ado...\n[magic sounds]\n[ponies gasping and oohing]\nPinkie Pie: Fluttershy and Twilight in Appleloosa!

I hope it's some faraway place that nopony has gone before!\nRarity: [chuckles nervously] Well, maybe not too far away. An adventure somewhere that has modern conveniences would be preferable. [gasps] Canterlot! This is wonderful! I can check the boutique! Perhaps there'll be some social events that we can attend! [gasps] I'll have to pack extra outfits! What will I wear?!\nPinkie Pie: Y'know, some ponies get excited about the silliest things.\n\n[theme song]\n\nRarity: [sighs] Now then, as far as finding a friendship problem, I suggest we start at the castle and begin to question the proper\u2014\nPinkie Pie: Oh, Rarity, you don't find a friendship problem. It finds you. We just need to go with the flow, and eventually, kablam! We get friendship problem'd right between the eyes.\nRarity: Well, this is a team effort, so if you feel we should go with the flow, then with the flow we shall go. But where's the flow saying we should go?\nPinkie Pie: You know Canterlot. What do you think we should do?\nRarity: Hm. Take your pick. Culture, couture, cuisine!\n[stomach rumbling]\nRarity: Oh, my. Well, it sounds like your stomach is saying we should flow towards some lunch? I know just where to go.\n\nRarity: Restaurant Row, the absolute best place for fine dining in all of Equestria!\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, so many choices! Where should we go? This one? That one? Those ones?\nRarity: Any establishments that have this \u2013 the three-hoof rating.\nPinkie Pie: Um, whose hooves?\nRarity: Why, Zesty Gourmand, the Queen of Cuisine. When it comes to food, she is the ultimate authority in Canterlot and thus all Equestria. She judges a restaurant on cuisine, decor, and presentation. Without her approval, a restaurant simply cannot survive.\nPinkie Pie: What's so important about her approval?\nRarity: Zesty grew up around fine dining, and everypony hangs on her every word when it comes to cuisine.\nPinkie Pie: Wow! Then the food here must be amazing! Lead the way, partner! Whee! [giggles]\n\nRarity: [gasps] Oh, my! Such presentation. Mm. Oh. [smacks lips] Ah. Yes. Very nice...\n[ploink!]\nPinkie Pie: Nom nom nom. [gulps, gags] Maybe, I'm not in the mood for... [whispers] whatever this is. Can we try someplace else?\n\nPinkie Pie: Nom nom. Ugh. Maybe one more stop?\n\nPinkie Pie: Blech! Nope.\n\nPinkie Pie: Maybe instead of trusting somepony else's hooves, I should pick the next place?\nRarity: Ugh! Very well.\nPinkie Pie: [sniffing, gasps]\nRarity: The Tasty Treat. It's very... rustic. [whispers] It looks like it hasn't even been rated.\nPinkie Pie: Thank goodness! Hee-hee!\n[door closes]\n\n[Middle Eastern music plays]\nRarity: Are we sure they're open?\nPinkie Pie: [sniffs deeply] Mmmm. It smells open.\n[clattering]\nSaffron Masala: Oh! Are you here for lunch?\nPinkie Pie: Yes, indeedy!\nSaffron Masala: I'm Saffron Masala, the chef here at The Tasty Treat, the most exotic cuisine in Canterlot. Would you like to hear about the specials?\nRarity: We're actually in a bit of a hur\u2014\nPinkie Pie: Yes, please!\nSaffron Masala: We have a curried oat cake.\nPinkie Pie: We'll take one!\nSaffron Masala: Uh, and a grass sandwich that has been marinated overnight in a mustard Dijon dressing.\nPinkie Pie: How can you say no to that?\nSaffron Masala: A-And for you?\nRarity: Oh, me? Oh, I'm fine. Thank you. [aside, singsong, to Pinkie] No rating.\nPinkie Pie: [sighs]\nCoriander Cumin: [sighs, grumbling in Hindi]\nPinkie Pie: Hiya! What's your name?\nCoriander Cumin: Coriander Cumin.\nPinkie Pie: Are you a chef here too?\nCoriander Cumin: My daughter cooks. I host.\nPinkie Pie: Then why are you stacking chairs?\nCoriander Cumin: Without customers, I have nopony to host for. So I stack!\nSaffron Masala: Father, stop it! Don't close up the restaurant around our guests.\nCoriander Cumin: What does it matter?! When they leave, nopony else will be coming in!\nSaffron Masala: Well, your attitude isn't going to bring anyone in! Can't you at least pretend to be positive?!\nPinkie Pie: [slurps] So good!\nCoriander Cumin: You are doing enough pretending for the both of us. Nopony here wants to try anything new! I know when to throw in the towel!\nRarity: Um, Pinkie, perhaps we should excuse ourselves.\nPinkie Pie: [muffled speaking] Oh, Rarity, try this!\nRarity: [munches] Ooh!\nSaffron Masala: Maybe if you would listen to my ideas for once...\nCoriander Cumin: Oh, yes! I did not move halfway across Equestria for my daughter that I never listen to!\nPinkie Pie: [spits] Rarity, I think that friendship problem just kablammed us right between the eyes!\nRarity: These two? Oh, I don't know, darling. The food is excellent, but I'm not sure there's much you and I can do to help them.\nCoriander Cumin: [scoffs] What would you have me do? We can't even get Zesty Gourmand to come to our restaurant. She took one look at how empty it was and said it wasn't even worth rating!\nRarity: That's it!\nPinkie Pie: Yes! Uh, what's it?\nRarity: The flow has led us here! This is our mission! [to Saffron and Coriander] We are going to get you a three-hoof rating and save your restaurant! I can get Zesty Gourmand here!\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] And I can pack this place with ponies!\nCoriander Cumin: Hmph. And how do you intend to do such a thing?\nPinkie Pie and Rarity: Just leave it to us!\n\nSaffron Masala: Father, will you please stop packing things?!\nCoriander Cumin: When the lovely pony comes back and says she couldn't convince Zesty Gourmand to come visit us, we will need to pack all this up. I am just getting a head start.\nPinkie Pie: You really don't know Rarity.\nRarity: [singsong] I've done it!\nPinkie Pie: See?\nRarity: It took all of my charm and cajoling, but I was able to convince Zesty Gourmand to come and try the food!\nCoriander Cumin: What is the catch?\nRarity: Ah, yes. Well, um, there is a bit of a challenge. The only time she could make herself available is tonight.\nCoriander Cumin: Pfft. Oh, yeah, right.\nSaffron Masala: What is it?\nRarity: Zesty rates a restaurant on cuisine, decor, and presentation, and she has very specific tastes. If she's coming tonight, there is quite a bit of work that needs to get done.\nPinkie Pie: Like what?\nRarity: Oh, a tweak here, a tuck there, some slight modifications to the menu. [laughs nervously] We just need the place to feel more cosmopolitan.\nCoriander Cumin: Pfft.\nSaffron Masala: Father, after Rarity went to all of this trouble for us, can't we at least try?\nRarity: Why don't I stay behind with Coriander to get the restaurant ready for Zesty's arrival? You and Saffron can try and drum up some business.\nPinkie Pie: One packed restaurant, coming right up!\nRarity: Coriander, I understand your trepidation. But I promise you, we will get those hooves by making this place feel just like all of the other restaurants on Restaurant Row!\n\n[door shuts]\nSaffron Masala: [sighs] I hope my father doesn't drive Rarity crazy.\nPinkie Pie: It'll be fine.

I wanted Canterlot to like us for us!\nPinkie Pie: Rarity, how could you ruin the restaurant?!\nRarity: Oh, pff. Kch. Ts! We helped save the restaurant. Now, where are the other guests? How many other ponies are coming?\nPinkie Pie and Saffron Masala: Two.\nRarity: Just two?! I thought you said you could pack the place with ponies no matter what!\nPinkie Pie: You said you would make the restaurant better...\nRarity: [gasps]\nPinkie Pie: ...so I guess we both didn't know what we were talking about!\n[knocking]\nRarity: [gasps] Zesty Gourmand! Everypony, places!\n[door opens]\nRarity: [gulps]\n\nCoriander Cumin: [unenthusiastic] Welcome to The Tasty Treat. What can I get you this evening?\nZesty Gourmand: I hardly think it matters, but by all means, try your best to impress.\nOrange Slice: Well, we'll both try the special this evening. Maybe with a little kick to it, eh? Yeah, we've been craving some food with actual taste.\nCoriander Cumin: Saffron Masala, what are you doing?!\nSaffron Masala: I'm trying to save our reputations! [sips] I've given it at least a little bit of flavor.\nRarity: No-no-n-n-no, but that's not what Zesty wants!\nPinkie Pie: What kind of food expert doesn't want flavor?! That's insane!\n[pouring]\nPinkie Pie: I'm taking this out there!\nRarity: No! Zesty will hate it! You are going to ruin this for them!\nPinkie Pie: No, I'm trying to fix it after you ruined it!\n[thunk]\nPinkie Pie and Rarity: Noooooo!\n[splat]\nZesty Gourmand: I think we are done here.\nRarity: Zesty! Please wait! Allow me to explain!\nZesty Gourmand: Rarity, when it comes to fashion, you are adequate. But take some advice from a friend \u2013 keep your opinions out of restaurants. Substandard food, laughable service, and I would think even you could recognize that the decor here is trying desperately while desperately failing. Recommending a disreputable place such as this could do serious damage to your social standing.\nPinkie Pie: Disreputable?! You mean a place with food that actually tastes good?\nZesty Gourmand: Anypony can throw ingredients together and create an obvious taste that uncultured ponies like those two can register.\nChargrill Breadwinner: Hey!\nZesty Gourmand: But it takes a true culinary artist to create a subtle taste, the barest hint of a sensation. That's what I bring to Canterlot. That's art.\n[door closes]\n\nPinkie Pie: I'm so embarrassed.\nRarity: I don't know that there are words to adequately express how truly sorry we are.\nCoriander Cumin: The worst has happened. No use crying over spilt food now.\nSaffron Masala: Here. This always cheered me up when I was younger.\nCoriander Cumin: [gasps] My spicy flat-noodle soup!\nPinkie Pie, Rarity, and Coriander Cumin: [sipping]\nRarity: Oh, my! This is truly delightful!\nPinkie Pie: Mmm, this is the best thing you've made so far! And I thought the food before was the best!\nSaffron Masala: That's all I've ever wanted to do, father! Make food for the ponies of Canterlot like the food we made together when I was younger!\nCoriander Cumin: It has been so long since we cooked together. Heh. Remember how you used to hide the ingredients you did not like?\nCoriander Cumin and Saffron Masala: [laughing]\nRarity: You know what? Who cares what some stuffy unicorn thinks of the food here? It's exquisite.\nPinkie Pie: That's true.\nRarity: And you don't need three silly hooves in your window to prove it.\nPinkie Pie: That's double true!\nRarity: You just need ponies in here to give it a chance! Ponies that will tell everypony else in Canterlot that The Tasty Treat has the best food in the city!\nPinkie Pie: That's true times three!\nSaffron Masala: But without Zesty's approval, nopony will even try our food!\nRarity: Ohhhh, yes, they will. Pinkie, we are the perfect team for this! We were just doing the wrong jobs! I will go out and bring the crowd! You stay here and make sure this place is every bit as unique and rustic as it was the moment we walked in!\nCoriander Cumin: And? What about us?\nRarity: You two? You are going to cook! Make whatever you want, and make a lot of it! I intend to bring a crowd!\n\n[instrumental of \"It's Gonna Work\" plays]\nRarity: Would the owner of one of the premier boutiques in Canterlot put a stamp of approval on something that wasn't fabulous?\n\nRarity: It's almost time! Is everypony ready for the grand re-re-opening?\nSaffron Masala: Before we open, my father and I just wanted to say... Thank you for all of your help. We've both been so stressed about the restaurant succeeding that we forgot what it was we loved about it in the first place.\nCoriander Cumin: Cooking is something we used to love to do together. No matter what happens next, thank you for reminding us of that.\nPinkie Pie: Oh, you guys! Group hug!\nPinkie Pie and Coriander Cumin: [laughing]\nPinkie Pie: Now come on! We've got a party to throw!\n[door opens]\n[ponies chattering]\nCoriander Cumin: Welcome to The Tasty Treat! Make yourselves comfortable!\n[muffled chattering]\nSaffron Masala: Please, feel free to sample the food!\n[door opens]\nZesty Gourmand: What's this?! What is everypony doing here?! This place has no hooves! It is not in keeping with the level of cuisine that I have set for Canterlot! Nopony told you this place was acceptable!\n\"Sweet Biscuit\": Uh, Rarity and her friend said it was good? They told us!\nZesty Gourmand: They told you? And who are they to tell you anything? Rarity can tell you what hats to wear with which skirts. Her friend can tell you how to maintain a tragic look for a frizzy mane. They can't tell you what food you can eat!\nRarity: No, we can't, and neither can you! Nopony has the right to tell these ponies what to think! Zesty, you have very... specific...\nPinkie Pie: And very strange!\nRarity: Yes, and very strange opinions about food, and that's your right. But just because you like your food a certain way, there is no reason to tell these ponies that they need to do the same!\nBurly Unicorn: Rarity is right! I for one think the food here is delicious! I own The Smoked Oat on Restaurant Row; I hate the food we make! From now on, it's all smoked, basted, and grilled!\nMatronly Pony: This food is an inspiration! I own The Bake Stop. I'm going to bake my mother's bundt cake the way she made it \u2013 full of flavor!\n[crowd chattering and agreeing]\nRarity: Zesty, are you sure you wouldn't like to try the food?

[chuckle]\n\n[camera clicks]\n\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] I am so glad I ran into you. Even though I knew the convention would be totally awesome, it's more fun when you're with someone who really knows Daring Do.\nQuibble Pants: I know what you mean. It's so hard to find a pony who really gets it.\nRainbow Dash: Hm. That's weird. We've only done stuff from the first trilogy. After lunch, we should probably start working our way back through the other books.\nQuibble Pants: Whoa, whoa, whoa. There are no other books.\nRainbow Dash: Of course there are. Daring Do and the Trek of the Terrifying Towers, Daring Do and the Many Faces of\u2014\nQuibble Pants: Uh, p-please, please don't. Just don't even mention the titles. I-I'm not saying those books don't exist. I'm saying that I refuse to acknowledge them.\nRainbow Dash: Why?\nQuibble Pants: 'Cause they're horrible! I mean, there isn't a single thing after Ring of Destiny that is even remotely in the realm of the possible!\nRainbow Dash: What?! I know for a fact that everything in every one of those books is one hundred percent possible!\nQuibble Pants: Uh, and how could you possibly know that?\nRainbow Dash: Gyuh, uh, I just... do!\nQuibble Pants: Well, that's a compelling argument.\nRainbow Dash: Why would you even come to this convention if you hate Daring Do so much?\nQuibble Pants: I don't hate Daring Do. The first series was smart and cool and an amazing nod to old-time serialized adventure books, that somehow manages to be self-reflective and ironic while at the same time celebrating the art form without a hint of cynicism. Which is why I came here to ask A. K. Yearling muzzle-to-muzzle why she sold out and dumbed down the rest of her books into just a series of impossible action sequences!\nRainbow Dash: Okay, now I know you're crazy. A. K. Yearling is awesome, and every Daring Do book that comes out is better than the last!\nQuibble Pants: Wha... Wow. Okay, yeah, I-I-I'm sorry, but I could never be friends with somepony who's willing to believe impossible stuff is possible as long as Daring Do does it.\nRainbow Dash: That's okay, because I could never be friends with somepony who's so focused on things being possible that he's willing to turn his back on the coolest hero of all time!\nQuibble Pants: Fine!\nRainbow Dash: Fine!\n\nRainbow Dash: Look, just tell A.

Where are you going?\n[door opens]\nQuibble Pants: And we're out here because...?\nRainbow Dash: Daring Do told me that Caballeron came to this convention to steal the Amulet of Culiacan, and I just saw him and his henchponies come this way!\nQuibble Pants: Okay. I'm gonna head back inside. There's just a little too much crazy out here for the both of us.\n[fwump]\nRainbow Dash: [gasps]\n[fwump]\n\nDr. Caballeron: I do not know what Daring Do is playing at, but if she told you two fanponies of my plan to steal the amulet, you must work for her.\nRainbow Dash: Caballeron! Hah! What do you have to say now, Quibble?\nQuibble Pants: This was your plan to prove the Daring Do books are realistic? You bought a Daring Do Experience Adventu-cation, really?\nRainbow Dash: What?! No! Look around us! Henchponies, Caballeron, the jungle it took forever to get to? This is the real deal!\nQuibble Pants: Right. We're actually being held captive by Caballeron. Please! This guy's accent is all over the place! No offense.\nDr. Caballeron: I...\nQuibble Pants: So what's the setup here? You've... kidnapped us, and taken us to the middle of nowhere because...?\nDr. Caballeron: The Temple of Chicomoztoc is somewhere in this jungle. When I find it, the Seven-Sided Chest is as good as mine! I just need the Amulet of Culiacan to unlock it.\nQuibble Pants: Uh-huh, and Daring Do has the amulet so you came up with this over-complicated plot to lure her into the jungle and exchange it for us.\nDr. Caballeron: I wouldn't call it over-complicated, but... yes.\nQuibble Pants: Okay, we're done here. Great work. Seriously, very believable.\n[smacking]\nQuibble Pants: [grunts] Listen, pal, you can keep her money, but I'm not\u2014\nDr. Caballeron: Going anywhere! You may not approve of my plan, but I'm the mastermind here!\nQuibble Pants: [aside] Debatable...\nDr. Caballeron: And I say you will remain here until Daring Do comes to rescue you. And if she wants you back in one piece, she will give me the amulet! Tie them up!\n[chains clinking]\nRainbow Dash: The Griffon's Lock!\nDr. Caballeron: You know of it?

We'll never solve the Griffon's Lock before they get back.\n[click]\n[chains clinking]\nRainbow Dash: Okay, that was pretty good. Quick, we've gotta get out of here and warn Daring Do!\nQuibble Pants: No way. Just point me to the hotel and you can play fanpony and hunt treasure out here all day long.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Fine. Let's just say this is a Daring Do Adventucation. The only way to get back to the convention is to go through it. So just follow me, and I'll lead you out. Deal?\nQuibble Pants: I... [groans] Fine.\nRainbow Dash: [under her breath] Maybe if I just leave you in the jungle, it'll convince you.\n\nQuibble Pants: ...which would make Daring Do left-hoofed, which we know is false, and that is everything that's wrong with Daring Do and the Trek to the Terrifying Tower.

If you read that in a book, you might even think it was unrealistic.\nQuibble Pants: Okay, I'll give you that one. I mean we could have been done for. [beat] We could have been done for! W-What kind of Adventu-cation is this?! I mean, that's just, that's just bad business! What, what are these ponies thinking?!\nDr. Caballeron: Right now? We are thinking that we should thank you for escaping. For you have led us directly to the Lost Temple of Chicomoztoc! [laughing]\n\nDr. Caballeron: Make sure they are secure this time! We can't have them escaping again.\nRainbow Dash: [straining] You'll never get away with this!\nDr. Caballeron: Won't I? You've led me to the temple, and Daring Do is too noble to let harm befall her companions, so the amulet is as good as mine. What? No witty remarks this time about how silly my plan is?\nQuibble Pants: This isn't the official Daring Do Experience Adventu-cation, is it.\nRainbow Dash: Finally!\nQuibble Pants: It's some cheap knockoff run by a bunch of incompetent ponies that have no idea how to execute this adventure with any level of safety!\nRainbow Dash: Ugh!\nQuibble Pants: What was that with the bridge?! We were in serious danger! I-I'm reporting you all to... well, I don't know who I'm reporting you to, but it's gonna be somepony important!

How can you\u2014?!\nQuibble Pants: Wait, hold on. Before we get in another fight, I-I think I finally figured it out! I love the Daring Do that solves puzzles and uses her brain to get out of tough situations, and she did way more of that in the original trilogy! You love the Daring Do that is brave and awesome and comes out on top no matter what the odds!\nRainbow Dash: Okay...?\nQuibble Pants: And that's okay! We might never agree on what makes Daring Do cool, but you... are definitely cool. I-I mean, the way you saved me on the bridge? Wow! And escaping from the temple... you, Rainbow Dash, are awesome.\nRainbow Dash: Well... I-I'm not the one who can locate a treasure in half the time Daring Do can! You may have terrible taste in books, but you're pretty awesome yourself. In a brainy, egghead, puzzle-solving kind of way. Heh.\nQuibble Pants: I guess we don't have to agree on everything to get along. Friends?\nRainbow Dash: Definitely friends.\nQuibble Pants: Uh, do you think A. K.

I mean, for instance, in the second adventure...\n[Quibble continues talking over credits]\nQuibble Pants: ...there's a side character. I don't want to kind of name it right now, because it's sort of this thing that I've already written a lot of fan fiction on. I don't want you to... Not that I'm saying that you would steal it! But I am saying this would totally go along my whole thing about puzzle-solving, except what if each puzzle that was solved, uh, unlocked a new karate move? Think of it that way, right?

You've got a lot of work to do before you're ready to race.\nSnips: Yeah, but... not schoolwork, right?\nCheerilee: There'll be a block of applewood just like this one waiting for you at Sweet Apple Acres tomorrow, and you've got one day to turn it into a race-ready cart.\n[students groaning]\nScootaloo: Oh, yeah... That is a lot of work.\nCheerilee: Mm-hmm. Luckily, you'll each get to pick an older pony to help you! But choose wisely, because they'll also have to ride in the cart with you during the race.\nScootaloo: Hmmm... I think I know just the pony to ask.\nSweetie Belle: Me too!\nApple Bloom: Me three!\nCheerilee: Just remember, everypony. Your cart has to be able to finish the race if you want to win one of the awards. Fastest \u2013 for winning the race, naturally. Most traditional \u2013 for the best working replica of an original Applewood cart. And most creative \u2013 for the cart with the best overall design.\nApple Bloom: [dreamily] Hoo-wee! Those ribbons are the bees' knees.\nStudents: [dreamily] Uh-huh...\nCheerilee: All right then, class! You've got a lot to learn if you want to build a race cart.\n[students groaning]\nSnips: Aww... I knew there was gonna be a catch!\n\nSweetie Belle: Wow! Have you seen what the carts used to look like in the olden days?\nApple Bloom: Yeah, I know all about them. When Ponyville started the Derby, they decided to use the wood from our apple trees for the carts. The race has been a part of Sweet Apple Acres ever since.\nSweetie Belle: I just think these old carts look so cool! But I guess you and Applejack will probably win the award for the most traditional, huh?\nApple Bloom: The Apples usually do, but honestly, I'd rather build the fastest cart there is and win the race!\n[wings buzzing]\nApple Bloom: But... I'm pretty sure Scoot and Rainbow Dash'll take that award.\nScootaloo: You know, I race around so much on my scooter, being the fastest isn't such a big deal. Maybe I'll try to make the wildest looking cart I can think of!\nApple Bloom: Really?\nScootaloo: Sure! If I win most creative, you can totally win the award for fastest!\nSweetie Belle: And I can win the award for most traditional!\nApple Bloom: Sounds like we're all gonna try somethin' different. I can't wait to tell Applejack!\nScootaloo: Let's get to it!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Go, Crusaders!\n\nRainbow Dash: Are you kidding?! Of course I'll help with the Applewood Derby! I want you to have as much fun as I did when I was a filly!\nScootaloo: Wait, Cloudsdale has a derby too?\nRainbow Dash: Sure! Practically every town in Equestria has one! [sighs] I still remember racing my cloud cart...\n\nYoung Rainbow Dash: This is so awesome! Woo-hoooooo!\n\nScootaloo: And lemme guess. You won fastest cart.\nRainbow Dash: Heh, obviously!\nScootaloo: So what do you say? Will you help me make my race cart?\nRainbow Dash: Help you? I'm all over it! I've got tons of ideas.\nScootaloo: Don't worry, I've got a lot of\u2014 Whoa. Ideas of my own. Um...\n[vase breaks]\nScootaloo: What are you looking for?\nRainbow Dash: The blueprint for my derby cart, of course! I'll have to change it a little, 'cause this race is on roads, not on clouds. But trust me, your cart is gonna be amazing!\n[thudding]\nScootaloo: Um, okay, Rainbow Dash, thanks! How awesome is this? With Dash on my team, how could anything go wrong?\n\nApplejack: Well, I'm mighty flattered you wanna work with your big sis on your cart. I mean, the Applewood Derby did\u2014\nApple Bloom: \u2014start on our farm. I know.\nApplejack: Well, I couldn't be more proud to help my little sister take the prize for most traditional.\nApple Bloom: Actually, I was kinda thinking of somethin' else. Like... fastest?\nApplejack: [scoffs] Fastest? Apple Bloom, things aren't like they were in the old days. The fastest cart now has gotta be slick and modern and\u2014\nApple Bloom: Exactly!\nApplejack: Not Apple at all. The Apples win most traditional. We have since the Derby started! Why would anypony want to win anythin' else? Now why don't you head off and get some chamomile vines, some hickory sticks, and some apple barrels, and I'll show you what an Apple family cart should look like!\nApple Bloom: I guess I do have a family tradition to uphold...\n\nRarity: [gasps] The Applewood Derby?! [excited giggling] Of course I'll help!\nSweetie Belle: Wow. Uh, Rarity, I didn't know you'd be this excited.\nRarity: Me? Oh, why, I'm just itching to right an old wrong from long, long ago!\n\nRarity: [narrating] I designed my own cart when I was just a filly, and I was positive I was going to win the prize for most creative, hooves down! But I came in second. Second!\n\nSweetie Belle: You? Second in most creative? To whom?!\n\n[ponies cheering]\n[lightning cracks]\nRarity: [narrating] But I learned a valuable lesson.\n\nRarity: I learned to know my audience, and the race cart audience wants big! They want bold!\n[door opens]\nRarity: Chop chop! Everypony out!\nUpper class ponies: [indignant chattering]\nRarity: We've got work to do!\n[door closes]\nRarity: This will take all of my considerable skills... [humming to self]\n[scribbling]\nRarity: ...but I will fashion the biggest and boldest Derby cart to ever win the prize for most creative!\nSweetie Belle: Actually, I was sorta thinking of something more... traditional?\nRarity: Oh! [tittering] Please, darling, leave tradition to the Apples. We're doing big, we're doing bold! [humming to self] Soon the prize for most creative will finally be in my hooves!\nSweetie Belle: You mean my hooves.\nRarity: Yes, that's what I said \u2013 my hooves. Darling, I hope you're ready to get an early start tomorrow!\nSweetie Belle: Uh... how early?\n\n[birds twittering]\n[cart rattling]\nSweetie Belle: [yawns] [groans] Rarity, the sun's not even up yet.\nApplejack: Oh, apples, quit complainin'! In my day, we were up even earlier!\nRainbow Dash: Hey, I'd get up in the middle of the night if it means my cart crosses that finish line first and wins fastest!\nRarity: And my cart wins most creative!\nApplejack: And my cart wins most traditional! Hoo-wee, it's gonna be a good day!\nScootaloo: You mean our carts, right?\nRarity: Yes, that's what we said, darling.\nApplejack: Yup.\nRainbow Dash: Our carts.\n\nApple Bloom: Their carts? It almost sounds like they're planning on building them without us.\nSweetie Belle: I'm sure they meant \"our\" carts. Like, the team cart, right?\nScootaloo: Of course! I mean, they're all our older sisters. Practically. Plus, they've all done this before. I'm sure they know best. Let's just buckle down and get to work!\n[carts rattling]\n\n[chattering and handiwork noises]\nScootaloo: [straining]\nRainbow Dash: Scootaloo, where have you been? I've only got 'til noon to make the fastest cart ever!\nScootaloo: Uh, about that. I was really thinking of going for the most creative prize. I mean, I know all about speed already, so...\nRainbow Dash: Exactly! It's all about speed! You've gotta get across the finish line to win a prize, so we might as well get there first, right? Hey, I left a bunch of paint cans by the road. Bring them up here, would ya? Nothing as fun as painting racing stripes on the winning cart!\n[sawing]\nScootaloo: [sighs] Right... Fun...\n\nApple Bloom: Spendin' time buildin' a cart with my big sister? Why, this is just tee-riffic! Um... how can I help?\nApplejack: You can feast your eyes on... this! I-I mean, it ain't quite finished yet.\nApple Bloom: Oh, good.\nApplejack: But don't it have the makin's of the best cart you ever did see? Uh... is somethin' wrong, Apple Bloom?\nApple Bloom: Actually, I was kinda thinkin' of somethin' a little more modern. And less rickety. With maybe a chance of winning?\nApplejack: Bless my hooves, I thought we covered this! Tradition is all that counts! And who knows tradition better than Apples? Nopony, that's who! So are you an Apple, or are you an Apple? [snorts]\nApple Bloom: I'm an Apple, but... what if I just take off this fringe?\n[crunch]\nApplejack: No, not the fringe!\n[crash]\nApplejack: Ugh! Why, shoot! Now I've gotta start all over from scratch, and it's almost race time!\nApple Bloom: Oh. So, maybe we can redesign it then? Just a little.\nApplejack: No time! And who'd want to redesign somethin' that's already perfect?\nApple Bloom: Right... Perfect...\n\nSweetie Belle: Okay, so I sketched out some of my ideas.\n[sound of wrenching]\nSweetie Belle: How about a nice yellow fringe on top?\nRarity: [muffled] Oh-ho-ho-ho, darling, [normal] the fringe is not exactly big! And that yellow is the least bold color I can imagine!\nSweetie Belle: Well, it doesn't have to be yellow. But I really do love the old-timey style. Like this.\nRarity: Sweetie Belle, precious face, \"old-timey\" is just another word for pass\u00e9. Remember, big and bold! I do have a reputation to uphold! It was one thing to lose as a filly, but can you imagine if I didn't win the most creative now? Ponies might stop buying my couture!\nSweetie Belle: But we're supposed to be doing this together!\nRarity: Yes, of course we are, darling. In fact, we just finished. Voila! I know. You're speechless. Well, if that isn't big and bold, I don't know what is! Isn't it wonderful? [humming to self]\nSweetie Belle: [sighs] Right... Wonderful...\n\n[montage music]\n\n[ponies chattering]\nApple Bloom: [tired] Hey, Crusader... How's it goin'?\nSweetie Belle: [sighs] Rarity's definitely made the biggest, boldest cart anypony's ever seen.\nApple Bloom: Wow. Well, Applejack's built somethin' so traditional, it's practically an antique.\nScootaloo: [sighs] No matter what I say, there's no talking Rainbow Dash out of making the fastest cart in Equestria.\nSweetie Belle: Doesn't look like any of us ended up with what we wanted.\nApple Bloom: But... I'm sure our older sisters know what they're doin'. Right?\nScootaloo: Right...\nSweetie Belle: Right.\nApple Bloom: And even if our carts aren't exactly what we had in mind, it'll still be fun to drive them to the finish line.\nSweetie Belle: Sure! The race is the best part!\nApple Bloom: Yeah! CMCs behind the wheels!\nScootaloo and Sweetie Belle: [cheering]\nCheerilee: Derby racers to the starting line! Derby racers to the starting line!\nRainbow Dash: The race is about to start, Scootaloo! You better shake a leg if you wanna ride in the winning cart!\nRarity: You, too, Sweetie Belle. There's only one seat left aboard this creative masterpiece, and it's just for you. Woo-hoo!\nApplejack: Whoa, ponies! Wait for me! This traditional cart handles at the exact perfect pace \u2013 slow! And I got the passenger seat all warmed up for ya, Apple Bloom!\nApple Bloom: Passenger seat?!\n\n[carts rolling]\nScootaloo: [grunts] They're the only older ponies driving!\nSweetie Belle: First they built the carts, now they're gonna drive them?!\nApple Bloom: I know they were all excited to help, but I don't think they're really helping anymore.\nScootaloo: We better hurry if we wanna be a part of this race at all!\n\nCheerilee: Um, aren't you all missing somepony?\nApplejack: They'll be along.\nCheerilee: And, uh, [hushed] usually the younger ponies drive the carts.\nRarity: [chuckles] Darling, do these look like usual carts to you?\n[seat belts clicking]\nCheerilee: [blows fanfare] Racers! On your marks, get set, go!\nSweetie Belle: [screams]\nScootaloo: [screams]\nApple Bloom: [scream turns into a grunt] Can't we go any faster?!\nApplejack: Faster? Don't be silly. This is perfect!\nApple Bloom: [groans]\n[carts rolling]\n\n[Ponies]\nGo, go, go!\n\nGo, go, go!\n\n[Applejack]\nCheck me out, racin' the Derby\nCheck out my old-fashioned cart\n\nCheck me out, racin' the Derby\nCheck out my old-fashioned cart\n\n[Rarity]\nCheck me out, racing the Derby\nIn my original work of art\n\nCheck me out, racing the Derby\nIn my original work of art\n\n[Rainbow Dash]\nCheck me out, faster than ever\nThere's nopony can catch me now\n\nCheck me out, faster than ever\nThere's nopony can catch me now\n\n[Cutie Mark Crusaders]\nLet me out, I'd do it over\nIf I only knew how!\n\nLet me out, I'd do it over\nIf I only knew how!\n\n[Ponies]\nGiddyup, derby racers\nGiddyup, derby racers\nGiddyup, derby racers\nGo, go, go!\n\nGiddyup, derby racers\nGiddyup, derby racers\nGiddyup, derby racers\nGo, go, go!\n\n[Rarity]\nMy cart's the most original\nDesigned with imagination\n\nMy cart's the most original\nDesigned with imagination\n\n[Applejack]\nMy cart's the most traditional\nJust plain, no complications\n\nMy cart's the most traditional\nJust plain, no complications\n\n[Rainbow Dash]\nLook at me, I am the ace\nMight as well give up the chase\n\nLook at me, I am the ace\nMight as well give up the chase\n\n[Cutie Mark Crusaders]\nWish we could stop this race\nStart again and do it our way\n\nWish we could stop this race\nStart again and do it our way\n\nScootaloo: Having any fun yet?\nApple Bloom: Nope!

Now you've ruined it for everypony!\nRarity: Mmmh...\n[crunch]\nRarity: Yes, well, I suppose we might have gotten a teensy bit carried away...\nApplejack: But I thought you all wanted our help.\nApple Bloom: We did! We wanted your help to build our carts. But we all ended up with carts that are what each of you wanted!\nScootaloo and Sweetie Belle: Mm-hmm.\nRainbow Dash: But why didn't you say anything?\nScootaloo: You've all done the race before. I just figured you knew best!\nSweetie Belle: Plus it's hard to speak up to older ponies.\nRarity: Oh, I certainly understand that. But you mustn't think older ponies automatically know best.\nRainbow Dash: And we probably could have done a better job of listening to you.\nApplejack: Oof. I guess we owe all three of you an apology.\nApple Bloom: Maybe not just us.\nRainbow Dash: [nervous laugh] Um, how do you feel about a do-over?\nCheerilee: I think that's a wonderful idea! But maybe the older ponies should sit this one out.\n\nScootaloo: Thanks for helping us fix up our carts. Pretty creative, right?\n\nApple Bloom: I know it's not traditional, but it sure looks fast, don't it?\n\nRarity: You know, darling, I can't believe I'm saying this, but that yellow fringe is rather bold after all.\nSweetie Belle: Thanks, everypony. We couldn't have done it without you.\n[carts rolling]\nApplejack: Yup, I sure am glad Miss Cheerilee agreed to run the race over again.\n\nCheerilee: Well, it isn't every year I get to say this twice, but... Derby racers to the starting line! Derby racers to the starting line! Racers! On your marks, get set... go!\n[foals cheering]\nRainbow Dash: And it's probably best keeping all the grown-ups on the sidelines. But... what are we supposed to do now?\nRarity: I think I have an idea.\n\nRarity: [sipping through straw] Ahhh! Much better! Honestly, I'm not sure why we wanted to race those carts in the first place.\nRainbow Dash: Seriously! [sighs] This is the most relaxed I've been all day.\n[spectators cheering]\n[carts rolling]\nRainbow Dash: Go, Scootaloo, go! Woo-woo-woo-woo! Uhh, I mean... [nervous laugh] This is the life. Right, ponies? [sighs]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[nighttime noises]\nFluttershy: I'm so sorry I lost track of time at our picnic.

Your heart gets all racy, your hooves get all tingly, your mouth gets all dry-ie! Actually, I don't like that part. But the rest is great!\nRainbow Dash: See? Everypony likes a good prank! They're just jokes!\nRarity: Now, Rainbow Dash, I don't think Fluttershy would have called us all here to talk about this if she thought it was funny. Everypony has things they like and things they don't.\nApplejack: And scarin' Fluttershy is just lazy.\nRainbow Dash: [scoffs] Lazy?!\nTwilight Sparkle: A prank isn't very good if you're the only pony laughing.\nPinkie Pie: But what if it's really, really, really, really, really funny?\nRainbow Dash: And I can do funny.\nTwilight Sparkle: I know you can. I guess the trick is making sure that your idea of funny matches the pony you're pranking.\nRainbow Dash: [stifling giggle]\nTwilight Sparkle: That way\u2014\n[prolonged fart noise]\nRainbow Dash: [laughs]\nPinkie Pie: [stifling laugh]\nRainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie: [laughing]\nPinkie Pie: Good one, Rainbow! Ha-ha! You have to admit! That was funny!\nTwilight Sparkle: Not really.\nApplejack: Yeah. A whoopee cushion is like a joke shortcut.\nRainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie: What?!\nRarity: Honestly, Rainbow Dash, if you are not willing to put forth the effort required to pull a prank that everypony can enjoy, you may as well not pull one at all.\nRainbow Dash: Fine! If you ponies want effort, then that's just what you'll get.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm not sure she understood what we meant.\n\nRarity: I know you're excited about the Filly Guide Cookie Drive, but I still have to do a few finishing touches on your uniform.\n[beat]\nSweetie Belle: [lips smacking] Hmm. Not bad.\nRarity: Huh. [reading] \"You asked for it.\"\nSweetie Belle: What does it mean?\nRarity: Hmm. I assume this is Dash's idea of a prank, which can only mean she's rigged some kind of booby trap to your Filly Guide uniform up there.\nSweetie Belle: So how do we get it down?\nRarity: We don't. If Dash thinks I'm going to fall for whatever she's got in mind, she's got another thing coming. There's more uniforms where that one came from!\n[splat]\nSweetie Belle: Hmm.

[giggling]\n\nPinkie Pie: They got me good.\nApplejack: Well, she needs to stop.\nPinkie Pie: Stop? But pranks are so much fun!\nTwilight Sparkle: Not for everypony. And it doesn't seem like Dash is taking the time to find out who enjoys them and who doesn't.\nAll but Twilight: [grumble]\nRarity: Uh, since you and Dash share such an, uh, affinity for pranking, we thought you might be able to get her to, um, uh... quit it!\n\nPinkie Pie: Hey, Rainbow Dash! I have something very important to tell you!\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie, hey! I actually have something totally important to tell you!\nPinkie Pie: You do? Ooh! You go first!\nRainbow Dash: Okay, you know how I've been pranking everypony?\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! [giggles] It's been pretty funny! I-I-I mean, actually, that's what I have to talk to you about.\nRainbow Dash: Here. Have a cookie.\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! Thanks! [chomps]\nRainbow Dash: So, I got to thinking \u2013 why waste my time pranking everypony one at a time when I could prank everypony at once?\nPinkie Pie: Mmm, wow! Everypony at once?! That sounds amazing!\n[record needle scratches]\nPinkie Pie: Gah, wait! I mean, it's not.\nRainbow Dash: You don't even know what it is yet! Pinkie, this is gonna be the best prank ever! I special ordered these joke cookies so the colors would match my mane.\nPinkie Pie: And?\nRainbow Dash: And I'm gonna switch them with the Filly Guide cookies. When Scootaloo and her friends sell them, everypony in town's gonna get a rainbow mouth courtesy of Rainbow Dash! Ha-ha! It's gonna be so awesome!\nPinkie Pie: Uh, I don't know. I mean, it doesn't really seem all that funny.\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] What?!\nPinkie Pie: Maybe this is a good time to stop pranking for a while. The other ponies in town really\u2014\nRainbow Dash: Stop?! No way! This prank is happening, Pinkie! And it's gonna be hilarious!\nPinkie Pie: [chomps]\n\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie, what's the deal? I told you I needed your help switching out all the Filly Guide cookies for the joke cookies. But when you didn't show, I had to do it all by myself! Uh, Pinkie?\nPinkie Pie: [coughs]\nRainbow Dash: [chuckles] Wow. Your face is still pretty rainbowed.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah, I haven't really [coughs] been feeling well. And these joke cookies are the only thing that makes me feel better. You don't have any more, do you?!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, no. I just told you, I used them all for the prank.\nPinkie Pie: Oh.\nRainbow Dash: Pretty soon, the CMCs will start selling them to everypony in town. Ponies will open their boxes and start eating, then all of their teeth will turn rainbow-colored, and they'll know it was me! It's gonna be so awesome! C'mon, you don't wanna miss it!\nPinkie Pie: Actually... [coughs] I don't think I can even... stand... up... [raspy] Unless you've got more cookies!\nRainbow Dash: Aah! On second thought, maybe you better stay here and rest.\nPinkie Pie: [sighs] Yeah. You're right. Sorry to miss out. I'm sure it's gonna be hilarious.\n\nRainbow Dash: All right, who's ready to sell some cookies?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Me!\nApplejack: Look here, Rainbow Dash. I know you promised Scootaloo you'd help out, but I don't want none of your pranks ruinin' these fillies' night.\nRainbow Dash: Look, I'll be with you the whole night so you can totally keep an eye on me.\nApple Bloom: Come on, Applejack! Let's get started!\nScootaloo: Yeah! We've got a lot of ground to cover!\nSweetie Belle: We wanna hit every house in Ponyville!\nRainbow Dash: Come on! You heard her! Every house in Ponyville!

They're probably all in a cookie coma right now.\nRainbow Dash: Huh... Maybe you're right. I'll go check.\n\nRainbow Dash: What is going on...? Okay. Definite cookie-eating happening. But... where is everypony? They must have seen their rainbow mouths by now... They should all be running out into the streets!

We gotta get outta here!\nApplejack: What in tarnation are you goin' on about?\nRainbow Dash: There's no time! You have to follow me!\nRarity: Oh, Rainbow Dash, if you want all of those cookies, you will have to buy them, just like everypony else.\nRainbow Dash: I don't want the cookies\u2014!\n[ponies groaning]\nRainbow Dash: But they do!\nRarity: Wh-wh-what...

That's ridiculous! Filly Guide cookies haven't changed for years! It's not like there's a new ingredient that's turnin' the whole town into cookie-cravin' zombies.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, unless there... is...\nRarity: What are you saying?\nApplejack: What did you do?\n[crunch]\nZombie ponies: [droning] Coooooookiiiiiiiieeeee... coooooookiiiiiiieeee....\n[door rattling]\nRainbow Dash: Cover the windows!\nZombie ponies: Coooook...\n[pounding on door]\nZombie ponies: [droning] Cooooooookieeeee..... cooookiiiiieeeeeeee... [etc.]\nRainbow Dash: [pants] Okay! So I may have switched all the Filly Guide cookies for joke cookies that were supposed to make ponies' mouths rainbow but somehow turned everypony into mindless cookie-eating zombies instead! I figure we just hide out here until the effects wear off, and as long as nopony else eats the cookies, we'll be fine.\nRarity: That's lovely, darling, except for one thing... [droning] We've already eaten theeeeeeeeeemmmmm...\nApplejack: [droning] Looks like your prank up and backfiiiirrrrreeeeed...\nRainbow Dash: [screams]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [droning] Cooooooookiiiieeeees...\n[thud]\nRainbow Dash: [gasps]\n[crunch]\n[zombie ponies groaning]\nRainbow Dash: No, no! Stay away! They're making you sick! You don't want these!\nPinkie Pie: [droning] But we dooooooo... We want cookiiiiiiiieeeeeeees...!\nRainbow Dash: Nngh! Please! Stop! I never meant for this to happen! It was just a harmless prank! It was supposed to be funny! But this isn't funny at all!\nPinkie Pie: [normal] Exactly!\n[splats]\nRainbow Dash: What? Wait... What's happening?\nRarity: Just delighting in pranking the prankster.\nApplejack: [chuckles] Yeah. How does it feel to get some of your own medicine?\nRainbow Dash: So... you're... not sick? None of you are?\nPinkie Pie: Of course not, silly!\nCrowd: Gotcha!\nRainbow Dash: This... was all... a prank?!\nApplejack: Yep! And you can thank Pinkie Pie. After you told her about your plan to prank the whole town, she got everypony together and came up with a way to turn the tables on you.\nPinkie Pie: Aw, shucks, it was nothing! Just a little something I threw together.\nRainbow Dash: Uh...\nScootaloo: Wow! You should see your face!\nApple Bloom: [laughs] Talk about funny!\nRainbow Dash: [scoffs] Well, I don't think it's very funny! And I'm the one that got pranked! I was really scared! I thought I made everypony sick! You can't just go around\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: \u2014pranking whoever you feel like?\nFluttershy: Without thinking about how it might make them feel?\nRarity: Or if they'd even enjoy it?\nApplejack: Or think it's funny?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! [beat] Ohhh. I see what you did there.\nPinkie Pie: Pranks can be a lot of fun when everypony has a good time. I thought you just needed to see what it's like when they don't.\nRainbow Dash: I guess I did. I'm sorry, everypony. I haven't really been thinking about how other ponies feel.\nFluttershy: Well, I hope you learned your lesson.\nRainbow Dash: Totally! You ponies pulled off an amazing prank! I'll have to work extra hard to top it!\n[crickets chirping]\nRainbow Dash: Gotcha.\n[everypony laughing]\n\n[horror film style music over credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[train puffing]\nTwilight Sparkle: I hope Shining Armor and Princess Cadance don't think it's too soon for me to come back to the Crystal Empire for a visit. But I just know Flurry Heart's grown so much already. I wonder if I'll even recognize her.\nStarlight Glimmer: She's the only baby they have, Twilight. I think it'll be pretty easy to figure out who she is.\nTwilight Sparkle: [annoyed grunt]\nStarlight Glimmer: Sorry. I know you want to visit your niece as much as possible, and I'm excited to see Sunburst again. I just don't wanna fall behind on my friendship lessons back home.\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight, your work in Ponyville isn't going anywhere. Besides, I think we all know you can learn about friendship anywhere. Right, Spike?\nSpike: [deep voice] \"Spike?\" Who's \"Spike\"?\nStarlight Glimmer: Pfft. Uh, you're Spike, Spike. And why are you dressed like that?\nSpike: [groans] [normal voice] Guys, you're blowing my cover! How'd you even know it was me?\nStarlight Glimmer: Because you're you... in a coat, hat and glasses. Also, we're the only ones here.\nSpike: Right.\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, why do you need a disguise?\nSpike: Last time we came to the Crystal Empire, there was a lot goin' on with the new baby and the Crystalling, but I still got mobbed in the street.\nStarlight Glimmer: I wouldn't say mobbed.\nSpike: And this is just a family visit. I wouldn't want the presence of Spike the Brave and Glorious to turn it into some kind of circus.\nStarlight Glimmer: We get it. The Crystal Ponies adore you.\nTwilight Sparkle: He did save the Empire. Twice. But still, I don't think your presence will turn our visit into a circus.\nSpike: Not if I find the right disguise, it won't.\n\n[theme song]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, disguise or not, Spike, I don't think you need to worry about being mobbed. Nopony's here.\n[wind whistling]\n[tumbleweed drifting]\n[bird cries]\nSpike: It's like a ghost town.\nTwilight Sparkle: I've got a bad feeling about this.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Yeah, this is weird.\nSpike: I guess I don't need the disguise after all.\n[Crystal Ponies cheering]\nHoneysparkle: It's Spike the Brave and Glorious!\nSapphire Joy: He's come to save us yet again!\nCrystal Ponies: Spike! Spike! Spike! Spike!\nSpike: Save you from what?\nStarlight Glimmer: Yeah, what's going on?\nTwilight Sparkle: Why was everypony hiding?\n\"Amber Laurel\": Oh, it sure looks like Princess Twilight and her pupil.\n\"Scarlet Heart\": But how can we be sure?\n\"Golden V\u00e4s\": We can't! Either one of them could be the... you know!\n[zip!]\n\"Amber Laurel\": [gasps] What if this... [gasps] isn't... [gasps] the real Spike?!\n\"Scarlet Heart\": Everypony, run!\n[zip!]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay. Something strange is definitely going on.\nSpike: [groans] Ya think?\n\nRoyal guard 1: Who goes there?\nStarlight Glimmer: Um, you don't recognize the Princess of Friendship?\nRoyal guard 1: Of course we recognize her.\nRoyal guard 2: But that doesn't mean it's really her.\nSpike: It's okay, guys. They're with me. And any friend of Spike the Brave and Glorious is a friend of the Crystal Empire, am I right?\nRoyal guard 2: Huh. It does look like him.\nRoyal guard 1: Well, it would, wouldn't it? I'm sorry, but we'll need to see some proof of identification.\nPrincess Cadance: We'll take care of things from here.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Cadance, thank goodness! What's going on?\nShining Armor: We can explain, Twily... if it really is you.\nPrincess Cadance: Sunshine, sunshine...\nPrincess Cadance and Twilight Sparkle: ...ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake! Mmm!\nShining Armor: It's okay, everypony. It's her.\nStarlight Glimmer: Of course it's her! What's all this about?\nSunburst: A changeling's been spotted nearby.\nTwilight Sparkle: A changeling?!\nSpike: That's not good.\nPrincess Cadance: No, it's not. After Queen Chrysalis took my place at our wedding and invaded Canterlot with her army of minions, we're not taking any chances.\nSunburst: Changelings feed off of love. And ever since Flurry Heart's Crystalling, the Empire is filled with more love than anywhere in Equestria. It's possible they've come for the baby.\nShining Armor: That's why we posted the extra guards, and why we're\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: Checking everypony's identity.\nPrincess Cadance: I'm sorry for all of this. Flurry Heart's really been looking forward to seeing you.\nFlurry Heart: [coos]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, she's gotten so big! Starlight and I will do whatever we can to help protect her.\nPrincess Cadance: To be honest, having you here is already a big relief.\nRoyal guard 2: [whispers indistinctly]\nShining Armor: Hmm. The royal guards were wondering if Spike the Brave and Glorious would like to join in the search for the changeling.\nSpike: Really?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, I don't know if that's such a good idea, Spike. It sounds dangerous.\nSpike: Come on, Twilight, this is Spike the Brave and Glorious you're talking to. Have you ever known me to run from danger?\nTwilight Sparkle: Um...\nShining Armor: He'll be safe with our guards.\nSpike: Or will your guards be safe with me?\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\n\nRoyal guard 1: Spike the Brave and Glorious, you've faced the evil changelings before. What can you tell us?\nSpike: Oh, uh, well, they are changelings, so they can... change.\nRoyal guard 1: [to other guards] You hear that? These monsters can look like any of us, so be on guard, guards! Even more than normal.\nSpike: And they could be anywhere.\nRoyal guards: [affirming snort]\nSpike: So we should cover as much ground as possible. You, search that way!\n[whoosh]\nSpike: And you, search that way!\n[whoosh]\nSpike: And... I'll... just search... here, I guess. Not many places to hide. Unless that rock is a changeling. Okay, rock. How do I know you're really a rock? Hmm. Not talkin', huh? Well, you can't fool me! Uhh! Ow! [screams]\n\nSpike: Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Oh! Uhh!\n[boulder thuds]\nSpike: Phew! [kisses] Okay. Maybe it's time Spike the Brave and Glorious went back to, uh, protect those guards. Gah! [sighs] Just my reflection. Huh? Ha! Ha-ha! Hmm. Just my imagination, I guess.\n[transformation noise]\nSpike: [screams]\n\nSpike: Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-changeling! [stutters]\nThorax: No, wait! Come back!\nSpike: [screaming]\n[thud]\nSpike: [screaming] This is unexpected.\n[splat]\nThorax: The ice is pretty slippery. I wouldn't want you to get hurt because of me.\nSpike: You... saved me?\nThorax: It's okay. I know you don't wanna be friends.\nSpike: Wait! I don't understand. Changelings are supposed to be evil... right?\nThorax: Evil? Oh, not me. All I've ever wanted is a friend.\n\nThorax: [narrating] From the moment I first split my egg in the nursery hive...\n[changeling larva hissing]\nBaby Thorax: [whimpering]\n\nThorax: [narrating] I was part of the attack on Canterlot during the royal wedding, but I'd never seen true friendship like that! And I couldn't just steal it and feed on its love. I wanted to share it!\n[explosion]\n\nThorax: After that, I knew I couldn't live with my kind anymore. I set off looking for love to share, but...\nSpike: But... what?\nThorax: I'm starving! And there's so much love in the Crystal Empire right now. It's what drew me here! But it's drivin' me crazy!\nSpike: That would be from the royal Crystalling. It's pretty much a giant outpouring of light and love for a new baby.\nThorax: [hisses] Oh, sorry! I'm just so hungry! If I had a friend, maybe the love we shared could sustain me, but I don't think the Crystal Ponies want to be friends.\nSpike: What if I told you there was somepony they respect and admire so much, he could convince them to give it a try?\nThorax: If only that were true.\nSpike: It is! I mean, I am! It's me, Spike! Spike the Brave and Glorious? I'm sure you've heard of me.\nThorax: Nope. But I was raised by an evil queen. I'm Thorax. I can't believe you want to help me.\nSpike: Why? Hasn't anypony ever just been nice to you?\nThorax: [hisses] Uh! S-Sorry! Kindness like that kind of brings it out. Do you still wanna be my friend?\nSpike: Of course! And I am one hundred percent sure I can get the whole Crystal Empire to be your friend too.\nThorax: [hisses]\nSpike: But... maybe I should just, uh, talk to them first.\nThorax: [muffled grunting]\n\nRoyal guard 1: What do you mean? Did you see the changeling?\nRoyal guard 2: Did you defeat the evil creature?\nSpike: Defeating a changeling would be brave, but do you know what would be glorious?\nRoyal guard 1: Defeating two changelings?\nRoyal guard 2: Defeating all the changelings?\nSpike: Not having to fight the changeling at all! Because I made friends with him.\n[guards laughing]\nRoyal guard 1: Oh, wow! For a second I thought you were serious!\nRoyal guard 2: [laughing] Could you imagine? Friends with a changeling?\nSpike: I am serious. He wants to be friends!\n[guards laughing]\nRoyal guard 2: Right!\nRoyal guard 1: Not only are you Spike the Brave and Glorious, you're also Spike the Hilarious!\nRoyal guard 2: [laughing]\nSpike: I'm not joking! The changeling is nice!\n[guards laughing harder]\nShining Armor: I'm sorry, but I don't think it's funny. The Changeling Queen Chrysalis kidnapped Cadance and cast a spell on me.\n[zip!]\nShining Armor: There's no such thing as a nice changeling.\nSpike: You're right, Shining Armor. Sorry. That was a... bad joke.\n\nThorax: So? So? Uh, what did they say? How many new friends do I have?\nSpike: Well, it didn't go exactly the way I thought.\nThorax: [groans] I understand. Well, thanks for trying. I-I guess it's not surprising. How can you expect ponies who looks like this... [transformation noise] to trust something that looks like this? [transformation noise]\nSpike: I think I might know!\n\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, if you're done searching for the changeling, Starlight and I could use your help. We're working on a protection spell for Flurry Heart, and nopony takes notes like you.\nSpike: Uh, actually, Twilight, I, uh, wanted to introduce you to my friend, uh... Uh, Crystal, uh... Hoof! Crystal Hoof! [chuckles] My good friend, Crystal Hoof.\nThorax: Nice to meet you.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. Well, it's, uh, nice to meet you, too. How do you know Spike?\nThorax: Oh, uh, Spike and I go way back.\nSpike: To the Equestria Games! That's when we met. We've been pen pals ever since.\nTwilight Sparkle: Pen pals? Spike! You could have been using my pen pal quill set! Why didn't you tell me?\nSpike: Well, I... I pretty much only write to him when you and Starlight are... studying.\nThorax: I like to brag to all my friends about my letters from Spike the Brave and Glorious.\nSpike: Yeah. [laughs nervously]\nThorax and Spike: [laugh nervously]\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, I'm sure Starlight and I can manage, if you want to spend time with your friend.\nSpike: Great! Crystal Hoof promised to take me around the city.\nThorax: Oh, that was amazing!\nSpike: I told ya.\n\n[montage music]\n\nRoyal guard 1: [hushed] Crystal Hoof is nearly as entertaining as Spike himself.\nThorax: [gasps] This place is everything I've ever dreamed of! [hushed] But I can't keep pretending to be a Crystal Pony forever, can I?\nSpike: Relax. You're winning them over. Pretty soon, nopony will care that you're a changeling.\nPrincess Cadance: Spike! Twilight told me you were off with a friend.\nSpike: [nervous laugh]\nPrincess Cadance: And any friend of Spike the Brave and Glorious is a friend of mine.\nFlurry Heart: [coos]\nThorax: Oh, she's so beautiful! There's so much l-love around her...! I... I...!\n[transformation noise]\nThorax: [hisses]\nPrincess Cadance: [gasps]\nTwilight Sparkle and Starlight Glimmer: [gasps]\nThorax: I... [hisses] I'm so... [hisses] ...sorry...! I can't... Can't [hisses] ...stop!\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike! Get away from the changeling!\nSpike: Wait, no! You don't understand!\nSunburst: This changeling replaced your friend to get close to the baby! What other explanation could there be?!\nSpike: I...\nThorax: [hisses]\nSpike: ...I don't know.\nThorax: [whimpers]\nRoyal guard 1: After it! Don't let the changeling escape!\nPrincess Cadance: I hope your friend is okay.\nSpike: Yeah... Me, too.\n\nRoyal guard 1: Spike, you should go find Crystal Hoof while we hunt down the changeling.\nSpike: I'm pretty sure he doesn't wanna see me.\nShining Armor: Spread out! The changeling is probably still nearby!\nSpike: Actually, I'm pretty sure he ran as far away from here as possible.... But I bet I know where!\n\nSpike: Thorax! Hello? I just want to apologize! I should have stood up for you... Aw, come on, Thorax! I know you're in here!\n[transformation noise]\nThorax: Leave me alone! [hisses]\nSpike: [yelps] [panting] Little help?\nThorax: Why do you think I would help you? I'm an \"evil changeling\"!\nSpike: Because you're my friend. I just wish I had been one to you. [yelps]\nThorax: It's okay, I know it's hard. Everyone in the Crystal Empire loves you. I couldn't ask you to give that up for me.\nSpike: You don't have to ask.\nThorax: What are you gonna do?\nSpike: What I should've done in the first place.\n\nRoyal guards: Let's move! Move! Move! This way! This way! Let's go! Check there? Okay. Over here! Over here! [etc.]\n[guards shouting]\nRoyal guard: Look around that corner! Over there! Over there! [etc.]\nStarlight Glimmer: I know it's bad that there's a changeling around, but is all this really necessary?\nPrincess Cadance: If there's one changeling, there may well be a whole army on the way.\nTwilight Sparkle: True. But Starlight has a point. This is getting a little out of hand.\nPrincess Cadance: [sighs] I understand, but I don't know what else we can do.\nSpike: I do!\n[ponies gasp]\nShining Armor: Spike! What are you doing?! Get away from that thing!\nSpike: No. He's not a \"thing\"!

[to others] As the Princess of Friendship, I try to set an example for all of Equestria. But today, it was Spike who taught me that a new friend can come from anywhere. I guess everypony still has things to learn about friendship. Even me! And if Spike says Thorax is his friend, then he's my friend too.\nThorax: Thank you.\nPrincess Cadance: On behalf of the Crystal Empire, I would like to extend my hoof in friendship, and I'm sure all of my subjects are eager to do the same.\n[guards cheering]\nFlurry Heart: [coos]\nShining Armor: Welcome to the Crystal Empire, Thorax. I'm sorry we didn't take the time to get to know you. Maybe we can change that now.\nThorax: That'd be so amazing!

Three of us would be way better than two...\nDiscord: That does sound fun, actually...\nSpike: Too bad you're busy.\n[magic zap]\nDiscord: Well, I suppose I could squeeze you in if I move a few very important ponies around.\n[click]\nDiscord: [gravelly accent] June, honey, be a dear. Reschedule Luna and Cay-Cay. [normal, aside] That's what I call Princess Celestia, what a hoot! [gravelly accent] In fact, clear the whole evening. Tonight is guys' night. These fellas invited me to spice things up and bring a little class to the whole affair.\n[magic zap]\n[rumble]\nDiscord: [normal voice] Tonight will be the best night of your lives, and not just because you get to bask in my greatness.\nSpike: I do like basking in things. See you tonight. [hushed] Twilight's castle. The fun starts promptly at sundown.\nDiscord: Technically, the fun starts when I arrive, but I'll make sure it's around sunset. Adieu, fellas.\n[magic zap]\n\nSpike: And... we have sundown. Repeat, we have sundown. I declare tonight's guys' night ceremonies officially open!\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\nSpike: It's guys' night.\nBig McIntosh: Yup.\nSpike: Oh, yeah.\nBig McIntosh: Yup.\nSpike: Havin' fun now.\nBig McIntosh: Yup.\nSpike: Oh, yeah!\nBig McIntosh: Oh, yeah!\n[fanfare]\nSpike: What the hay?\n[cartoon skedaddling]\nMini-Discord: [high-pitched] Announcing the much anticipated arrival of the spirit of chaos and disharmony, the purveyor of pandemonium, lord of lawlessness, earl of turmoil, bringer of bedlam... [imitating fanfare] Discord!\n[electronic music playing]\n[confetti exploding]\n[magic zap]\nDiscord: So, shall we hop to it? I made a list of the rowdiest establishments in Ponyville. It's rather short.\nSpike: Actually, we're staying here. I hope you like awesome games!\nDiscord: Games? I love games. I'm great at games.\n[magic zap]\nDiscord: Famous pony charades? Oh, this is an easy one. Who am I? Huh? Huh?\n[beat]\nDiscord: Oh, come on!\nSpike: Uh... I'm talkin' about a real game.\nDiscord: Oh, you mean like trapping best friend ponies in hedge mazes and turning them against each other. Those were the days.\n[Celestia's mane yowls]\n[magic zap]\nSpike: Not exactly. Wait here.\n[beat]\nDiscord: Whatever it is, it can only get better by adding me to the mix.\nSpike: [off-screen] Okay!\n\n[click]\nSpike: In a world where evil reigns supreme, a small band of warriors stands tall against the darkness. This is... Ogres & Oubliettes!\nDiscord: [gasps]\n\nDiscord: Oh, this looks like...\nSpike: The best game ever? You're right!\nDiscord: Yes...\nSpike: Ogres & Oubliettes is a fantasy role-playing adventure game. Our goal, defeat the evil Squid Wizard, or... [stifling laughter] as we call him... the Squizard!\nBig McIntosh: [stifled laughter]\n[beat]\nSpike: [chuckling] [clears throat] The Squizard has laid siege to the last free city in Spiketopia. That's the name of the land. He's kidnapped a beautiful unicorn princess named Shmarity. [beat] Uh, which is like a normal name in Spiketopia, so, you know, don't think about it too much.\nDiscord: Fear not. Your romantic delusions are safe with me.\n[zip!]\nSpike: First things first \u2013 you've gotta create a character! Name?\nDiscord: How about... Discord?\nSpike: [sighs] The whole point of the game is you get to use your imagination to be someone you're not. I'm Garbunkle, a famous magician. Everyone treats me with the utmost respect.\nDiscord: Just like in real life?\n[crack]\nSpike: And don't get jealous, but I'm a level 30 Enchanter with major skill points assigned to Intellect and Perception.\n[hairdryer running]\nDiscord: [not listening] Go on, I'm listening.\nSpike: Big Mac's character is Sir McBiggun, a level 27 Black Knight Unicorn from Castle Chadwick!\nDiscord: [still not listening] I'm listening.\nSpike: When his king aligned himself with the Squizard, Sir McBiggun would not besmirch his honor.\nBig McIntosh: Nnope!\nDiscord: [clears throat] [mumbling] I'm listening.\nSpike: And so it came to pass, the magician and black knight vowed to rid Spiketopia of the evil Squizard.\n[balloon deflating]\nSpike: So, your character's name?\nDiscord: I already have the best name in the universe. Why would I change it for something like \"Captain Wuzz\"?\nSpike: Captain Wuzz it is!\nDiscord: [groans]\nSpike: What class are you, Captain Wuzz? There's Archers, Mages, Rogues...\nDiscord: [snorts] Can I suggest we take a break and, I don't know, go out and have some fun? Ponyville's not going to paint itself red.\nSpike: You'll love it once we get started! [rolls die] How 'bout an Archer?\nDiscord: Sounds just as miserable as the other options. So fine.\n[tok]\nSpike: Sir McBiggun, are you prepared to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nSpike: Discord, or should I say, Captain Wuzz, are you\u2014\nDiscord: Oh, get on with it.\nSpike: [rolls dice] We find ourselves trapped in the dungeon of the evil Squizard. The bars are locked tight.\n[beat]\nSpike: The bars exist in our imagination.\nDiscord: Really? You describe things, and then we pretend it's real?\nSpike: It is real. In our imagination. It's your turn first. What do you wanna do?\nDiscord: Curse myself for attending this infernal evening? Ohhh, no, you mean in the game.\nSpike: Well, you can do whatever you want. Then, I roll this twenty-sided die and see if you're successful.\n[clang]\nDiscord: I stick my head through the bars and demand for the immediate release of the Lord of Chaos.\nSpike: That's a big risk. You have to roll a seventeen or higher to succeed. [rolls die] Ooh, bad idea. The guard gets mad.\nDiscord: This spell here. I transform him into a parsnip.\nSpike: You need eleven Intelligent points to cast a Transform Into Root Vegetable spell.\nDiscord: I'm not intelligent? I cast it anyway because this game is stupid.\n[thud]\nSpike: [rolls die] The spell backfires. So [stifling laughter] your claws grow leaves and transform into parsnips!\nBig McIntosh: [chuckling] Parsnips. [laughs]\nDiscord: [growls]\nSpike: The guard laughs. He calls his friends over, and they laugh too.\nSpike and Big McIntosh: [laughing]\nDiscord: Don't you laugh at me, Big Mac! Does it really say that? Let me see.\nBig McIntosh: [laughing]\nSpike: [rolls die] [laughs] As you get angrier, everypony laughs harder!\nDiscord: I seal Sir McBiggun in a magic bubble until he stops laughing!\nSpike: I told you, you can't do magic!\nSpike and Big McIntosh: [laughing]\n[magic zap]\nBig McIntosh: Whoaa! Nope! Nope! Nope!\nDiscord: \"Not intelligent enough.\" Please.\nSpike: Cut it out, Discord!\nDiscord: Oh, this game is insufferable! Let me show you a real guys' night!\n[snap]\n\n[upbeat jazz]\nDiscord: [laughing] This is the life! Jazz, dancing, the best table magic can buy! This is what guys' night is all about. Am I right, fellas?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\nSpike: I know you probably didn't do this on purpose, but this table's the perfect size and shape!\nDiscord: I don't think so. Let's have a drink. Chocolate milkshakes?\nSpike: [sighs] No, we want to go back to Ogres &\u2014\nDiscord: Oh, how 'bout a different game? [magic zap] Those are very bad cards.\nSpike: Stop messing with us! We wanna\u2014\n[magic zap]\nDiscord: A dance contest?\n[upbeat jazz BGM]\nDiscord: Surprise! We won!\nSpike: Discord!\nDiscord: [sinister] Yes?\nSpike: Look, we don't wanna do these things. We wanna play our game. If you don't want to play with us, you can, I don't know, sit and watch.\nDiscord: Sit and watch? Fine. We'll play your game. [reverberating] Are you ready to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?\n[magic zap]\n\nSpike: Sir McBiggun?!\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\nSpike: And I'm... Garbunkle? That means... Sweetness! We're in the game! Check it out! Ka-zam!\n[magic zaps]\n[shings]\nSpike: It's guys' night!\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\nSpike: Oh, yeah!\nBig McIntosh: Yup!\nSpike: In the game now!\nBig McIntosh: Yup!\nSpike: Oh, yeah!\nBig McIntosh: Oh, yeah!\nSpike: Discord, where are you? This is great! You made the game real!\nDiscord: [reverberating] [laughs] Aren't games fun?\nSpike: Should we be worried he's using his scary voice?\n[army marching]\nSquizard: Behold! I am the Squizard!\nSpike and Big McIntosh: [gasps]\nDiscord: [reverberating] [chuckles] You're welcome.\nSquizard: Attack!\n\n[army shouting]\nSpike: Run!\nSpike and Big McIntosh: [panting]\n[arrows being fired]\nDiscord: [reverberating] You find yourself on the battlefield. A barrage of arrows rains down on you. If you roll a fifteen or higher, the shield protects you. Fourteen or lower and, well... [laughs] You get the idea.\n[thud]\n[magic zap]\nDiscord: Seventeen! Lucky you!\nBig McIntosh: [grunts]\nDiscord: Boo.\nSpike and Big McIntosh: [panting]\nDiscord: Boo.\nSpike and Big McIntosh: [screaming]\nSpike: Discord!\n[magic zap]\nDiscord: Sir McBiggun, I'd cover the entrance if I were you.\n[shing!]\nSpike: This isn't funny!\nDiscord: Isn't this what every gamer wants? To live the game? Like this?!\n[magic zaps]\n[thud]\nSpike: Ugh!\n[army shouting]\n[thud]\nSpike: [groans] This kinda hurts! Like, real pain!\n[magic zap]\nDiscord: Oh, how kind of you to notice. It's the little details that really bring alternate dimensions to life, wouldn't you say?\nSpike: Discord, this is awful!\n[magic zap]\nSquizard: Of course it is! Spiketopia will be mine! And Rarity shall be my bride!\n[beat]\nSquizard: I mean, Shmarity.\n[magic zap]\nSpike and Big McIntosh: [gibbering]\n[thud]\nSpike: Why are you doing this? You're the worst!\nDiscord: If I'm the worst, then why did you invite me?\nSpike: Because we felt bad for you!\nDiscord: Because you... what?!\n[snap]\n\n[magic zap]\nSpike: [panting] We're okay, we're okay! No thanks to you, Discord!\nDiscord: You felt sorry for me?\nSpike: Who wouldn't? Fluttershy told us you practically begged her to stay! And then at the train station, you were just standing there, all alone!\nDiscord: This can't be. I'm supposed to feel sorry for you because I'm me and you're you.\nSpike: [sighs] We only invited you to be nice! I mean, you're kind of a... weirdo!\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nDiscord: I ruined your night, and you don't even think I'm cool? Ugh. [zap] [muffled] How embarrassing. I should go. [normal] I have a lot of other friends I need to see tonight.\nSpike: Good!\nDiscord: Yes, so many other friends. [whimpers] Farewell, Garbunkle the magician and brave Sir McBiggun. May providence smile upon thee in thy quest to rid Spiketopia of the dreaded Squizard... [sighs] When I say it that way, the game doesn't sound half bad.\n[magic zap]\nDiscord: Oh, well.\n[magic zap]\nSpike: [sighs] It... it's better this way, right?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nSpike: Because... now he can't bother us, 'cause he's off somewhere by himself... all alone... with no friends.\nBig McIntosh: Yup.\nSpike: [sighs] [clears throat] [unenthusiastic] We find ourselves in the dungeon of the evil Squizard. The bars are locked, and... Ah, who am I kidding? We should give him another chance. [clears throat] Captain Wuzz? Can you hear me?\n[magic zap]\nDiscord: Oh! You realized how amazing I am and that I make you cooler just by being around me?\n[beat]\nDiscord: Uh... [stammering] No, no, actually, that's not what I meant to say... I'm... sssssss...\nSpike: What?\nDiscord: I'm ssssssss\u2014\nSpike: Can't hear you.\nBig McIntosh: Nope.\nDiscord: I'm trying to say I'm sorry, all right?! I'm sorry for ruining your game, and I'm sorry that I thought I was better than you! [pants] [quickly] Now let's play before this evening gets any sappier, shall we?\n[magic zap]\nBig McIntosh: [unintelligible whispering]\nSpike: Huh? Yeah, yeah! Okay! What if we forgot the board and the pieces for a minute? I mean, the whole game coming to life was completely terrifying, but also kind of the best thing ever! So, uh, Big Mac and I were wondering... What if you toned it down just a teensy bit?\n\n[main cast chattering]\n[doors open]\nMane Six: Huh?\n[army shouting]\nSpike: I've got your back, Captain Wuzz!\n[magic zap]\nBig McIntosh: Wha-hah!\nDiscord: [grunts]\nSpike, Big McIntosh and Discord: [panting]\nSquizard: [evil laughter]\nDiscord: [accented] Garbunkle! Follow my lead!\n[magic zap]\nSquizard: [squeaks]\n[crunch]\nSpike: Bull's-eye!\nDiscord: Nice one!\nSpike and Discord: It's guys' night!\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\nSpike and Discord: Oh, yeah!\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\nSpike and Discord: Having fun now!\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\nSpike and Discord: Oh, yeah!\nBig McIntosh: Oh, yeah!\nTwilight Sparkle: We should just close the door and let them finish... whatever this... is.\nRainbow Dash: No way! Did you see Big Mac's sword? I totally want in!\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! I don't know what it is, but it looks like super duper fun!\nPinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash: Guys' night!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[birds chirping]\nApplejack: [hocks, spits]\n[wind whistling]\n[thunk]\n[slow motion sounds]\nRainbow Dash: Hey, Applejack! Whatcha doin'?\nApplejack: Whoa! Oof! Ugh! Well, I was practicin' my distance buckin'.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, distance bucking? What for?\nApplejack: Because Cousin Braeburn and the rest of the Apple family in Appleloosa seem to think that their team can beat Ponyville at buckball.\n[thunk, smack]\n[thud]\nRainbow Dash: What?! Ha! That's ridiculous! Nopony beats Ponyville! I mean, I could beat the whole town of Appleloosa at buckball with one wing tied behind my back!\n[thunk]\nApplejack: [grunts]\nRainbow Dash: [grunts]\nApplejack: [grunts]\n[crash]\nApplejack: So I can count on ya to join the Ponyville buckball team?\nRainbow Dash: Oh, yeah! I am so there! I've just got one question.\nApplejack: Hmm?\nRainbow Dash: Uh... what's buckball?\nApplejack: [groans]\n\n[theme song]\n\nRainbow Dash: So, basically, buckball is the coolest game ever. Offense, defense, teamwork, nonstop action! It's got it all!\nFluttershy: Wow, Rainbow Dash. You sure seem to know a lot about this game. I've never even heard of... buckball.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, I'm kind of an expert.\nApplejack: Hmph. An expert who hadn't heard of the game either until I told you.\nRainbow Dash: Well, it's a new game. I probably know more than most ponies, so that makes me an expert.\nPinkie Pie: I don't know anything about it at all. But it sounds like there's a ball and bucking, so I'm betting it's super duper fun!\nApplejack: The point is, my cousin Braeburn somehow convinced a Pegasus and a unicorn to come play with him on the Appleloosa team, and he can't stop braggin' about how his team is gonna beat ours!\nFluttershy: But, um, we don't have a team.\nRainbow Dash: Well, between Applejack and me, we've got two-thirds of a team. All we need is a unicorn. That's where you two come in.\nPinkie Pie: [whispering loudly to Fluttershy] Uh... they know we're not unicorns, right?\nRainbow Dash: Uh, obviously. You're gonna be on my team, and Fluttershy is gonna be on Applejack's team.\nApplejack: We'll play against each other along with whatever unicorns want to try out until we find the best one.\nPinkie Pie: Ohhhh! Phew! That's a relief because I left my unicorn costume at home!\n\nApplejack: I know a lot of you are here because I told you what an amazin' game buckball is. And even though it's already an Apple family favorite, most o' you probably don't know anything about it. So I thought we'd give you a quick demonstration. The two Earth ponies are on offense. They meet in the middle of the field for the buckoff. They both try to be the first one to kick it.\n[ball bounces]\nApplejack: [grunts]\nRainbow Dash: And the Pegasus is on defense. She tries to keep the ball from going in the goal and passes it back to the Earth pony on her team. Just give it a little kick, Pinkie.\nPinkie Pie: Yaah!\nFluttershy: Aah!\n[thud]\nPinkie Pie: Ohhh. I get it.\nApplejack: And all the unicorns have to do is float these here baskets around the outside of the field and catch as many balls as possible for their team. [to Pinkie and Fluttershy] You two get the idea?\nPinkie Pie: Absolutely!\nFluttershy: Oh, I don't know. That ball moves pretty fast.\nRainbow Dash: All right. Now let's see which of you has what it takes.\n\"Crimson Heart\": Um, what do I do?\nRainbow Dash: When the ball comes towards you, catch it.\nGranny Smith: [blows whistle]\nApplejack: Okay, just try your best, Pinkie. I have been doin' this a lot longer than you.\nPinkie Pie: [grunts] Aah!\nApplejack: [dazzled] Nice kick.\nFluttershy: Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa! Whee! [giggles]\nApplejack: Great save, Fluttershy!\n\"Aloha\": [gasps]\nRainbow Dash: Coming your way, Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie: Somersault kick!\n\"Crimson Heart\": [whimpers]\n[thud]\nPinkie Pie: Hey, this game is easy!\nFluttershy: Ooh! [giggles] It actually is kinda fun!\nApplejack: Where did Pinkie Pie learn to buck like that?\nRainbow Dash: And Fluttershy's spinning tail catch is pretty amazing.\nApplejack: Um... okay. Well, let's see what the rest of you can do.\n\nApplejack: Now, don't expect to be able to beat me twice in a row.\nPinkie Pie: [grunts]\nFluttershy: Well, hello there, Mr. Ball. Whee!\nApplejack: [grunts]\nRainbow Dash: Hiya!\nFluttershy: Hurry along, butterflies, before that ball comes and hits you.\nSea Swirl: Aah!\n[whoosh]\nApplejack: Nope. Um... okay. Let's see what the rest of you can do.\n\n[bonk!]\nRainbow Dash: Nope.\n\nApplejack: Definitely not.\n\n[whirl!]\n\"Sweet Biscuit\": [gags]\nRainbow Dash: No.\n\nApplejack: Not a chance.\n\nRainbow Dash: No.\nApplejack: Nope.\nRainbow Dash: Aaaand... no.\n\nRainbow Dash: [groans] This didn't go how I thought it would.\nPinkie Pie: Whee! [giggles, grunts] Yeah! Ha! [giggles] Whee! Ha ha!\nApplejack: It sure didn't.\nFluttershy: This game is a whole lot more fun than I thought it would be.\nPinkie Pie: It's exactly as much fun as I thought it would be! A whole bunch!\n[Snails]\nCarryin' my water\nMy water, my water\nCarryin' my water\nOn my shoulder pole\nPinkie Pie: Snails! Look out!\nSnails: Hmm?\n[water splashing]\nApplejack: Amazing!\nSnails: You should be more careful with these. You could lose them.\nRainbow Dash: Hey, Snails, can you float one of those baskets over here?\nSnails: Hmm? Sure. What do you want me to do with it?\nApplejack: Catch!\nSnails: Anything else?\nFluttershy: Wow, Snails. You're a natural at buckball.\nPinkie Pie: It's a good thing, too. We were running out of unicorns.\nFluttershy: Do you think you'll be ready to play with Applejack and Rainbow Dash against the Appleloosa team?\nSnails: I guess I'll find out. Plus, after I deliver this water, I don't really have anything else to do.\nRainbow Dash: Well, Snails, with you on the team, Ponyville is one step closer to crushing Appleloosa!\nApplejack: Huh. And after today, it's pretty clear who the other two players should be.\nFluttershy: W-What do you mean? I thought you and Dash were gonna play.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! If you're not crushing Appleloosa, who is?\nRainbow Dash: [laughs] Uh, you two, obviously!\n\nCarryin' my water\nMy water, my water\nCarryin' my water\nOn my shoulder pole\n\nFluttershy: Um, you want us to play buckball against Appleloosa instead of you?\nRainbow Dash: Mm-hmm.\nPinkie Pie: That's \"uncredible\"!\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: Unbelievable and incredible? [scoffs] Come on!\nApplejack: I can't explain it, but you two are really good at this game. And if it means beatin' Appleloosa, I'll give either one of you my spot on the team quicker than Granny Smith can core an apple.\nRainbow Dash: Me, too. I'd normally be so pumped all of Ponyville was counting on me to win, I'd run right over the competition. But you still flew rings around me.\nFluttershy: Oh, I'm sorry. I was just having fun.\nApplejack: Well, you can have all the fun you want as long as it's while you're beatin' the hide off of Braeburn's team.\nPinkie Pie: I do like fun!\nFluttershy: Honestly, the game was a little scary at first, but once I got the hang of it, I had a pretty good time.\nPinkie Pie: Let's get this party started!\nApplejack: All right. But if we really wanna beat Appleloosa, we're gonna have to get serious.\nFluttershy: Serious?\nPinkie Pie: Serious how?\n\nApplejack: With serious practice!\nFluttershy: [gulps] Wow. This looks pretty intense.\nRainbow Dash: Well, duh! You two are gonna be representing all of Ponyville. And, more importantly, us!\nApplejack: That's why, before we leave for Appleloosa tomorrow, you two are gonna practice just as hard as we would.\nRainbow Dash: So let's hop to it! Snails already has a head start on you!\n[balls bouncing]\n\nRainbow Dash: Okay, if you wanna win, you totally gotta get this drill down!\n[knees shaking]\nFluttershy: I-I-I do?\n[epic rock training montage music]\nFluttershy: [gasps, gasps loudly, gasps, whimpers]\n[brakes screech, music stops]\nRainbow Dash: It's all about ball control.\nFluttershy: [gasps] Whoa!\nRainbow Dash: Ready? Go! Come on! Faster! You don't want Ponyville to lose because you can't get into high gear, do you?!\nFluttershy: [gasps] Whoa! Ugh!\n\nApplejack: All right. Bein' able to buck a ball into a goal from any direction is the most important thing in the game.\nPinkie Pie: Eh, if you say so.\n[bucks, thud]\nPinkie Pie: Whee! Whee! Whee! Whoopee! Woo-hoo! [grunts]\n[thud]\nPinkie Pie: Whee! Woo-hoo!\n[balls thudding]\nApplejack: Keep it up! Just one miss'll ruin the Apple family's buckball reputation forever!\nPinkie Pie: Whoa! What?! [grunts]\n[bonk]\nPinkie Pie: Whoops.\n\n[epic rock training montage music]\nRainbow Dash: Come on! Push! Push! Push!\n[clang]\n[circling birdies]\n\nApplejack: Come on, now! Every shot is for Sweet Apple Acres! And me! And Dash! And all of Ponyville!\nPinkie Pie: Whoa! Uhh! Ow.\n\nRainbow Dash: Faster!\nFluttershy: Whoa!\n\nApplejack: Come on now!\nPinkie Pie: Wh-Wh-Whoa!\n\nRainbow Dash: Come on!\nFluttershy: Aah! [gasps]\n\nApplejack: Keep it up!\nPinkie Pie: Whoa!\n\nRainbow Dash: Come on!\n[bonking]\nFluttershy: [gasps]\nApplejack: What in the apple happened to those two?\nRainbow Dash: I don't know. They mopped the field with us before.\nFluttershy and Pinkie Pie: [grunting]\nApplejack: All right! That's it for today, y'all!\nFluttershy and Pinkie Pie: Phew!\nPinkie Pie: I thought practice was supposed to make us better.\nFluttershy: Maybe we just need a little rest.\nRainbow Dash: Or a whole lot of it.\nApplejack: Just be sure to get your heads in the game before tomorrow. All of Ponyville is countin' on a win.\n\nFluttershy: I really don't want to let Applejack and Rainbow Dash down, or anypony else, but after that practice, I'm not feeling very confident.\nPinkie Pie: Maybe we weren't that bad!\nFluttershy: [groans]\nPinkie Pie: I guess I was hoping you saw something I didn't.\nFluttershy: I know our friends want us to win, but how can the whole town be counting on us if most ponies have never even heard of buckball?\nPinkie Pie: I know! How can we disappoint a pony who doesn't even know we have a team?\nFluttershy: Or that we're gonna play Appleloosa?\nPinkie Pie: Pfft. Yeah. I don't think we need to worry. I'd be surprised if anypony in this town cares about this game at all.\n\nCrowd: Go, Ponyville! Go, Ponyville! Win, win, win! [background cheering] Woo-hoo! Ponyville! Way to go!\nSnails: Whoa. The whole town really seems to care about this game a lot.\nFluttershy and Pinkie Pie: [gasps]\n\n[train puffs]\n[crowd cheering]\nRainbow Dash: Heh. We kinda went around town and talked up the team a little.\nApplejack: Yup! We wanted to make sure you two knew that all of Ponyville was behind you!\nPinkie Pie: [nervous] Greaaaaat...\nApplejack: I hear the whole town's already plannin' a parade for when you get back after whuppin' Appleloosa! That should feel pretty good!\nFluttershy: [nervous] It should...?\nRainbow Dash: Totally! Just spend the whole ride to Appleloosa thinking about everypony cheering for the victorious Ponyville buckball team! [gasps] I bet Princess Celestia even comes to congratulate you! If that doesn't get you in \"the zone\", I don't know what will!\nFluttershy: I don't know what zone Rainbow Dash is talking about, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to be in it. Do you?\n\nRainbow Dash: Hey! You two are supposed to be in the zone!\nPinkie Pie: [squeaks] You see... the thing is... thinking about everypony... thinking about us...! Aah! There's just no way to...!\nFluttershy: There's no way that we can get in the zone, because the zone sounds like a horrible place since we are terrible at buckball and we are going to lose and let everypony down and we don't want to play anymore!\nPinkie Pie: [bawling]\nSnails: I'm still okay with playing, in case you were worried.\n\n[general background chatter]\nRainbow Dash: I don't get it. They're naturals! Why wouldn't they want to play anymore?\nApplejack: Maybe us telling them how much everypony was countin' on them messed them up somehow.\nRainbow Dash: What?! That's crazy talk! Having ponies depend on you is exactly what you need to focus! And\u2014\nApplejack: Get serious and play hard and\u2014\nRainbow Dash: Get ready to totally smash the competition, and\u2014 and... none of that sounds like Pinkie or Fluttershy, does it?\nApplejack: [sighs] Guess not. We got so wrapped up in what's important to us, we went and ruined what was fun about the game for them.\nRainbow Dash: [groans] What do we do now?\n\n[knocking]\n[door opens]\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie? Fluttershy?\nApplejack: We know you're in here! We've looked in every other car on the train!\nFluttershy: [muffled] Maybe you need to look again!\nPinkie Pie: [muffled] Yeah! Because... we're totally not in here!\nFluttershy: [muffled] And we're definitely not in here if you're gonna try and make us play against Appleloosa!\nPinkie Pie: Or anypony else!\nApplejack: [clears throat]\nFluttershy: Oh... we're sorry to let you down. But it's better to do it now than during the game against Appleloosa.\nRainbow Dash: You don't have to play against Appleloosa.\nFluttershy: We don't?\nApplejack: Nope. We're gonna take your place. So you don't have to worry about that at all.\nPinkie Pie: [sighs] Why didn't you say so?\nRainbow Dash: But... we can't take on Braeburn and his team without any practice. So we need you to play just one more time.\nApplejack: Against us.\n\nApplejack: Now I know we mixed up the teams before, but since Dash and I really need the practice, we'll play against the two of you.\nFluttershy: Oh, I don't know how much practice you'll get against us. We've been playing just awful.\nRainbow Dash: Don't worry about it. Applejack and I just need a little workout.\nApplejack: Yup. You two just do your best.\nPinkie Pie: I can do that!\n[whoosh]\nPinkie Pie: [nervous whimper]\n[whoosh]\nFluttershy: [nervous whimper]\nPinkie Pie: [gasps]\nApplejack: Ahem.\nFluttershy: [grunts] Huh!\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! [grunts]\nFluttershy: Looks like you two really do need practice!\n\n[various whooshes]\n[various thunks]\nPinkie Pie: Hee-hee! Ha! Whee!\nSnails: [snoring]\nFluttershy: [giggling] If you need more practice, we can keep going.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! I could do this all day!\nRainbow Dash: [panting] No, thanks. Playing against you two is just as humiliating now as it was when we weren't trying to show you how awesome you are.\nPinkie Pie: Wait... what?\nSnails: Finally!\n[thunk]\nApplejack: You must've noticed how you aren't bad anymore.\nPinkie Pie: Oh, yeah! Weird!\nFluttershy: But, um, why were we so terrible before?\nRainbow Dash: I guess some ponies thrive on pressure and some ponies don't. And even though we weren't playing, we were treating you like us, which totally stressed you out.\nApplejack: And that just sucked the fun right out of the game for you.\nRainbow Dash: And having fun is what makes you really, really, really good!\nFluttershy: But being good doesn't matter if we're too afraid of letting ponies down.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! What about all those ponies back in Ponyville counting on us to win?\nApplejack: I'm sure folks want you to win, but not if worrying about it makes you miserable. Winning's never worth that.\nFluttershy: But how do we keep from worrying about it?\nSnails: You could do what I do and not think about it. Seriously. I don't think about anything. Ever.\nPinkie Pie: Hm. Works for me!\n\n[crowd cheers]\nAnnouncer: And with another bouncing goal from Pinkie Pie, the score is tied!\nRainbow Dash: You guys are amazing!\nPinkie Pie: [panting] Braeburn is really good!\nFluttershy: So is that Pegasus. Oh, I don't know if we can win.\nSnails: You know what I would do?\nPinkie Pie: Not think about it?\nSnails: Not think a\u2014 [beat] Oh, yeah. That.\nApplejack: Ha. And as long as you're havin' fun, it doesn't matter if you win or not.\nLucky Clover: [blows whistle]\nPinkie Pie: [giggles] I think it's more fun this way!\n[thwack]\nAnnouncer: And Pinkie wins the buckoff! But her shot's rejected! Back to Braeburn, whose kick's stopped by another Fluttershy save! Next point wins. Lots of tense back and forth here. Fluttershy unleashes her patented spin move, but Braeburn's there to\u2014 No! It's Pinkie with a somersault kick! What a move! And that's the game! Ponyville wins!\nCrowd: [chanting] Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville!\nApplejack: Huh. Looks like you three made quite an impression!\nBraeburn: Well, cousin, I have to admit. Your Ponyville team played a pretty good game.\nRainbow Dash: Hah! Good game? We bucked the hooves right off of you!\nBraeburn: Yup, you sure as shootin' did. I'm gonna have to get real serious about a strategy for our rematch.\nFluttershy: Oh, I wouldn't get too serious.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! Everypony knows the secret to good buckball is just having fun!\nApplejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Snails: [laughing]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[sand throwing and splatting]\nSweetie Belle: So Scootaloo's keeping Petunia busy like you asked. What did you two want to talk about?\nMrs. Paleo: I'm sure you get these questions all the time. Oh, this is so awkward.\nMr. Paleo: Um, you're the experts, so we thought you'd have some insight into our daughter's new, uh, cutie mark.\nApple Bloom: What's wrong?\nMrs. Paleo: Obviously, we're both very proud of her and her cutie mark...\nMr. Paleo: Despite its, um... unsettling nature.\nSweetie Belle: Unsettling?\n[sand shuffling]\nApple Bloom: I don't get what you mean.\nMrs. Paleo: Her mark doesn't... bother you at all?\nScootaloo: Hey! Check out what we found!\nPetunia Paleo: Look! A spiny-backed ponysaurus! In our own backyard! And I found him on my very own! How cool is that?!\nMrs. Paleo and Mr. Paleo: Oh! [chuckles] She's an archaeologist.\nScootaloo: Of course! What'd you think she was gonna be, a pirate?\n[beat]\nMrs. Paleo: Pirate? Pfft! Why would we think that?\nMrs. Paleo and Mr. Paleo: [laughing nervously]\n\n[theme song]\n\nScootaloo: Woo-hoo! Another successful cutie intervention! You know, Crusaders, I don't wanna toot our own horn, but we've helped a lot of ponies figure out their purpose in life. Like Bluenote here. Nice saxophone, Bluenote!\n[saxophone playing]\nApple Bloom: Yep, everywhere you look, there's a pony we've helped find a purpose.\n[tap dancing]\nApple Bloom: You've gotta admit. We've had a pretty good effect on everypony since we've discovered our destiny.\nScootaloo: And started helping other ponies discover theirs! Could this get any better or what?\n\nSweetie Belle: Now, Scootaloo, you do know there will always be challenges? Someday, somepony might even come to us with a problem that even we can't handle. Like, say...\nApple Bloom: A griffon?\nSweetie Belle: Ha! Exactly! Like a griffon. But that's just crazy talk.\nScootaloo: Or not!\nSweetie Belle: Is that really a griffon?\nApple Bloom: You're darn tootin' it is! What do you think that griffon wants?\nSweetie Belle: I guess we've gotta ask her, but aren't griffons supposed to be kind of mean and cranky?\nScootaloo: Crusaders, looks like we've gotta step carefully.\nGabby: The Cutie Mark Crusaders! I can't believe it's really, really you! [laughs]\nScootaloo: [strained voice] Aah! Ooh! This... griffon's... not... cranky.\nApple Bloom: How in the blooming apples did you know who we are?\nGabby: Know who you are? Know who you are?! Why, I've heard about you from everypony in Ponyville! I'm so excited to meet you, I could just explode! I'm Gabriella, but you can call me Gabby since we're friends now! Pleased to meet ya!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [groaning shakily]\nApple Bloom: Well, howdy... um... Gabby.\nGabby: [squeals] I'm just about the most excited anygriffon has ever been about anything!\nSweetie Belle: Excited? But whatever for?\nGabby: What for? What for?! Everypony in town tells me of your amazing assistance! How you help ponies find their place in the world!\nScootaloo: It's a calling, but\u2014\nGabby: And that's why I'm here. I need help, too. I want you to give me a cutie mark!\nApple Bloom: Um, can a griffon even get a cutie mark?\nScootaloo: I dunno, but I think we should probably find out.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [chuckling nervously]\n\nScootaloo: So, Gabriella...\nGabby: Gabby, 'kay?\nScootaloo: Gabby, why do you even want a cutie mark?\nGabby: [slurping under]\nScootaloo: It doesn't seem like a very... griffon-y thing to want.\nGabby: Right? Right?! Right?!\n[thud]\nGabby: You're tellin' me! I don't know if you've heard, but griffons can be a little bit... unfriendly.\n\nGabby: [voiceover] Most griffons don't pay much attention to each other. And if they do, it's not, y'know, the good kind of attention. As for me, I'm just a little mail delivery griffon who likes to spread a little bit of griffon-y sunshine on my rounds, which always makes me feel different from the other griffons.\n[doors slamming]\nGabby: [voiceover] I'd do anything for any old griffon in need.\nElderly griffon: Ahh! Uhh!\nGabby: [voiceover] But it just always seemed like the harder I tried, the less I fit in. It wasn't until your friends came to Griffonstone that I realized some creatures actually like helping each other, and I saw something so awesomely awesome \u2013 how helping spreads from pony to pony and griffon to griffon! I knew then that I had to find out why I was so different from the other griffons, and I knew the answer just had to have something to do with those wonderful, amazing marks on the ponies' flanks. And I admit, hehe, I became, um, maybe a little obsessed. So first chance I had to deliver a letter from Gilda, I took it, so I could find the perfect pony to help me understand what those marks are. Everypony here told me one thing \u2013 I just had to see the Cutie Mark Crusaders! They've helped everypony here get their cutie marks, and I knew, I just knew, that someday I'd have one, too! A cutie mark of my very own!\n\nGabby: That's why I flew all the way here! I want to find my own place in the world, and I know you can help me by giving me a cutie mark! So let's make with the cutie! [giggles] Whenever you're ready. Did it happen yet?\nSweetie Belle: Uh, not exactly.\nGabby: Howboutnowhowboutnowhowboutnowhowboutnow?\nApple Bloom: Um, Gabby, I hate to break it to ya, but it sounds like you might've heard some tall tales about what Crusaders can do.\nScootaloo: I mean, we are kinda awesome and all, but nopony can just give you a cutie mark. It just sort of... happens.\nSweetie Belle: Though I'm pretty sure it doesn't happen to griffons. Or if it does, we've never ever heard of it.\nGabby: Oh. I hadn't thought of that. Sounds like a challenge! And who could be up to it but the world-famous Cutie Mark Crusaders? Cutie marks! It's in your name and everything, right? Right?! Right?! Now I have to deliver Gilda's letter to Rainbow Dash. I bet by the time I get back, you'll have it one hundred percent figured out! Toodles for now! Whee-hee-hee! Gonna get my cutie mark!\nSweetie Belle: What she wants... It's not possible, right?\nScootaloo: I don't know. But I know someone who just might.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I've read every book on the subject, and I've never read a thing about any creature other than a pony getting a cutie mark.\nScootaloo: But, Twilight, Gabby flew all the way here so we could help her. There's gotta be something we can do.\nSweetie Belle: Say, is there some kind of spell you can whip up to make her mark appear?\nTwilight Sparkle: Um, I don't know if any of you remember, but using magic to get a cutie mark never really works out all that well.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Ohhh. Right.\nTwilight Sparkle: Crusaders, I'm sorry. While I can't say for certain that it's utterly impossible, the chances of Gabby getting an actual mark are... pretty slim. Everything I've ever learned tells me. It's just not gonna happen.\nApple Bloom: Oh, no! Poor Gabby! What the apples are we ever gonna tell her?\n\nSweetie Belle: Crusaders, this is terrible! Gabby really believed in us. And now, we're gonna let her down.\nApple Bloom: But what else can we do?\nScootaloo: Hmm. You know what, Crusaders? So what? Maybe we can't help Gabby get a cutie mark, but we can still do what we're best at. We can help her find her purpose!\nApple Bloom: And I reckon doing that is the same for griffons as it is for ponies or any other creature in Equestria.\nScootaloo: All we have to do is be extra-special clear with her. Like, Crystal Empire clear.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Yeah!\n\nGabby: Incoming!\n[thud]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [straining]\nGabby: Hiya, you wonderful, wonderful Crusaders! I just know you've figured out how to help me because you're all so incredible!\nScootaloo: Well, Gabby, we've talked it over, and we think we may just be able to help you out. But not exactly in the way you think. See, here's the thing about you getting a cutie mark\u2014\nGabby: I'm getting a cutie mark!!! Woo-hoo-hoo! [yelling excitedly]\nScootaloo: Wait! You didn't let me finish!\nSweetie Belle: Um, I think maybe that could've been clearer.\n\nGabby: [rhythmically] Cutie mark! Cutie mark! Gonna get my cutie mark! [yelling excitedly]\nSweetie Belle: She's still going. Anypony know if griffons ever get tired?\nGabby: What do you think my mark will be? A lightning bolt? An erupting volcano? I don't care if it's a jar of marmalade! I know I'll love it, whatever it is!\nApple Bloom: Hold on just a hoofstep, Gabby. There's somethin' we need to clear up. We can definitely help you find your purpose, but that mark's probably not gonna happen.\nGabby: What?!?\nScootaloo: It's true. Twilight's never heard of a creature other than a pony getting a cutie mark.\nGabby: Oh! [laughs] Is that all? You had me worried for a second. I-I mean, there's a first time for everything, right? And she didn't say it was impossible, right?\nApple Bloom: Well, not exactly.\nGabby: Well, then if anypony can make it happen, it's you three. I mean, you haven't failed yet.\nScootaloo: You know what, Gabby? I promise we're gonna do everything we can to help you get your mark.\nGabby: Oh! It's gonna happen! I can feel it! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! [laughs]\nSweetie Belle: Aaaaand... she's off again.\nApple Bloom: Why in tarnation would you promise somethin' that just can't be done?\nScootaloo: I know what it's like to want something that's out of reach. And just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it can't. Maybe trying for the impossible isn't so bad.\nSweetie Belle: Guess we'll never know for sure unless we give it a try.\nApple Bloom: All right, but where do we even start?\nScootaloo: Where we always do \u2013 with a good old-fashioned Crusaders chart.\n\nApple Bloom: The first thing we gotta do is find your purpose.\nScootaloo: Nopony gets a mark without one.\nGabby: All right. Let's do this.\nScootaloo: What are you good at? Do you play any sports?\nApple Bloom: Or like to dance?\nSweetie Belle: Or how about singing? I just love to sing! La-la-la-la!\nGabby: Wow! I kinda wanna just try everything! I mean, I don't even know what to pick!\nScootaloo: Don't worry.

I don't know how we find what she's supposed to do when she can do it all.\nScootaloo: [sighs] And if finding her purpose seems impossible, we can just forget about the whole griffon-getting-a-cutie-mark thing, which is actually impossible. I never should've gotten her hopes up!\nGabby: I did... it... all! So, lay it on me, Crusaders. What's my purpose? And how do we get a mark on these here haunches?\nScootaloo: Gabby, we... we don't.\nGabby: Wait. What are you saying?\nApple Bloom: We're sayin' that since you can do everything so amazingly well...\nSweetie Belle: We just can't figure out what one thing you're supposed to do.\nScootaloo: Gabby, we can't help you.\nGabby: But, but... you're the world-famous Cutie Mark Crusaders! I can't believe it! I... I... I won't believe it!\nApple Bloom: Gabby, wait!\nScootaloo: We're sorry! We're so, so sorry! This is just awful. For the first time ever, the Cutie Mark Crusaders are cutie mark failures.\n\nScootaloo: I'm sorry, Crusaders. I really thought we could help Gabby.\nSweetie Belle: I thought we could help anypony.\nApple Bloom: Maybe that's just it \u2013 maybe we can only help ponies.\nScootaloo: Or maybe we just plain failed.\n[door opens]\nGabby: Failed? Then what do you call this?!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: A cutie mark?!\nSweetie Belle: What? You got your mark after all! Even though we couldn't find your purpose? But\u2013 What? Huh?! How?!\nApple Bloom: And what does it mean? A cauldron?\nGabby: Uh... I don't know. Maybe it means my purpose is, uh, helping Zecora with potions. That was the first thing I tried. I guess it just took some time to appear. But here it is!\nScootaloo: This is awesome! We're not failures! Whatever we did worked! I had a feeling we could help you, and we did!\nApple Bloom: Oh! We've gotta go see Twilight right away! She'll wanna know about this!\nSweetie Belle: Correction \u2013 she needs to know about this! I bet she'll want to write a whole book about the very first griffon to get a cutie mark of her own!\nGabby: Oh, uh, totally! Um, but, you know, Rainbow Dash asked me to pick up her answer to Gilda's letter. I better take care of that before I forget. Heh. Here's an idea. Uh, y-you head to the castle, and I'll meet you there, cutie mark and all! Um... toodles!\n[whoosh]\nScootaloo: Wow! Can you believe it? We were able to help her get her mark after all! Come on, Crusaders, let's tell Twilight!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Gabby? You just missed her. She was in such a hurry, she didn't even come in. Just dropped this letter and zoomed away!\nScootaloo: [reading] \"Dear Crusaders, I'll never forget you. You really are every bit as awesome as I'd heard.

Cutie mark?\n[teleportation zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: You actually got a griffon a cutie mark for the first time in recorded history?! You know what this calls for? A full-scale research project!\nSweetie Belle: This makes no sense. Gabby didn't come in and show you her mark?\nTwilight Sparkle: You have got to get Gabby back here right away! I have so many questions! Oh, I hope I have enough ink and parchment to document everything! Spike! Guess what just happened!\nApple Bloom: Weird. Gabby didn't show Twilight her mark like she said she was gonna do? Somethin' in this here applesauce smells kinda fishy.\nScootaloo: We'd better find her and find out what's going on. Come on, Crusaders.\n\nScootaloo: Keep your eyes on the skies, ponies. Gabby can't have gone far.\nApple Bloom: She's not in the air. She's right there! Gabby! Hold up, we're a-comin'!\nGabby: Um... Sorry, no time to chat. I-I just stopped to help this pony get out of the muck, and then I really gotta fly. Okay? Heave-ho! [grunts]\n[splat]\nSweetie Belle: Gabby, we're your friends. Why in Equestria are you running away from us?\nGabby: Running away? Oh, I'm not running away. I'm just, uh, e-excited to show my lovely new cutie mark to everyone in Griffonstone!\nApple Bloom: You mean the cutie mark that's runnin' right off your flank?\nGabby: [defeated] Yup... That's the one. I guess the one thing I'm really not good at is faking things.\nScootaloo: Wow, Gabby. Painting on a fake cutie mark to make yourself feel better? You must have been really upset.\nGabby: Sure, I was disappointed. But I didn't do it to make myself feel better. I wanted to make you feel better.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [gasp]\nGabby: I couldn't bear you three thinking you failed after you tried so hard to help. That's why I had to leave before you or Twilight found out the truth. [sighs] I'm sorry I wasn't honest with you. I'll just wing my way back to Griffonstone. Thanks for trying.\nApple Bloom: You don't need to apologize for carin' about how other ponies are feelin'.\nSweetie Belle: I'm just sorry we couldn't come through for you.\nScootaloo: Hmmm... Maybe we can. Gabby, clean up and meet us at the Crusaders' clubhouse!\n\n[door opens]\nGabby: I know you all tried your very best, but I guess griffons and cutie marks just don't mix. Maybe... I don't even have a special purpose.\nScootaloo: Hang on a second. We were racking our brains trying to figure out your destiny, until we remembered how every time you did something new, you tried to help everypony around you.\nSweetie Belle: Even us. How did it feel when you showed up with that fake mark, and the three of us thought we'd actually helped you?\nGabby: Well... I was really glad I helped you feel happier.\nScootaloo: So maybe helping is your thing! You might even say it's your purpose!\nGabby: But helping just feels good. I-It couldn't have anything to do with what I'm supposed to do with my life... right?\nScootaloo: Gabby, finding your special purpose doesn't have to be about being good at something. It's about feeling good about something inside.\nApple Bloom: And it looks like your destiny is a whole lot like ours \u2013 helping others. And you don't need a symbol on your flank to know that.\nSweetie Belle: But since we are the Cutie Mark Crusaders, we made you one anyway. Behold!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Your very own cutie mark! Ta-da!\nScootaloo: We carved it to mark the moment we all figured out what you should do with your life.\nGabby: But they look just like yours. You can't mean...! [gasps]\nScootaloo: You bet we do! You're one of us now! Gabby, today we dub thee...\nCutie Mark Crusaders: The very first griffon member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders! Woo-hoo!\nSweetie Belle: You may not be able to get a cutie mark...\nApple Bloom: But you're selflessly dedicatin' your life to helpin' others anyhow. I can't think of anything more Crusader-y than that.\n\nGabby: Awesome! My very own cute-cea\u00f1era!\n[chatter in background]\nApple Bloom: Oh, land sakes! You sure have earned it.\nSweetie Belle: And so have we! Scootaloo, you're pretty amazing. Even though things looked bleak, you still found a way to help Gabby in the end.\nScootaloo: 'Course! Helping's what we do, right?\nGabby: [laughing] I am so grateful! I'm gonna go home and do my very, very best to bring Cutie Mark Crusader values to Griffonstone! I promise.\nScootaloo: Promise us one other thing, too?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Come back soon!\nScootaloo: After all, you're a Crusader now.

I'm just about to do my rounds and check on my friends who work here.\nFluttershy: [hushed] We do have a friendship problem to find.\nApplejack: Lead the way, Mr. Gladmane!\nGladmane: Just Gladmane now, you hear?\n\nTrapeze Star: [gasps] Gladmane, you're just in time to see my newest move!\nGladmane: New moves or not, I'm glad to have a star like you working for me, I'll tell you what.\nTrapeze Star: Oh, don't make me blush! Now watch this!\nGladmane: Stellar! Uh-huh-huh!\nDirector: Oh! Oh! Monsieur Gladmane himself is here! Let's run through the whole routine!\nGladmane: Now, don't make a fuss for ol' me. I'm just gonna keep on giving a tour to my new friends Applejack and Fluttershy.\nApplejack: Howdy!\nFluttershy: Hi.\nDirector: If zis pony calls you friend, you're welcome backstage anytime! I owe him my entire career.\nGladmane: Aw, shucks. Well, let's leave the artists to their work.\nApplejack: [hushed] Doesn't look like there's any friendship problems here.\nFluttershy: [gasps] I've never seen a pink prairie dog before!\n[prairie dog squeaking]\nGladmane: I like the folks that come here to have a unique experience. Uh-huh-huh.\n\"Roar Horn\": Und we love him for it!\n\"Sprigfield\": With Gladmane's help, we've been able to take care of all these little guys!\nFluttershy: Now this place is overwhelming in a good way!\nGladmane: Aw, glad you like it.\nApplejack: [clears throat] Fluttershy?\nFluttershy: Hmm? Oh, um, coming!\n\nFluttershy: There doesn't seem to be anything wrong around here at all.\nApplejack: I figured lookin' for a friendship problem in Las Pegasus would be like tryin' to find a needle in a stack of needles. But everypony seems to be gettin' along just fine.\nFlim: Ladies and gentleponies, despite what my competition might say, I know you've come to this fair city to be entertained, and I assure you there is nothing more entertaining than the astounding acrobatics in Gladmane's Pone Fantastique!\nFlam: Now, I suppose that might be true if it weren't for the existence, and far superiorly entertaining presence, of the show-stopping exotic animal act that Pone Fantastique includes!\nFluttershy: Those voices sound familiar.\nApplejack: They sure do. Flim and Flam.\nFlim: Why, I won't even dignify that assertion with a response! Except to say that if you were to consider buying your tickets from me, I might consider offering them to you at a substantial discount!\nFlam: But I've always thought you get what you pay for, and in my humble opinion, these tickets are a value at twice the price!\nFlim: Don't let this price-gouging charlatan take you for a ride!\nFlam: [gasps] Charlatan? How dare you!\nFlim: Hah! How dare I?!\nFlam: [simultaneous] Yes, how dare you! I was the one that...\nFlim: [simultaneous] I call 'em likes I see them, dear brother of mine!\nFlam: [simultaneous, background] I'm two minutes older than you \u2013 don't you forget that, brother of mine!\nFlim: [simultaneous, background] I'm sick and tired of this...\nFlim and Flam: [further unintelligible arguing]\nFluttershy: They certainly don't seem to be getting along. [gasps] You don't suppose we've been brought here to help them?\nApplejack: Absolutely not!\n\nFlim and Flam: [arguing]\nFluttershy: I know you and the rest of the Apple family have had your issues with Flim and Flam in the past, but they're definitely having trouble, and solving a friendship problem is important, no matter who's having it.\nApplejack: Well, of course that's true... for anypony but them!\nGladmane: I'm sorry you had to see that. I don't know why, but those two have been fightin' ever since they got here. I thought giving them these jobs might help, but I... I guess it just made matters worse.\nApplejack: Trust me. I know those ponies, and you're better off with them apart. The two of them together will cheat the hooves right out from under you!\nGladmane: Yeah, I suppose you're right. Flim's such a showpony, and Flam has such a head for business. Why, if they ever did work together, they'd be running this place in two shakes! Ah, speaking of which, I'd better get back to work. Y'all enjoy your stay now, you hear?\nFluttershy: I'm pretty sure we should help Flim and Flam...\nApplejack: And I'm pretty sure there's another friendship problem here, and I'm gonna search this resort top to bottom 'til I find it!\nFluttershy: [sighs]\n\nFlim: I hope you didn't travel all the way from Ponyville to try to get me to reconcile with my no-account brother.\n\nFlam: Brother? I don't believe I have one of those.\n\nFlim: No! I already know what he thinks of me! All show and no substance! Well, if he's so smart, he should have no trouble becoming a big success on his own!\n\nFlam: \"Ooh, why, he's the greatest salespony that ever lived, of course!\" Just ask him. He'll tell you all about it.\n\nFluttershy: I'm sure you could work out your differences if you just sat down and talked to each other.\nFlim and Flam: I'm never speaking to that pony again!\nFluttershy: [sighs]\n\n[general casino chatter and noises]\nDirector: [muffled] No! [normal] You are ruining my show!\nTrapeze Star: It isn't just your show, and I'm improving it.\nDirector: You don't pull a rabbit out of a hat on the trapeze!\nTrapeze Star: That's the point \u2013 to give the audience something they've never seen before! Acrobatic magic!\n[twirling]\nBernard Rabbit: Ta-da!\nTrapeze Star: It's called \"blending genres\", and it's awesome!\nApplejack: Shouldn't somepony do somethin'?\n\"Back Stage\": Hah. They've been doing this since they started working here. Too bad, really. If they ever stopped shouting at each other, we could take the show on tour. They'd be way more successful than staying at Gladmane's.\nApplejack: Heh-heh. Now that sounds like a real friendship problem!\n\"Roar Horn\": Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!\n\"Sprigfield\": Stop! What are you doing?! It's supposed to be a pink prairie dog pyramid! It's alliterative!\n\"Roar Horn\": Wha\u2014 You said a tower! Why do you keep changing everything?\n[prairie dogs squeaking]\n\"Sprigfield\": I'm not changing anything! You said pyramid!\n\"Roar Horn\": [shrieks] You are driving me crazy!\nApplejack: I thought you two got along.\n\"Sprigfield\": We used to, but we just can't seem to agree on anything anymore. We used to perform all over Equestria, but if we can't agree on a new act, we might as well stay at Gladmane's forever. [stomping]\nApplejack: Two friendship problems in the same theater? Now we're talkin'!\n\nFluttershy: If you count Flim and Flam, that's three big friendship problems all in the same place!\nApplejack: Well, I don't count Flim and Flam since those two not bein' friends isn't a problem.\nFluttershy: It certainly isn't for Gladmane. Sounds like he's better off with them fighting.\nApplejack: Actually, the other ponies' problems seemed to be good for Gladmane too. Both the trapeze show and the animal act would be better off if they left, but everypony's so busy arguin' that they can't.\nFluttershy: Do you think he knows?\nApplejack: I don't know, but I'm startin' to think we should find out.\n\nTrapeze Star: Of course Gladmane wants everypony to get along. He's the nicest, most genuine pony I've ever met. Did the director put you up to this?\nBernard Rabbit: [unintelligible whispering]\n\nDirector: I tell you, if Gladmane is your friend, you are welcome backstage. But if you are speaking of him poorly, you leave!\n\n\"Roar Horn\": Gladmane is the kindest, most gentle...\n\"Sprigfield\": ...most compassionate pony I've ever known!\n\"Roar Horn\" and \"Sprigfield\": My problem... is with him!\n[prairie dogs squeaking]\n\nApplejack: I just can't figure it! The only pony who benefits from all this feudin' is Gladmane, but by all accounts, he's the best friend any of these ponies have!\nFluttershy: Well, Bernard \u2013 that adorable bunny from the acrobat's act \u2013 claims that every morning, Gladmane tells the director that the star wants control of the show, and every afternoon tells the star that the director wants to get rid of her! But neither is true!\nApplejack: [snorts]\nFluttershy: And the Flying Prairinos \u2013 the pink prairie dog family \u2013 say Gladmane keeps changing their act to make each trainer think the other is doing it!\nApplejack: So all his talk about friendship is just a load of applesauce! He's gettin' them all to fight with each other on purpose!\nFluttershy: But how can we get everypony to believe that's what he's doing?\nApplejack: There must be a way to trick him into telling the truth!\nFluttershy: Gee, if only there was a pony who knew how to trick a trickster.\nFlim and Flam: [unintelligible arguing]\nFluttershy: Or maybe a pair of ponies?\nApplejack: [sighs] Fine. Guess bringin' Flim and Flam back together might be why we're here. Maybe.\n\nFlim: Sorry if I don't take the word of somepony off the street, even if that street is in Ponyville.\nFluttershy: But Gladmane is behind so many other friendship problems. How can you be sure he isn't the cause of yours?\nFlam: Because the only problem I have is standing right there.\nFlim: Same here, buster!\nApplejack: Do either of you even know what you're fightin' over?\nFlim: Gladmane let me know that ex-brother of mine thinks I'm just a mouthpiece without a single good idea!\nFlam: Gladmane assured me this former fraternal foal here thinks I couldn't sell heat lamps to yaks!\nApplejack: Sounds to me like neither of you said those things. Why'd you believe Gladmane when he said you did?\nFlim: Why would he lie?\nFluttershy: Because he's afraid that the two of you together could move in and take over his resort.\nApplejack: And if I'm tellin' you he said it, you know it's the absolute truth because\u2014\nFlim and Flam: You never lie!\nFlam: Oh, brother of mine, I think it's time for a little payback!\nFlim: The Canterlot Two-Step?\nFlam: Mmm, we don't have the chickens. How about the Baltimare Flare?\nFlim: Ah, my flare isn't what it used to be.\nGladmane: [over loudspeaker] Listen here, y'all! If you're a friend of mine, you're entitled to a free night's stay, and everypony is a friend of mine! Thank you. Thank you very much.\nFlim: Are you thinking what I am?\nFlam: The High Roller Hustle!\nApplejack: The what now?\nFlam: Trust us. When we're done, there won't be a pony in town who doesn't know the Applejack-iest truth about Gladmane! That is, assuming you two are willing to help.\nFlim: What size gown do you wear?\n\n[crowd chattering and cameras clicking]\nGladmane: Wh-What's all the fuss, now?\nFlim: It's the grand matriarch of the Rich family, Impossibly Rich! She's one of the wealthiest ponies in Equestria.\nGladmane: Well, why didn't somepony tell me? You know how I like to give VIP guests my personal touch.\nFlim: Well, she's not exactly a guest. Word is she's planning a resort of her own. [hushed] I think she's here to scout the competition.\nGladmane: [hushed] Oh, really?\nFlim: And with her bits, she could take over the whole strip, hire away anypony she wants!\nGladmane: [growling]\nFlim: Uh, not me, of course! I love it here. My good-for-nothing brother, on the other hoof...\nGladmane: [snorts] Impossibly Rich, what an honor it is to have you at my humble five-hoof resort. I'm sure Flam has done an excellent job showing you around, but nothing could beat a personalized tour from the mane himself. Uh-huh-huh.\nFluttershy: [unintelligible whispering]\nFlam: You'll have to excuse Ms. Rich. She saves the energy other ponies spend talking out loud and uses it to make more money.\nFluttershy: [unintelligible whispering]\nFlam: She'd love a personal tour! Say, in, uh, about an hour?\nGladmane: Well, that sounds right pleasant. And if you can break away for a moment, Flam, I'd love to see you in my office so I can get ready.\n[curtain rustling]\nFluttershy: Are all of you sure this is a good idea?\nFlim: Abso-tively!\nFlam: Gladmane is one fish that's hooked but good!\nApplejack: I sure hope you two know what you're doin'.\nFlam: Oho, don't you worry. When it comes to throwing ponies off their game...\nFlim: No two ponies do it better than us!\nApplejack: Can't argue with that.\n\n[door opens]\nFlam: Hey there, boss, Impossibly Rich is just about ready for that tour. So what did you want to see me about?\nGladmane: Actually, there's something I want you to see \u2013 the Grand Plan. Every hotel on this strip as amazing as this one, and every one of 'em mine.\nFlam: [whistles]\nGladmane: And all it'll take is a little salesponyship, like this.\n[click]\nGladmane: [over loudspeaker] Hey there, friends. Uh-huh-huh. If you think my resort is fantastic, wait 'til you see Pone Fantastique! Tickets are on sale now. Two for the price of one! Thank you. Thank you very much.\n[click]\nGladmane: Now I know Impossibly Rich has probably made you a tempting offer to come work for her.\nFlam: Well uh, now that you mention it...\nGladmane: And as your friend, I'd never tell you what to do. But nopony's gonna stand in the way of my plans, no matter how rich she is! And I sure wouldn't want you to end up on the losing side. Think you might consider staying here?\nFlam: Um...\nGladmane: Well all right then.\n\nApplejack: They're comin'!\nGladmane: And last but not least, Ms. Rich, the jewel in my crown.\nFluttershy: [unintelligible whispering]\nFlam: Impossibly wants you to know she's very impressed but doesn't think you can keep a resort of this caliber going for long.\nGladmane: Oh? And why's that?\nFluttershy: [unintelligible whispering]\nFlam: Because you've got the best talents in the industry. What stops them from just leaving to join any competitor?\nGladmane: [laughs] Well, you see I have a trick for that, I must confess. Uh-huh-huh. And it all has to do [also over loudspeaker] with how I handle my employees.\nFlam: And how is that?\nGladmane: [also over loudspeaker] Well, like friends, of course! And I treat every one of my employees with the kindness they deserve.\nFlam: [stammering] That's it? That's your secret, heh-heh? There's... [clears throat] ...nothing else?\nGladmane: Nope, just friendship. But you know all about friendship, don't you... Fluttershy?!\nFlim: You knew the whole time?\nGladmane: Never try to con a con-pony. Uh-huh-huh. [laughs] Yeah!\n\n[bits jingling]\n[door opens]\nGladmane: I'd have thought you'd have hit the road by now.\nFluttershy: Whether we were able to fool you or not, you can't just go on keeping ponies from getting along! It's just... mean!\nGladmane: Now, maybe it is. But it's a meanness that works. Unlike your pathetic little ploy. I practically invented the \"High Roller Hustle\". But I suppose I should be impressed. You're the only ponies to ever figure out the secret to my success. Takes a lot of work keepin' everypony fightin'. But as long as I keep 'em convinced that I'm their only friend, all of Las Pegasus will be mine. Oh, you can't trick a confession out of a pony like me! I'm always one step ahead.\nApplejack: Well, you better check your hooves, because you've just stepped in a confession!\nGladmane: Oh, no. No, no, w-w-wait, wait!\nFluttershy: [over loudspeaker] Did that sound okay?\nFlim and Flam: Never better!\nApplejack: [over loudspeaker] Flim and Flam told us you'd see right through the fake rich pony bit, and that once you did, you wouldn't be able to resist gloatin' about it! This was all part of the plan!\nGladmane: Oh, now, now, friends! Listen, I-I can explain everything!\nDirector: I think you've done enough of that! Darling?\nTrapeze Star: Hmph!\n\"Roar Horn\": Oh, I cannot believe we let him almost ruin our friendship!\n\"Sprigfield\": And our act. Good luck finding another one!\nGladmane: Wait! No! Y'all come back! Come on, I-I'm gonna be ruined! This is Gladmane's, y'all! Come on, you can't do this to... [wailing trails off]\nApplejack: Gladmane has left the buildin'!\n\n[crunching, crash]\nFluttershy: I guess the map wasn't on the fritz after all.\n[cutie marks ringing]\nFluttershy: If it weren't for your history with Flim and Flam, you never would've been so determined to find somepony else to help, and we never would have found out what Gladmane was doing.\nApplejack: And if it weren't for you wantin' to show even those two con-ponies kindness, we never would have been able to trick the trickster. [to Flim and Flam] Must've felt pretty nice to finally put all your connivin' and cheatin' skills to good use.\nFlam: In fact, we might think of it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\nFlim: Emphasis on \"once\".\nFluttershy: [suspiciously] What do you mean?\nFlam: [over loudspeaker] While this establishment undergoes a slight change in management, my brother and I want to assure you that it remains the pinnacle of Las Pegasus entertainment! Which is why we invite each and every one of you to experience the wonder of the Pone Fantastique Theater \u2013 at half the normal cost of admission!\nFlim: [over loudspeaker] And while you're appreciating this historic venue totally devoid of any performers of any kind, we invite you to use the wonder of your own imaginations to fill the space at no additional charge!\n[crowd excited chattering]\nApplejack: Flim and Flam!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[doors open]\nStarlight Glimmer: [yawns]\nTwilight Sparkle: [yawns] I've prepared a full day of spells. You've been doing great, but now it's time for a real challenge!\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh-ho-ho! It is on! Where do we begin?\nTwilight Sparkle: Teleportation! Multiple locations! Try to keep up!\n[teleportation zaps]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Transfiguration!\n[zap]\n[chick chirping]\n[zaps]\nStarlight Glimmer: [blows]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Shields!\n[zaps]\n[explosion]\nStarlight Glimmer: Whoo! I am on fire! What's next?\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe there is such a thing as too much studying.\n[crash]\n\n[theme song]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: As you know, speed spells like Accelero are not easy. But if done correctly, they can allow you to be much more efficient with your day.\n[whooshing]\nSpike: Way to go, Starlight!\nStarlight Glimmer: [laughing] I'm not finished. I've discovered a very old spell, Similo Duplexis, when combined with Accelero in just the right way... [doubled up] ...you can literally be in two places at once! [normal] [sighs] Now I'm finished.\nTwilight Sparkle: I have to admit, your skills with magic really are nothing short of amazing. I'm very impressed.\nStarlight Glimmer: [laughing] I've always been something of a natural.\nTwilight Sparkle: However, it doesn't look like you've tackled any friendship lessons since you met Trixie.\nStarlight Glimmer: Are you sure? I could've sworn there were a couple in there somewhere...\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sure.\nStarlight Glimmer: I see... Well, I'm really quite busy this week. So many commitments. I'll try and find some time in my\u2014\n[magic zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: No time like the present! Spike and I are headed to Canterlot. Princess Celestia wanted me to give her students a quick overview on the history of enchanted objects in Equestria. We'll be back after the presentation, which should be...\nSpike: Twenty moons from now?\nTwilight Sparkle: Tonight. It's a quick presentation.\nSpike: [to himself] Sure, keep telling yourself that...\nTwilight Sparkle: You can tackle a friendship lesson today, and we can review your progress when I get back later this evening.\nStarlight Glimmer: [nervously] Of course! No problem! Friendship lesson... On it...\nTwilight Sparkle: Great! Can't wait. Now, Spike, help me color-code these cards according to time, place, and object.\nSpike: [sighs]\n\n[knocking]\n[clicking]\n[door opens]\nStarlight Glimmer: Huh? Huh! [humming and muttering to self] Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.\nSpike: Hey! Twilight and I are about to head to Canterlot. Just checking to see if you need anything before we left.\nStarlight Glimmer: Nope, not at all! I'm good here. Oh, not good \u2013 great! Not a problem in the world! Heh.\nSpike: [disbelieving] Uh-huh. So... what are you doing, exactly?\nStarlight Glimmer: I... was... just trying to decide which friendship lesson I was going to tackle while you two were in Canterlot. Bap-ba-du... Oh, yep, right here, where I just left them a second ago.\nSpike: [blows] [reading] \"Bake a cake with Pinkie Pie,\" \"scrapbook with Applejack,\" \"sew with Rarity...\"\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans]\nSpike: \"Help an animal with Fluttershy,\" \"chillax with Rainbow Dash?\" What is chillaxing?\nStarlight Glimmer: No idea.\nSpike: You know, uh, if you're nervous about your friendship lessons, it's totally okay to say so.\nStarlight Glimmer: Nervous, me? [fake laughter] Oh, Spike, you really are hilarious, ha-ha. You think I'm nervous that I'm gonna fail something as simple as baking a cake?\nSpike: Well, if you were, it'd be\u2014\nStarlight Glimmer: Silly! Twilight just said how impressed she was that I combined a speed spell and a duplication spell. That was a challenge. These? Pfft, hah! I could combine all five of these at the same time without breaking a sweat.\nSpike: I think maybe you're missing\u2014\nStarlight Glimmer: An opportunity to really impress Twilight? [gasps] Great idea, Spike! I'm gonna get right on that! Good talk.\nSpike: And I thought Twilight was the master of the freak-out.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: So, with your help, I figure these should be done in no time.\nApplejack: Are you sure this is what Twilight would want? Seems like you might want to take your time with each of these.\nStarlight Glimmer: But by working as a team, we can get them done faster. And isn't teamwork a key factor in friendship?\nApplejack: I... guess.\nStarlight Glimmer: Super! Pinkie Pie, since we're baking, you will be in the kitchen.\nPinkie Pie: [inhales]\nStarlight Glimmer: Rarity, Applejack, you two can set up in the library.\nRarity: Oh, I don't know that a dusty old library has the proper lighting. Perhaps we can stay out here in the foyer.\nStarlight Glimmer: I thought that Fluttershy and I could work with the animals right here in the foyer.\nFluttershy: Oh, um, whatever you think is best.\nStarlight Glimmer: Great. Now, Rainbow Dash\u2014\nFluttershy: It might depend on the animal. For instance, this poor little eagle with a sprained wing might be better off up in one of the towers.\nStarlight Glimmer: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.\nFluttershy: And these adorable little chipmunks might prefer a nook somewhere. Maybe if you spend some time getting to know\u2014\nStarlight Glimmer: In a minute, Fluttershy.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, I don't know if we can chillax properly in the castle. We need very specific conditions for optimal chillaxing.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, I just assumed chillaxing could happen anywhere.\nRainbow Dash: Heh. Shows what you know about chillaxing. Let me do some location scouting.\n[whoosh]\nStarlight Glimmer: Okay... It seemed more efficient to start with the scrapbooking, so we can just get it out of the\u2014\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh! Can we start with me? We're gonna need time for the cake to bake! After all...\nIt's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake\u2014\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, we're on a schedule, no time for a song. We can start with baking, then\u2014\nRarity: But we can't design dresses after you've been baking with Pinkie. [hushed] She can be a bit messy.\n[squidge]\nPinkie Pie: Mmm!\nStarlight Glimmer: Fine. We can start with the dresses, and then\u2014\nApplejack: While y'all figure that out, I'm gonna start layin' out the pictures for scrapbookin'. We got a whole lot of time to cover.\nStarlight Glimmer: How much is a whole lot?\nApplejack: We've got at least eighty moons worth of memories to go through.\nStarlight Glimmer: Eighty moons?!\nRainbow Dash: Ugh. There is nowhere to chillax in this castle! We're gonna have to set up somewhere else.\nRainbow Dash, Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie: [overlapped argument]\nStarlight Glimmer: Could you all excuse me for... one... second?\n[whoosh]\nRainbow Dash: Wow. That pony really needs to chillax.\n\nIt's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake\u2014\n\n[door opens]\nStarlight Glimmer: [hyperventilating] Okay, Starlight. You've got this. A handful of friendship lessons is nothing compared to the spells you've mastered. [nervous laugh] Maybe if I cast a little spell to help things along... Something simple and safe. Fiducia Compelus... That's not bad. They would barely notice it, but... is it enough? Oh... Maybe Cogeria so they're more... open to suggestion. Oh, or maybe Cogeria combined with Fiducia Compelus! Yes, that could work nicely! Oh, with a hint of Persuadere to be sure it sticks.\n[magic zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Everypony'll probably thank me for getting it all done so quickly. And Twilight will be thrilled I've completed so many lessons. Everypony wins!\n[magic zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Congratulations, Starlight. You're a genius. [gasps] Maybe the congratulations were a little premature...\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Cogeria... Persuadere... Fiducia... Hmm. Ah! Of course! Fiducia Compelus needs a trigger. [amplified] Ponies! Hear my voice and listen!\n[magic zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Pinkie, kitchen. Rarity, Applejack, library. Fluttershy, stay here. Rainbow Dash, find somewhere inside the castle and set up a place where we can chillax.\nRainbow Dash, Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie: [overlapped agreement]\n\n[door opens]\nStarlight Glimmer: Let's get to work, Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie: [mechanically] Okie-dokie! What would you like to do first?\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, what are we supposed to do first?\nPinkie Pie: [mechanically] Whatever you want to do first, Starlight Glimmer.\nStarlight Glimmer: [reading] In a medium-size mixing bowl, beat together eggs, sugar, and two teaspoons of vanilla... [beat] mix in flour... [beat] [quickly] add baking soda, salt and cinnamon! Hmm. I think you can take it from here.\nPinkie Pie: [mechanically] Take what from where?\nStarlight Glimmer: The baking. Just keep following the instructions in the book until I get back.\nPinkie Pie: [mechanically] Abso-tively! Instruction following starting... now!\nStarlight Glimmer: Baking a cake \u2013 check! Now on to sewing!\n[door closes]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: What did you have in mind, Rarity?\nRarity: [mechanically] Whatever you want me to have in my mind, Starlight Glimmer.\nStarlight Glimmer: Can you make a dress exactly like that one?\nRarity: [mechanically] Just like this one?\nStarlight Glimmer: Just like it.\nRarity: [mechanically] Absolutely. It will look perfectly divine.\nStarlight Glimmer: That's a whole lot of photos. How do you usually organize them?\nApplejack: [mechanically] However you want me to organize them, Starlight.\nStarlight Glimmer: Okay. Tell me about this one.\nApplejack: [mechanically] Sweet Apple Acres, twenty moons ago. Granny Smith was lookin' for her favorite pie tin. She looked in the kitchen, but it wasn't there. She looked in the barn, but it wasn't there.\nStarlight Glimmer: Ugh. I don't need every little detail. Heh. Just sum up the story in one sentence.\nApplejack: [mechanically] Huh. Turns out Granny Smith didn't know how to make a pig do the backstroke.\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh-huh... Why don't you keep putting these photos in chronological order, and when I come back, you can give me more... highlights?\nApplejack: [mechanically] Sure thing, Starlight Glimmer.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Fluttershy, where are all the animals?\nFluttershy: [mechanically] They ran away.\nStarlight Glimmer: And why didn't you stop them?\nFluttershy: [mechanically] Because you didn't ask me to.\nStarlight Glimmer: Obviously I wanted you to... Never mind. Can you please round up all the animals in the castle and bring them back here to the foyer?\nFluttershy: [mechanically] All the animals. Got it.\nStarlight Glimmer: Did you find a place to chillax, Rainbow Dash?\nRainbow Dash: [mechanically] Sure thing, Starlight Glimmer!\nStarlight Glimmer: Great. Let me know when it's ready.\nRainbow Dash: [mechanically] Yes, Starlight Glimmer.\n\nApplejack: [mechanically] Granny Smith knew she was gonna need a bigger boat, so Goldie Delicious says, \"If you can't say anythin' nice about anypony, come sit by me!\" Big Mac knew if he just covered himself in mud, the creature wouldn't be able to see him!\nRarity: [mechanically] Starlight Glimmer. I have finished the dress. Isn't it gorgeous?\nStarlight Glimmer: What is that?\nRarity: [mechanically] You wanted me to make a dress exactly like the one in the book.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] Go make a real dress out of fabric, exactly like the one in the book.\nRarity: [mechanically] Ah. I see. Yes, of course, Starlight Glimmer.\n[beat]\nStarlight Glimmer: Rarity! Make it bigger than the one in the book.\nRarity: [mechanically] Of course, darling. Bigger it is.\n[mouse squeaks]\n\nApplejack: [mechanically] She was just a pony standin' in front of another pony askin' him to love her.\n\n[door opens]\n[crash]\nStarlight Glimmer: Pinkie, what are you doing?!\nPinkie Pie: [mechanically] Following all of the instructions in the cookbook in order, Starlight Glimmer!\nStarlight Glimmer: I meant just the one cake! I was only gone a few minutes! How in Equestria did you get all of this done so fast?\nPinkie Pie: [mechanically] First, I combined three eggs, then I\u2014 [muffled noises]\nStarlight Glimmer: Think the baking lesson is done.\nHarry: [growling]\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, what now?\n[oven crackling]\n\nApplejack: [mechanically] They can take our farm, but they can't take our freedom!\nStarlight Glimmer: What's going on?!\nHarry: [growls]\nFluttershy: [mechanically] I gathered all of the animals like you asked, Starlight Glimmer.\n[thud]\nRarity: [mechanically] Oh, yes, this will do nicely.\n[thud]\nRarity: [mechanically] A much bigger dress!\nApplejack: [mechanically, muffled] It was the best of apples, it was the worst of apples...\nStarlight Glimmer: [exhales] I can handle this. It's just magic, and I know magic. What's that?!\nPinkie Pie: [muffled noises]\nStarlight Glimmer: What did you say?\nPinkie Pie: [mechanically] The cakes are burning. You left the ovens on.\nStarlight Glimmer: We need water!\nRainbow Dash: [mechanically] Yes, Starlight Glimmer.\nStarlight Glimmer: Storm clouds?!\n[thunder rolling]\nHarry: [confused noise]\n[splashing]\nApplejack: [mechanically] Big Mac told me, \"With a whole lot of power comes a heck of a lot of responsibility.\"\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans] This can't get any worse!\nTwilight Sparkle: What is going on?!\n\n[spider squeaks]\n[brushing]\nSpike: I had no idea we had spiders in the castle! I'm never sleeping again!\nStarlight Glimmer: Maybe if I had reversed the Fiducia Compelus and Cogeria... Or maybe I added too much Persuadere... What?\nSpike: You're really missing the point here.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] I finally untangled that mess of a spell and got everypony home. It was really powerful stuff. They're gonna feel that in the morning. Now please try to explain to me how in the name of Celestia things got this out of control.\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, it was the first time I cast that particular spell, and I didn't fully think it through. I-I bet if I had reversed\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: I think you might be missing the point here.\nSpike: Told ya.\nTwilight Sparkle: What made you think that casting a spell on your friends to do your bidding was even remotely a good idea?\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, when you put it that way, it sounds really bad.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's because it is really bad!\nStarlight Glimmer: [stammering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight, I'm not mad at you, but I am disappointed. You've been doing so well. I just don't understand how a friendship lesson turned into all of this.\nStarlight Glimmer: Ugh, fine! I've been avoiding the friendship lessons on purpose.\nTwilight Sparkle: Why?\nStarlight Glimmer: I can cast complex spells, but baking a cake with Pinkie Pie freaks me out! And yes, I know how ridiculous that sounds. That's why I didn't say anything. I thought if I just kept wowing you with my magical abilities, you might just... not... notice?\nTwilight Sparkle: Baking a cake freaks you out?\nStarlight Glimmer: Yes! Baking a cake, sewing \u2013 all of it! What if I was bad at it? I didn't want to be a disappointment to anypony, and I ended up being a disappointment to everypony.\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight, do you think anypony cares if you can bake a cake?\nStarlight Glimmer: But the lesson\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: Was to get to know Pinkie Pie better by doing something she loves. It was a friendship lesson, not a baking lesson.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh. You know, I think I might have missed the point here.\nSpike: Told ya.\nStarlight Glimmer: So now what?\nTwilight Sparkle: Now it's time for a pretty advanced friendship lesson. It's called apologizing.\n\nApplejack: [groaning] I don't know what kind of whammy Starlight put on us, but I feel like I got shoved through the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000.\nRainbow Dash: Ugh, tell me about it.\nRarity: [hushed] If everypony could speak in a whisper for the next few days, that would be delightful. My head is thumping...!\nFluttershy: [tired] I was up all night calming the animals down.\nRarity: [hushed] Fluttershy, please! Not so loud...\nPinkie Pie: Starlight's spell made me burn perfectly good cake! I never burn cake!\nStarlight Glimmer: Yeah, about that... Things got a little out of hand last night.\nApplejack: Well, ain't that the understatement of the day.\nPinkie Pie: Hmph! Tell it to the cake, sister!\nRarity: [hushed] Can we all please argue at a lower volume?\nStarlight Glimmer: I really messed up. I cast the spell because I was nervous about working with you on the friendship lessons.\nRainbow Dash: Well, here's a friendship lesson for ya \u2014 don't cast spells on your friends!\nStarlight Glimmer: Believe me, I know. What I did was wrong, a-and I can't take it back. You're right to be upset, and I hope one day I can make it up to you. But all I can say is... I'm sorry. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go clean the castle covered in wet cake batter and spiders.\nRainbow Dash: That was a pretty good apology.\nFluttershy: Seems like she feels pretty bad.\nApplejack: Hey, Starlight! Most of the Apple family photos are still layin' around in the wreckage. I think I'll come along and hunt 'em down.\nFluttershy: Oh, and I feel awful for disturbing all of those cute little spiders and bats. I should check on them.\nRarity: Ah, yes, and I left some lovely fabric out. I should come and move it to that nice quiet library.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, I'll come and get those storm clouds out of the bathroom.\nPinkie Pie: Fine! Somepony has to bake a cake to honor all the poor cakes that sacrificed their batter in last night's tragedy!\n\n[montage music]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: It seems your apology went well.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] I'm just lucky to have such understanding friends, but it's probably going to be a while before I try to tackle those friendship lessons again.\nTwilight Sparkle: What do you mean? You've been doing them all day.\nStarlight Glimmer: What are you talking about? I've been cleaning up the mess I made by totally failing at friendship.\nTwilight Sparkle: Really? But didn't I see you sewing with Rarity?\nStarlight Glimmer: Yes, but\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: And you and Applejack did a great job collecting those photos and putting them in the book. Helping animals with Fluttershy, baking with Pinkie Pie \u2013 those sound like your assignments to me. In fact, I think there's just one that you're missing.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Sun \u2013 check. Chairs \u2013 check. And thanks to a simple Catadupa Levitata spell, we've got water. Is that everything we need to chillax?\nRainbow Dash: Nope.\nStarlight Glimmer: No? What did I miss?\nRainbow Dash: Quiet.\nStarlight Glimmer: Ah! Right.\nTwilight Sparkle: Great job, Starlight. Looks like you've completed another friendship lesson. [sighs]\nRainbow Dash: Hey! She completes the lesson when I say she completes it. So less learning and more chillaxing!\n[beat]\nStarlight Glimmer: So... How long do we sit quietly?\nMain cast: [laughing]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[birds chirping]\nSpike: [panting] Twilight, can you slow down a bit? [sighs]\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry, Spike. It's just Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Applejack are getting back from their Seaward Shoals boat trip, and I can't wait to hear all about it! It's such a shame Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to miss it for their Cloudsdale flight school reunion. Maybe the rest of us not going was for the best anyway. I know the three of them were really looking forward to getting out of their element.\nSpike: Getting out of their element?\nTwilight Sparkle: I think they all just wanted to try something new.\nSpike: Huh. I guess a boat trip qualifies as that.\nTwilight Sparkle: My only worry is that they'll be so excited, they'll talk over each other, and I'll miss some of the details! Just to be safe, I may need you to take notes.\n[train chuffing]\nSpike: Uh... right.\n[train brakes hiss]\nTwilight Sparkle: So how was the trip?\nApplejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie: [grunting]\nSpike: Well, at least you don't have to worry about them talking over each other.\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know what happened on that boat trip. But once Rarity, Applejack, and Pinkie Pie have some tea and talk it out, I'm sure everypony will feel better.\n[splash]\nSpike: [snap]\n[knocking]\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on in, everypony! Gummy, Opalescence, and Winona? This is a surprise!\nSpike: Aren't Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Applejack with you?\nOpalescence: [purring]\nTwilight Sparkle: [reading] \"Sorry, darling, but I must decline the invitation to your soiree. While I'm sure it will be positively resplendent, there are certain ponies I'd rather not associate with at the moment. Rarity.\"\nSpike: Rarity's not coming? Awww. So I polished my scales for nothing.\nTwilight Sparkle: [reading] \"Sorry I can't make it, but I'm still a mite upset about everything that happened on the boat. Applejack.\" \"Sorry I can't make the tea party today, but there's a small problem with the guest list. Plus, I'm right in the middle of a very important cupcake. Pinkie.\" Come on, Spike! Since our friends won't come here and tell us what happened, we'll just have to go to them!\nSpike: Right behind you! [stuffing his mouth]\n\n[brushing]\nRarity: [gasps]\n[crab snapping]\nRarity: I'm sorry, but my mane wasn't made to support marine life! Ruined, completely ruined.\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know, Rarity. Maybe you could\u2014\nRarity: Throw it away? Yes, I agree. Just another innocent casualty of that disastrous boat trip.\nTwilight Sparkle: About that. Spike and I were wondering what happened out there.\nRarity: Please, darling. I don't know if I'll ever be able to discuss it. It's far too painful! [gasps dramatically]\nSpike: If it's too difficult to talk about, we completely understand.\nRarity: Well, since you dragged it out of me... It all started at the docks. I knew Applejack and Pinkie Pie wanted to get out of their element, so I thought I would surprise them with an elegant cruise.\n\nRarity: [narrating] I had brought a small bag with just a few key essentials. [in-world] All right, ponies! Prepare yourselves for luxury on the high seas!\nPinkie Pie: That sounds... fun?\nApplejack: [sea dog accent] The sea air carries a portent for trouble this day. 'Tis a treacherous and perilous journey that lies ahead of us! We sail to adventure... or our very doom.\nRarity: I... have no idea what you just said, but your wardrobe is delightfully seaworthy.\n\nRarity: [narrating] Despite Applejack's colorful seafarer attitude, I was still determined to get my friends out of their element by providing them with all the refinements of a luxury cruise. I made sure to bring the most delectable nibbles for them to enjoy.\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, I brought food too!\n[crash]\nPinkie Pie: Let's see, I've got cotton candy, taffy, circus peanuts, and lots of other super-yummy stuff!\nRarity: Oh, Pinkie Pie, that all looks positively delectable. But you simply must try one of these cucumber sandwiches. Dig in!\nPinkie Pie: Hmmm. Hmmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.\nApplejack: [sea dog accent] Arrr! Get those off me ship!\n[splash]\n[bubbling]\nRarity: Oh! I'm so sorry! I had no idea you had such distaste for cucumbers!\nApplejack: [sea dog accent] Yar-har-har-har, hardy-har-har-har!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmm... That doesn't sound like Applejack.\nSpike: Huh.\nRarity: Well, hold on, because it gets even worse. Pinkie tried to lighten the mood with some fun maritime games.\n\nPinkie Pie: It's pi\u00f1ata o'clock! Wanna give it a whack, Rarity?\nRarity: Oh, darling, of course!\n[lightning cracks]\nApplejack: [laughs in sea dog accent] I'll be chartin' a course to the very heart of that maelstrom!\nRarity: Ahem. Er, Applejack? Just a thought, but maybe we should steer the ship toward calmer waters.\nApplejack: [sea dog accent] This be the only way to Plunder Cove!\n[lightning cracks]\n[water rushing]\nRarity: Perhaps if I took a quick look-see at that map of yours, I could find us a more cruise-friendly path\u2014\nApplejack: [sea dog accent] Yah! There'll be no mutiny aboard me ship!\nPinkie Pie: Look at me! I'm the captain too!\nRarity: [narrating] Clearly, Pinkie Pie had caught Applejack's sea madness.\nApplejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity: [arguing]\n[splash]\nApplejack: [sea dog accent] Is that all you've got?! [laughs]\n[splash]\n\nSpike: Then what happened?!\nRarity: Oh, the boat sank. Obviously. [blows]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: So Applejack got some sort of sea madness and caused the boat to capsize?\nRarity: After all the effort I put in to provide her and Pinkie with the exact luxury cruise they needed to get out of their elements, that is how Applejack thanked me!\nSpike: So you were stuck out in the middle of the ocean? How in Equestria did you get back?\nRarity: [sighs] Spike, darling, you'll have to forgive me. I am far too emotionally drained to discuss the matter any further!\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity, I don't suppose there's any chance you might be... uh, exaggerating things? Just a little?\nRarity: Well! I can assure you that that is exactly what happened! But if you don't believe me, you can ask Pinkie Pie. I'm quite certain her story will be the same.\n\nPinkie Pie: So that's what Rarity said happened on the boat, huh?\n[slam]\nTwilight Sparkle: We thought there was a chance she might have... [clears throat] embellished the story just a tad. So we wanted to hear about what happened from you! Did Applejack really capsize the boat?\nPinkie Pie: Of course not! Pfft, that's just silly! There's no way Applejack could've sank the boat!\nTwilight Sparkle: I knew it!\nSpike: That's a relief.\nPinkie Pie: Because Rarity did!\nTwilight Sparkle and Spike: What?!\nPinkie Pie: It all started on the docks. I knew Rarity and Applejack wanted to get out of their element, so I figured I'd throw them the funnest, silliest boat party ever! But I guess Rarity had other ideas.\n\nPinkie Pie: [narrating] I thought I overpacked until I saw Rarity and her team of porter-ponies!\nRarity: Prepare yourselves for a luxury cruise! A day of opulence, decadence, and extravagance!\nPinkie Pie: [deadpan] That sounds fun.\nApplejack: Ahoy, mateys! Batten down the hatches, y'all, 'cause this here's gonna be a boat ride of adventure!\nPinkie Pie: Eh, I can live with that.\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: Huh. They just keep coming.\n\nPinkie Pie: [narrating] Now, you can't throw a silly boat party without snacks. So I made sure to pack the funnest party food I could find! [in-world] Rarity, would you care for some cotton candy? It's freshly spun!\nRarity: Oh, Pinkie Pie, those all look simply... well, simple. But they're obviously unfit for a luxury cruise. Now, my cucumber sandwiches, on the other hoof... Try one, then you'll understand.\nPinkie Pie: [chewing]\nApplejack: Ooh, are those chocolate chip?\n[splash]\n[bubbling]\nRarity: Sorry! Cucumber sandwiches are so ten seconds ago.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait, wait, wait. That doesn't sound like Rarity.\nPinkie Pie: Just wait until you hear how much more unlike her she sounds!\nSpike: [chewing]\nPinkie Pie: I thought I'd lighten the mood with some super-fun party boat games. But Rarity was a real wet blanket.\n\nPinkie Pie: It's pi\u00f1ata time! Ooh! Wanna give it a whack, Rarity?\nRarity: [exaggerated posh laugh] ...Oh. You were serious. Well, that's adorable.\nApplejack: I'll give it a go!\nPinkie Pie: That's the spirit! Let's get this boat party started!\n[spinning]\nApplejack: Whoooooa! Heh-heh! Whoa, doggie!\n[lightning cracks]\n[splashing]\nApplejack and Rarity: [grunting]\nPinkie Pie: Tug of war? Now we're talking! Whoever wins gets to be captain!\nApplejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity: [grunting]\nPinkie Pie: Or... one of us should just be captain now?\n[wheel rattling]\n[thud]\nRarity: Oh, don't worry, dear. Luxury cruises never sink.\nPinkie Pie: What?!\n[splash]\n\nPinkie Pie: And that's why the boat sinking was all Rarity's fault.\nTwilight Sparkle: That seems... odd. I mean, we trust you, of course. But it's all so... extraordinary?\nPinkie Pie: Oh, it's \"extraordinary\", all right. But that's exactly what happened! In fact, the only thing I might've gotten wrong was that there were even more porter ponies! But just to be safe, you should talk to Applejack. She'll know exactly how many porter ponies there were!\nSpike: Okay, but if the boat sank, how did you all get rescued?\nPinkie Pie: Oh, that's easy. We just\u2014 [sniffs] My muffins!\nSpike: [fed up] That's it. We've gotta go talk to Applejack.\nTwilight Sparkle: Good idea. She'll straighten this out.\nSpike: I just really, really wanna know how they made it back! But yeah, that'd be great too.\n\n[thwack]\n[apples falling]\nApplejack: Hold on a tick. Pinkie Pie says it's Rarity's fault, and Rarity says I sank the boat? Well, that's plumb crazy! If you two really wanna know what happened, I'll tell you. Y'all know how Pinkie Pie and Rarity wanted to get out of their \"element\"? Well, I bought a treasure map to give 'em a rip-roarin' seafarin' adventure! But they had other ideas.\n\nRarity: La-la-la! Prepare yourselves for the most luxurious boat outing that ever outed a boat!\nPinkie Pie: And more fun than you can shake a stick at! [squee] Because I brought a stick!\nApplejack: Alright, mateys, but just y'all wait 'til you see the high seas adventure I've got planned!\n[paper rolling]\n\nApplejack: [narrating] Unfortunately, they seemed less interested in a treasure huntin' adventure and more interested in snacks.\nRarity: Oh, darling, that food isn't fit for a pony of proper breeding, darling, and refinement, darling! Now my cucumber sandwiches, on the other hoof...\nPinkie Pie: Bet you I can fit them all in my mouth! Ahh...\nRarity: Pinkie, darling, please!\nPinkie Pie: [chomping]\nApplejack: [yelps]\n[thud]\n[splash]\n[bubbling]\nApplejack: U-uh, Rarity, I\u2014\nRarity: Well, I never! Hum-ph!\nPinkie Pie: Me neither! Hum-ph!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Do you want to say it, or should I?\nSpike: I'll go. That sure doesn't sound like Rarity or Pinkie Pie!\nApplejack: Oh, it gets a sight worse than that!\n\nPinkie Pie: It's P.W.T. \u2013 Pi\u00f1ata Whacking Time!\nRarity: Oh, darling, whacking is a base pastime for common ponies. Doesn't interest me in the least.\nPinkie Pie: Meh. Hee-hee!\nApplejack: Huh?\n[spinning]\nApplejack: Whoooooa!\n[lightning cracks]\nApplejack: Looks like we need to change course!\nRarity: Ooh! Why, this will make a perfect tablecloth for my cheeseboard!\nApplejack: Maybe so, but it's also the only way to find Plunder Cove!\nPinkie Pie: [giggling]\nApplejack: [narrating] And Pinkie Pie was just about as helpful as a weasel in a hen house.\nPinkie Pie: Captain Pinkie Pie reporting for map duty!\nRarity: [yelps]\n[splash]\nApplejack: Hold on, everypony!\n[splash]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait, so it was Rarity and Pinkie's fault?\nApplejack: Yup! And maybe if they ever apologized, I'll consider talkin' to them again.\nSpike: If they all blame each other, I don't know how we're gonna get them to talk again.\nTwilight Sparkle: Neither do I, Spike. Neither do I.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: There's gotta be some way to fix this. If Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity keep not talking to each other, they could forget what good friends they really are!\nSpike: I just don't get it! All of their stories are so different! [sigh] We're never gonna figure out what really happened.\nTwilight Sparkle: Their stories were different, but they also had a lot in common.\nSpike: I guess... They were all on a ship that sank, and... that's about it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Not quite.\n[chalk drawing]\nTwilight Sparkle: A-ha! Not only do I think I know how the boat sank, I have a pretty good idea how to get Rarity, Applejack and Pinkie Pie back together!\n\nSpike: I hope this plan of yours works.\nApplejack: [panting] Winona brought me your note about a friendship emergency! H-How can I help?\nRarity: [panting] Opalescence delivered your message, Twilight! What's the emergency?\nPinkie Pie: It's a good thing it was time for Gummy's bath, or I might not have seen your note about the emergency, Twilight!\n[beat]\nApplejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity: What's she doing here?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry, but I just didn't know how else to get the three of you here together, and there really is a friendship emergency! Yours!\nApplejack: Oh, there's no emergency! I'm just waitin' for an apology.\nRarity: An apology?!\nPinkie Pie: What?! Why would you want me to apologize when it was Rarity's fault?!\nRarity: What are you talking about? Applejack clearly caused the boat to sink! She stranded us in the middle of the ocean!\nSpike: [frustrated scream] Will somepony please tell me how you made it back?!\n[beat]\n\n[splashing]\nApplejack: [gasps]\nRarity: [gasps]\n\nRarity: Well... Maybe it wasn't the middle of the ocean...\nSpike: Ugh.\nApplejack: Even so, I don't appreciate bein' hornswoggled into comin' back here.\nRarity: On that, at least, we agree.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah!\nTwilight Sparkle: I know you each have a different perspective on how the boat capsized and blame each other, but if you come on the boat with me I'll show you what really happened.\nRarity: Well, not that I have any doubts, but it will feel good for everypony to see exactly whose fault it was.\nApplejack: I think we all know which pony's about to be proven right.\nPinkie Pie: We sure do.\nSpike: Like I said, I sure hope this works.\n\nSpike: [nervous laugh] [hushed] Whatever you're looking for, I hope you find it soon!\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't worry, Spike. I've got it all under control. [to the others] While all of your stories seem very different, they all had something in common \u2013 cucumber sandwiches.\n[clunk]\nApplejack: What in the hay does that have to do with anythin'?\n[splash]\nRarity: And why would you waste a perfectly good hors d'oeuvre?\nTwilight Sparkle: You also mentioned the bubbling water.\n[bubbling]\nTwilight Sparkle: And the swell. Cucumber just happens to be the favorite food of the tri-horned bunyip, and bubbles followed by a swell is what happens when they swim up to the shallows from deep water.\nApplejack: So... we attracted a tri-horned whatchamacallit?\nRarity: With cucumber sandwiches?\nPinkie Pie: Sounds like a stretch.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hello, bunyip, sir!\n[bunyip noises]\nRarity: So that's a...\nTwilight Sparkle: A tri-horned bunyip! Who's very sorry he accidentally knocked over your boat. Right?\n[bunyip noises]\nPinkie Pie: Wait, the storm had nothing to do with the capsizing?\nTwilight Sparkle: Nope!\nRarity: All right. Even if our friend the bunyip is responsible for sinking the boat, it still doesn't excuse a certain pony's behavior!\nApplejack: Me?! How about you and Pinkie Pie?\nPinkie Pie: Pfft\u2013 What? Who? Me? No\u2013\nTwilight Sparkle: I think I can explain that too. Each of you spent so much time trying to come up with the perfect way to get the others out of their element, that you didn't notice your friends were doing the same thing!\nApplejack: Wait a minute. You brought all those games and things for us?\nPinkie Pie: Of course! I figured the boat trip was the perfect time to do things that were silly and fun!\nRarity: And I was just trying to give the two of you the elegant cruise I thought you deserved.\nApplejack: And I just wanted to give you two a high seas adventure, since that'd be somethin' new and different for y'all.\nApplejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity: Ohhhh.\nRarity: That is so sweet. You must have gone through so much trouble.\nApplejack: Well, not half as much trouble as you did makin' all that fancy food, and bringin' all those games!\nTwilight Sparkle: I guess this just teaches us that even long time friends need to work at communication.\nPinkie Pie: Well, there's something I'd like to communicate to you all right now! You girls are the best friends a pony could ever have!\nRarity: Oh, let's never fight again!\nPinkie Pie: You got it!\nApplejack: [simultaneously] Agreed!\n[bunyip noises]\nApplejack: All right, you big softie! Bring it in!\n[bunyip noises]\n\nPinkie Pie: Come on, bunyip, sir! You got it!\n[splash]\n[coins clinking]\nTwilight Sparkle: One thing's for sure, Spike. There's nothing like a luxurious adventure boat party to get you out of your element.\nSpike: You said it!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nApplejack: Well, that's the last of it, Filthy Rich.\nFilthy Rich: Just Rich, please. And on behalf of Rich's Barnyard Bargains, thanks for another season's shipment of zap apple jam.\nApplejack: Our pleasure. See ya next time.\n[cart pulls away]\nApplejack: Uh, Apple Bloom, did you pack up the cider into the same crates as the zap apple jam?\nApple Bloom: Sure did! Now that I'm gettin' older, I wanna prove I can handle more responsibility on the farm.\nApplejack: But the crates aren't marked. You kept track of what went into which crate, right?\nApple Bloom: Oh. Um... y-yep. I totally kept track of everything.\nApplejack: Good. Because we wouldn't want Filthy Rich to get a shipment of cider when he's supposed to get zap apple jam. You know how Granny feels about sellin' cider anywhere but on the farm. Are you sure he got the right crates?\nApple Bloom: [huffs] Sure I'm sure! Now why don't you and Big Mac head on out to the house and let me finish up here?\n[glass jars rattle]\nApplejack: If you gave Rich the zap apple jam, then what's this here?\nApple Bloom: Um... extra?\nBig McIntosh: Nnnope.\n\n[theme song]\n\nFilthy Rich: Granny knows I-I wasn't tryin' to make off with a shipment of cider, right? Because I would never do that.\nApplejack: Don't worry. We know exactly whose fault it was.\n[cart pulls away]\n[crate dragging]\nApplejack: Now why in tarnation would you lie to me, Apple Bloom?\nApple Bloom: I was kinda hopin' I could fix it before anypony found out.\nApplejack: Tellin' lies won't fix anythin'. Trust me. I know.\nApple Bloom: What could you possibly know about it? You've never told a lie in your whole life!\nBig McIntosh: [laughing]\nGranny Smith: [laughing]\nApple Bloom: What's so funny?\nGranny Smith: Oh-ho, sugarcube. [laughing] Your big sister lied so much when she was a filly, the whole family ended up in the hospital.\nApple Bloom: What?!\nBig McIntosh: [laughing] Eeyup!\nApplejack: [groans] You might as well tell her the whole story. Might even do her some good.\nGranny Smith: When Applejack and Big Mac were just a wee bit older than you are now, they both kept a-squabblin' over who would run the farm better.\n\nYoung Applejack: All I'm sayin' is that you may have plenty of brawn, but I'm the one with the ideas on how to run things better around here!\nYoung Big McIntosh: [laughs] Applejack, Applejack, Applejack, ideas are all well and good, but you can't plow a field with 'em. I don't know how many times I've told you that.\nYoung Applejack: Too many!\nGranny Smith: You two horned toads better stop jabberin' and get to workin'! Yeah, they'd better. I need you to go to town. The apple blight's been awful, and if we don't get more spray, cider season'll be shorter than a dwarf crabapple tree!\nYoung Applejack and Young Big McIntosh: [snarl]\n\nYoung Big McIntosh: It's like I was just tellin' Cousin Braeburn last week. Now there's a pony who knows how to put his back into a problem...\nYoung Applejack: [growls] Oh, hey there, Filthy Rich!\nFilthy Rich: Just Rich, please. And I'd you to meet my fianc\u00e9e, Spoiled Milk. Honey, this is Applejack and Big Mac, the two hardest workin' ponies at Sweet Apple Acres.\nSpoiled Milk: You work on a farm? How... quaint.\nFilthy Rich: [chuckles] Oh, now, dear, be nice. Sweet Apple Acres makes zap apple jam. It's one of Dad's best-sellers.\nSpoiled Milk: You mean one of your best-sellers. [to AJ and Big Mac] My amazing husband-to-be is running the Rich family business now. Did you know that? Well, now you do.\nFilthy Rich: [chuckles] Don't mind Spoiled Milk. She's just proud of me. Uh, but she's right. I'm in charge of the store now, and I'm just burstin' with ideas I wanna try!\nYoung Applejack: Like what?\nFilthy Rich: Well, how 'bout this? Cider season's around the corner. Why not let me sell it for ya?\nYoung Applejack: That is an interesting idea.\nYoung Big McIntosh: Well, maybe it's interestin', an' maybe it ain't. But it's definitely not a new idea. Granny Smith told us your grandpa, Stinkin' Rich, used to ask her every year if he could sell our cider in your store, and Granny told him every year about the tradition of everypony in Ponyville linin' up out at Sweet Apple Acres.\nFilthy Rich: So start a new tradition. Some day, one o' y'all will take over the farm just like I've taken over the store. I'm guessin' it'll the one with the best ideas.\nYoung Big McIntosh: Well, now, as I've said many a time before, ideas are all well an' good, but you can't plow a field\u2014\nYoung Applejack: Ya know what? How 'bout we give you three barrels of cider early, and if it sells well, we'll make a deal for the rest?\nFilthy Rich: Oh, hey, now! Perfect! [to Spoiled Milk] Come on, honey. I've gotta get everything ready.\nYoung Applejack: Hoo-wee! I tell ya, if the future means me runnin' Sweet Apple Acres and you bein' quiet, I can't wait!\n\nYoung Big McIntosh: I just can't believe you'd make a deal with Filthy Rich without even talkin' to Granny!\nYoung Applejack: Aw, Granny will love the idea. And then she'll decide that I'm the one who should take over the farm. You'll see.\nGranny Smith: See what?\nYoung Big McIntosh: Applejack here had another one of her \"big ideas\", and I think we all know my position on ideas. You can't\u2014\nGranny Smith and Young Applejack: \"Can't plow a field with 'em.\"\nYoung Big McIntosh: Ee... right.\nGranny Smith: Big idea, hmmm?\nYoung Applejack: Actually, more of an opportunity. Y'see, we ran into Filthy Rich in town. Did ya know he's runnin' the family store now?\nGranny Smith: And what does this here \"opportunity\" mean for Sweet Apple Acres?\nYoung Applejack: Well, uh, since cider season is almost here, he\u2014or, I-I mean, I\u2014thought it'd be a good idea to give him a few barrels of cider to sell at the store before the season starts.\nGranny Smith: Oh, is that all? Absolutely not!\nYoung Applejack: [groans]\n\nYoung Applejack: [scoffs] But, Granny, why can't we sell a few barrels o' cider early to Filthy Rich? And how is it any different than when you gave zap apple jam to Filthy's grandpappy to sell?\nGranny Smith: Your cider and your jam ain't the same thing! Zap apple jam jars preserve the flavor for moons, but cider starts to spoil the second it comes out the press. That is why every cider season, all of Ponyville lines up at Sweet Apple Acres. And first come is first served! Hmph!\nYoung Applejack: I get what you're sayin', Granny. But couldn't you make an exception just this once? I sort of promised.\nGranny Smith: Mm, meh-enh. Besides, cider-makin' is iffy business. And we're probably not gonna have a lot this year anyway, what with all the blight. I am sorry, Applejack, but you's just gonna have to un-promise.\nYoung Applejack: [sighs] Oh.\n\nYoung Big McIntosh: I hate to say I told you so, Applejack, but\u2014\nYoung Applejack: You an' I both know you don't hate to say anythin'.\nYoung Big McIntosh: Well, I've always thought that the most important thing a pony can do is say exactly what's on his mind to anypony who'll listen, so everypony everywhere always knows everythin' they're thinkin', and\u2014\nYoung Applejack: And you don't ever have to listen to anypony else.\nYoung Big McIntosh: What?\nYoung Applejack: Exactly.\n\nFilthy Rich: Well, if it ain't my new business partner!\nYoung Applejack: Uh, about the cider, Rich...\nFilthy Rich: Take a look at what I did last night after we made our deal!\n[zip!]\nFilthy Rich: Whoo! Ha! Pretty great, huh?\nYoung Applejack: The thing is, I-I don't think I can get you any.\nFilthy Rich: What? Well, I did all this work on your say-so! We shook hooves and everything!\nYoung Big McIntosh: Well, you see, at Sweet Apple Acres, we've always been about quality, and while your basic jam jar'll keep\u2014\nYoung Applejack: Plus it's been a tough harvest this year, what with all the blight.\nFilthy Rich: Gah! Sounds to me like you're tryin' to make excuses! Whenever Granddad dealt with Granny Smith, she kept her word! If you can't do that, then maybe our families should stop doin' business together! Altogether!\nYoung Big McIntosh: Now, now, the thing is, Rich, it ain't really up to us. Y'see, Granny's\u2014\nYoung Applejack: Uh, sick!\nFilthy Rich: Wait, Granny's sick? I-I had no idea.\nYoung Big McIntosh: Ee... yeah. Nopony did.\nYoung Applejack: Uh, what Big Mac means is, uh, we've been tryin' to keep it quiet. Don't want people to make rash decisions about doin' business with Sweet Apple Acres just because we're, uh, a little short-hooved at the moment.\nFilthy Rich: Oh, my! O-Of course, of course! I am so sorry. Please let me know if there's anything I can do.\nYoung Applejack: Much appreciated. But right now, we-we only ask for your understandin' during this difficult time.\nFilthy Rich: Mm-hmm.\n\nYoung Big McIntosh: You were supposed to tell Rich the simple truth! But instead, you made things worse with a giant lie!\nYoung Applejack: W-W-What was I supposed to do? You heard Rich. If I told him the truth, he was gonna stop doin' business with us altogether.\nYoung Big McIntosh: Yeah, but that's only because I... I forgot to ask if we had any oat crumbles for this delicious-lookin' salad, Granny.\nGranny Smith: [grunts] Yeah, I'll go take a look. [mutters]\nYoung Big McIntosh: [hushed] That was only because you made promises you couldn't keep! But there's gotta be a better way out of this mess than by makin' up some story about Granny bein' sick!\nYoung Applejack: [hushed] Well, it worked, didn't it?\n[knock on door]\nFilthy Rich: Sorry to drop by unannounced. We just wanted to come by to wish Granny a speedy recovery.\nYoung Big McIntosh: [sarcastic] Look, sis. Our good friend, Mr. Rich and his fianc\u00e9e... are here. Oh, and they brought flowers! For Granny! On account o' she's sick! Like you said. Ain't that sweet?\n[door rattles]\nYoung Applejack: Uh, excuse me one second!\n[door closes]\nGranny Smith: Aah!\n[crash!]\nGranny Smith: Golly, what in tarnation?\nYoung Applejack: Oh, I'm sorry, Granny. I-I didn't see ya there.\nGranny Smith: Ya came blastin' in so fast, t'weren't possible to see nothin'!\nYoung Applejack: Can you go out to the barn? I, uh, I think I might've left a blight sprayer in the orchard.\nGranny Smith: Are you outta yer apple-pickin' mind?! It's suppertime, girl!\nYoung Applejack: I know, but, uh, if we forgot a sprayer, I'd wanna get it before dark. You go start countin', a\u2014and I'll tell Big Mac we'll be right back, okay?\n[door slams]\nYoung Big McIntosh: ...so from that moment on, I took to referrin' to myself as Big or Large or...\nFilthy Rich: Oh, Applejack! Your brother was just explainin' why he always wears his yoke.\nSpoiled Milk: Even though we asked him how your grandmare is doing!\nYoung Applejack: Oh, well, you know how Big Mac can get to... to talkin', especially when he's upset. And right now, he's just as worried about Granny Smith as I am.\n\nFilthy Rich: Oh, dear. Is she doin' that bad?\nYoung Applejack: Well, one thing's for sure, she... she shouldn't be seein' anypony right now. In fact, I'm gettin' more upset just thinkin' about it. Excuse me.\n[thud]\nGranny Smith: D'oh! What in the frilly fumidil has gotten into you?!\nYoung Applejack: Sorry, Granny. I just decided if I helped you, it would go faster.\nGranny Smith: Well, you're too late. All the sprayers are here.\nYoung Applejack: Oh, good. Uh, say, Granny, when did you first fight the apple blight again?\nGranny Smith: It was my second year here in Ponyville. Uh, they was before I had the rick on the one knee.\n\nYoung Big McIntosh: ...and others say that's how the trees got to growin' so tall. But to me, it's just how I got my cutie mark!\nSpoiled Milk: But we asked when we could come back to see Granny.\nYoung Applejack: Uh, Big Mac didn't wanna be rude, but you just can't see Granny right now, because she's... got apple blight!\nFilthy Rich: [gasps] I thought only trees got the blight!\nYoung Applejack: Yeah, that's usually the case. [beat] The doctors think it's from workin' in the orchards for so many years. [beat] Y'see, we had to take Granny to Ponyville General. We just got back right before you showed up.\nFilthy Rich: Oh, my. That is terrible!\nSpoiled Milk: Ew! It's not contagious, is it?\nYoung Applejack: Um, I'm sure you'll be fine, but you should leave... [coughs] ...just in case.\nFilthy Rich: You're right. We're gonna have to hurry if we wanna get there before visitin' hours are over.\nYoung Applejack: That's right. Wait. Get where?\nFilthy Rich: Why, the hospital, of course. I'm sure we'll see you there.\n\nYoung Big McIntosh: Tellin' Filthy Rich that Granny's in the hospital just made everythin' a hundred times worse! What are we supposed to do now?\nYoung Applejack: I got it!\n\nGranny Smith: Dropped my second best teeth right in the pigpen, and that was the worst case of apple blight I have ever seen!\nYoung Applejack: I'd love to hear more, Granny, but we gotta get to the hospital right away!\nGranny Smith: The hospital? Why? Who's sick?\nYoung Big McIntosh: You are, apparently.\nYoung Applejack: What he means is you're needed at the hospital.\nGranny Smith: Heh. Whatever for?\nYoung Applejack: It's the apple blight! It's startin' to infect ponies now! The doctors need an expert opinion, and nopony knows more about fightin' blight than Granny Smith!\nGranny Smith: Well, what in tarnation are we waitin' for? Let's go!\nYoung Big McIntosh: [inhales] [chokes]\n\nYoung Applejack: [gasps] You know, we're supposed to go in, uh, in the back! Uh, to avoid anypony in the waitin' room with the blight.\n\n[indistinct conversations]\nYoung Applejack: Oops! I almost forgot!\n[hooves squeaking on tiles]\nYoung Big McIntosh: Hrk!\nYoung Applejack: This is perfect! Now you don't have to worry about catchin' the blight.\nGranny Smith: [slightly muffled] If you say so, dearie.\nYoung Applejack: Now you wait right here while I, uh... check on your presentation!\nGranny Smith: What in the rotten rhubarb is goin' on here?\n\nYoung Applejack: [nervous laugh] Fancy meetin' you two here!\nSpoiled Milk: Well, we told you we were coming.\nFilthy Rich: Well, I'm glad we found you, because I can't seem to find Granny's room or any nurses who've even heard about a pony with apple blight.\nYoung Applejack: Granny's room. Sure! Just go down here, take a left, then a right, go down some stairs, up a bunch more stairs, uh, through the cafeteria, left three more times, and then you're there! Easy as Granny's apple pie! [nervous laugh]\nFilthy Rich: Uh, aren't you comin' with us?\nYoung Applejack: Uh, I'll catch up! I gotta find Big Mac!\n\nYoung Applejack: Okay, Granny, just wait here one second and we can go.\nGranny Smith: Where are you two going?\nYoung Applejack: Big Mac can't come! He, uh, might be contagious!\nYoung Big McIntosh and Granny Smith: Contagious?!\nYoung Applejack: All right, climb up here and I'll cover you up. Then I'll bring Rich in, tell him you're Granny, but you're not allowed to take the sheets off. You moan a few times, he leaves, and this whole thing is over.\nYoung Big McIntosh: This is spinnin' way out of control, Applejack! Now I know you thought sellin' cider in Filthy's store was a good idea, but it ain't worth lyin' to him about Granny bein' sick and needin' to go to the hospital, or fibbin' to Granny about them wantin' her come here to talk about the blight, or\u2014\nYoung Applejack: Big McIntosh, please just listen to me for once! This ain't about my ideas. If Rich finds out about all the lies, he'll cut off ties with us and the farm'll go under! Now do you want that to happen, or do you wanna help?\nYoung Big McIntosh: Why can't you be Granny? You're her size, and this is all your fault in the first place.\nYoung Applejack: I would, but if I let you do the talkin', you'd just ramble on and on until we all got caught!\nYoung Big McIntosh: [groans]\nYoung Applejack: Just lay down, keep still, and promise me you won't say anythin' for once in your life!\nYoung Big McIntosh: [unconvinced] Eeeeyup.\nYoung Applejack: Granny! [squeaks] [hushed] Granny!\nGranny Smith: It's about time! What is goin' on around here?!\nYoung Applejack: Uh, Granny, they need you to wait here! I'll come get ya!\n[door opens]\nGranny Smith: [yelps]\n[door closes]\nFilthy Rich: [panting] There you are! We've been going in circles looking for Granny's room!\nYoung Applejack: Well, you're in luck, 'cause it's-it's right over here, and this time I'll make sure you don't get lost.\n[gurney squeaking]\nYoung Applejack: What in the dadgum\u2014?!\nSpoiled Milk: What now?\nYoung Applejack: He\u2013 I mean, she was right here! Oh, no. We gotta go!\n[gurney squeaking]\nSpoiled Milk: I-Is that Granny Smith?\nFilthy Rich: Where are they takin' her?\n[door opens]\n[gurney squeaking]\nYoung Applejack: You two, don't lose that gurney! [hushed] Granny, what are you doin'? You were supposed to stay there!\nGranny Smith: It was a supply closet!\nYoung Applejack: Oh. Uh... Well, okay, come with me, but be quiet! You know, save your voice for the big presentation!\n\n[door opens]\nYoung Applejack: [gasps]\n\"Hippocratic Oath\": I-I-I'm sorry, but you can't get any closer without a gown and mask.\nYoung Applejack: But-but-but-but that's my brother on there!\n\"Hippocratic Oath\": Don't worry. This is our best doctor. She'll have your brother back on his hooves in no time.\nYoung Applejack: [groans]\nGranny Smith: Now apple blight is a serious disease!\n\"Doctor Spring Bud\": [splutters] Did she say... apple blight?\n\"Open Heart\": I think she said \"gasket mites\".\nGranny Smith: And once your trunk turns red like this, the only thing to do is prune the branches.\nFilthy Rich: [gasps] Oh, no! Granny!\n\"Open Heart\": Did you say...\"prune them branches\"?\nGranny Smith: Well, sure! What else you gonna do once the blight gets this bad?\n[cloth moving]\n[scare chord]\n[doctors, nurses, and audience gasping]\nYoung Applejack: Everypony, just stop! This is all a big misunderstandin'! [pants] Actually... it's a big lie.\n[cloth moving]\n[doctors, nurses, and audience gasping]\nGranny Smith: Big Mac?!\nFilthy Rich: [gasps] Granny Smith?! What is goin' on here, Applejack?!\nGranny Smith: That is a darn good question.\nYoung Applejack: [sighs] I'm not sure if I was worried that nopony was listenin' to my ideas or just nervous that I wouldn't be the one to end up runnin' the farm, but... I promised somethin' to Filthy Rich that I couldn't deliver, and I was too embarrassed to admit it.\nFilthy Rich: So Granny was never sick?\nGranny Smith: And there ain't no apple blighted ponies?\nYoung Big McIntosh: Nnnope.\nYoung Applejack: Those were all lies. A-And I thought if you found out, you'd stop doin' business with the farm. So I just kept tellin' more.\n\"Hippocratic Oath\": So she's not a doctor?\nYoung Applejack: Please don't make Granny and the farm suffer for what I did! This whole thing is my fault.\nYoung Big McIntosh: That's... not entirely true. Maybe if I paid more attention to what you had to say instead of talkin' all the time, none o' this would've happened in the first place. I just need to... talk less and listen more. Especially to you.\nYoung Applejack: [sighs] Thanks, big brother. And whether it's me runnin' Sweet Apple Acres or you, I know it'll be in good hooves.\nGranny Smith: Well, that's nice, but I don't know what in blazes you two are talkin' about! I ain't goin' anywhere anytime soon! [blows raspberry] Runnin' the farm. Not after this display! Not likely! [to Filthy Rich] And don't you go gettin' any ideas about cuttin' ties with Sweet Apple Acres, or I'm goin' right to your grandpappy. Get me?\nFilthy Rich: [stutters] Um, yes, ma'am.\nGranny Smith: Now, who here still wants to hear about the apple blight? Now, when I was a filly...\n\nApple Bloom: I can't believe you told all those lies!\nApplejack: It's not a story I'm proud of, but it taught me a lifelong lesson about bein' honest. I hope you learned somethin', too.\nApple Bloom: I sure did. I learned that nopony starts out perfect and sometimes you gotta make a few mistakes to figure out who you are.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nApple Bloom: But I think the most important thing I learned is who really runs Sweet Apple Acres.\nApplejack, Apple Bloom, and Big McIntosh: Granny!\nGranny Smith: You're darn tootin'! Now everypony quit your lollygaggery and get back to work! Right after we have a glass of cider.\nApple family: [laughing]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[locker door opens]\nRainbow Dash: Spring training was awesome, but I can't wait to see my friends!\n[locker door closes]\nRainbow Dash: I'm gonna catch up on some Daring Do with Twilight, help Applejack make my favorite cider, and have a sleepover with Pinkie!\nMisty Fly: We get it. You have a fun week planned.\nSpitfire: Meanwhile, I'm stuck here running trials week at the Academy.\nRainbow Dash: But you love yelling and blowing your whistle.\nSpitfire: Yeah. I do.\nRainbow Dash: See you gals later!\n[whoosh]\nRainbow Dash: [chuckles]\n[whoosh]\n\nRainbow Dash: [sighs]\n[cutie mark ringing]\nRainbow Dash: Huh? Oh, the map!\n\nRainbow Dash: Hey, Twilight! So where am I going? The Crystal Mountains? Vanhoover? Here? Please say here.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, the good news is we both got called by the map!\nRainbow Dash: Awesome! [beat] Does that mean there's bad news?\nTwilight Sparkle: No. Well, not exactly.\nRainbow Dash: [groans] I was just there!\n\n[theme song]\n\n[whoosh]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ooh!\nRainbow Dash: Ahem.\nSpitfire: All right, newbies! Welcome to trials week for the Wonderbolt Academy! You'll be judged on your speed, strength, agility, and technique, culminating in a final evaluation. Will it be hard? Yes! Will you cry? Maybe. Will you fly so much your wings fall off? That has only happened once.\nAngel Wings: She's just exaggerating to make a point, right? I mean, wings can't really fall off... can they?\nSpitfire: You think you've got what it takes to be an elite flyer?\nSky Stinger: Yes, ma'am.\nRest of recruits: Yes, ma'am!\nSpitfire: Well, lemme tell you. You don't!\nRainbow Dash: [sighs wistfully] I remember when she said that to me.\nRecruits: [muttering in awe]\nAngel Wings: You don't think Rainbow Dash is the pony whose wings fell off, do you?\nSpitfire: [blows whistle] Quit your whispering and give me five hundred laps! Go, go, go!\n[whooshes]\nAngel Wings: Um, I just wanted you to know, you two are my favorite ponies in all of Equestria.\nSpitfire: Well, isn't that sweet? Now get going on those laps!\n[whoosh]\nSpitfire: Welcome, Princess Twilight. [to Rainbow Dash] What are you doing back so soon?\nRainbow Dash: Official friendship business.\nTwilight Sparkle: Have you noticed anypony having a hard time with their friends?\nSpitfire: Not really, but it's not my job to worry about their relationships. I'm here to make them elite flyers.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Adorable. They're so full of hope and competition. Eh, their technique could use some work, though.\nTwilight Sparkle: You should tell them. I'm sure they'd appreciate any notes from you.\nRainbow Dash: Nah. I wouldn't want to mess with their confidence.\nTwilight Sparkle: But they'll never get better if they don't know what to work on.\nSpitfire: Sloppy wing placement, crooked lines... I'm gonna have to drill them on basic technique in the classroom portion.\nTwilight Sparkle: Classroom portion?\nSpitfire: Yeah, it's everypony's least favorite part of trial week, but it has to be done.\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe we can help!\nRainbow Dash: We can?\nTwilight Sparkle: Absolutely! Between your flying skills and my teaching expertise, they could learn a lot! Plus, once they get to know us, they'll be more comfortable coming to us with their friendship problems!\nRainbow Dash: Count us in!\nSpitfire: Great! [blows whistle]\n[whooshes, thud]\nSpitfire: You have your work cut out for you.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank goodness I had time to whip up a few charts on flight patterns and wing symmetry! It's fresh in my mind from when I learned to fly! This is so exciting!\nRainbow Dash: Maybe for you. I practically fell asleep when I went through this. Tell you what. I'll leave the teaching stuff to you, and I'll just make sure they stay awake!

Class is in session!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hello, students! I'm Twilight Sparkle, and this is Rainbow Dash.\nRainbow Dash: But you can call us \"T-Sparks\" and \"The Dashinator\"!\nTwilight Sparkle: [clears throat]\nRainbow Dash: [laughs nervously] Just kidding.\nTwilight Sparkle: And we're here to go over basic flying technique.\nSky Stinger: [groans]\nRainbow Dash: Who said that?!\nSky Stinger: Me. I mean, we're here because we're amazingly awesome crazy-good flyers. We're way past basics.\nRainbow Dash: What's your name?\nSky Stinger: Sky Stinger. You've, uh, never heard of me?\nVapor Trail: He set the record for the fastest vertical acceleration rate! Five hundred feet in two seconds!\nRainbow Dash: [unimpressed] Huh. That's pretty impressive.\nVapor Trail: It's amazing.\nTwilight Sparkle: [clears throat] It is, and we can talk personal records after class, Ms...?\nSky Stinger: Vapor Trail. She's my wingpony. I never fly without her.\nRainbow Dash: But you'll have to in the solo trials.\nVapor Trail: There are... [gulps] ...solo trials?\nRainbow Dash: Yup. It's a part of your final evaluation.\nSky Stinger: [scoffs] We'll ace that test with our wings tied behind our flanks. My picture will go right up there, next to yours.\nRainbow Dash: That's a mighty big claim, considering everypony here is an amazingly awesome crazy-good flyer.\nSky Stinger: I know.\nTwilight Sparkle: [clears throat] Okay! Let's get back on track. Now, who can tell me the best wing angle to achieve minimal air resistance?\nRainbow Dash: [snoring]\nTwilight Sparkle: [blows airhorn]\nRainbow Dash: [quickly] Wake up newbies! Class is in session!\n\n[door opens]\nRecruits: [chattering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, there were a few hiccups, but overall, that went pretty well.\nRainbow Dash: [cricks neck, yawns] Yeah, nopony fell asleep. What? I'm not a student!\nSky Stinger: Hey, Teach!\nRainbow Dash: Me or Twilight? Probably Twilight.\nSky Stinger: Um, uh, both. About the solo test. I'm actually kinda worried about it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Aw, that's all right. We all have moments where we doubt ourselves.\nSky Stinger: No, no. I've absolutely zero doubts about myself. I'm a strong flyer. Like, really, really, really strong. This isn't about me. I'm worried for Vapor.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, well, that is very... kind of you?\nRainbow Dash: Tell you what. It's almost time for your freestyle training. Why don't you grab her and show us what you got?\nSky Stinger: Yes! Prepare to be impressed!\n[whoosh]\nSky Stinger: By me.\n[whoosh]\nSky Stinger: Like I said, Vapor still needs work.\n[whoosh]\n\n[whooshing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, he may be full of himself, but I have to admit, Sky is an excellent flyer. He must have shot up two hundred feet!\nRainbow Dash: But did you see Vapor Trail? Her wing was under his. I think she gave him a boost.\nTwilight Sparkle: I guess I didn't even notice Vapor. I was too busy watching Sky.\n[whooshing]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] I think you're right! Vapor just created a gust of wind that caught Sky's wing at a forty-five degree angle, propelling him into a flipping loop! [beat] Somepony paid attention in class!\nRainbow Dash: Sky obviously has no idea he's not actually amazingly awesome.\nTwilight Sparkle: And Vapor's so busy making her friend look good, she's not focused on her own flying at all. [gasps] This must be our friendship problem! And there's only one thing to do!\n\n\n\n\nRainbow Dash:\nFix it without telling them.\n\n\nTwilight Sparkle:\nTell them the truth.\n\n\nRainbow Dash:\nFix it without telling them.\n\nTwilight Sparkle:\nTell them the truth.\n\n[distant whooshing]\nTwilight Sparkle: You don't want to tell them?\nRainbow Dash: Of course not! Flying is like thirty percent skill and seventy percent confidence! You can't mess with a flyer's confidence!\nTwilight Sparkle: But you can't improve if you don't think you have to! Besides, Vapor's keeping a pretty big secret from Sky, and that could lead to trouble!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, but if we tell them that they've been holding each other back, that could be trouble too!\nSky Stinger: Ah, I nailed that flipping loop. I'm actually surprised you're still here. Thought I blew you away.\nVapor Trail: [out of breath] You were... great, Sky.\n[thud]\nSpitfire: Come on, Vapor Trail! You're gonna have to build up your endurance if you want a shot at the Academy! Wonderbolts don't get winded! Angel Wings, you call that cloud-busting?! That cloud barely knew you were there! I love my job.\nSky Stinger: We'll keep working, and who knows? One day, you might come close to being almost as good as me.\nVapor Trail: Oh, I don't think so. You were voted Stratusburg's most promising flyer! I was voted best sneeze. [sneezes]\nSky Stinger: You do have a really great sneeze.\nVapor Trail: Thanks, Sky, but I don't think I can sneeze my way into the Academy. [sighs] I'm pretty beat. I'm gonna hit the showers.\nSky Stinger: You have to help her.\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, she's not the one\u2014\nRainbow Dash: Will do!\n\n[locker opens]\nRainbow Dash: Hey, you did great. You're a really strong flyer.\nVapor Trail: Uh, me?\nTwilight Sparkle: Vapor Trail, we know what you've been doing.\nRainbow Dash: You've been doing great!\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans] You've been helping Sky!\nVapor Trail: Uh, I don't know what you're talking about! Sky doesn't need anypony's help. He's amazing.\n[poink poink]\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Not without you. And it's gonna be pretty obvious during the solo trials when he can't get enough air to do a flipping loop.\nVapor Trail: Oh, no! I can't let that happen! I mean, ah, uh... Aw, sugarcubes!\nTwilight Sparkle: Why are you doing this for him?\nVapor Trail: [sighs] It started when we were kids. You have to understand...\n\nVapor Trail: [narrating] ...Sky grew up with a lot of siblings. It was tough. He was always trying to get his parents' attention. Meanwhile, I was an only child who hated all the attention I got from mine.\n\"Twirly Whirly\": Vapor Trail! Where are you? Do you need a snack? Do you wanna do homework?\n\"Steer Straight\": Or we can just spend some time together! All day is never enough!\nYoung Vapor Trail: [sighs]\nYoung Sky Stinger: Mom, Dad, I'm here! Look, look, look-look-look-look, hey! Mom, Dad, can you see?\n[wind blowing]\n[whooshing, baby crying]\nYoung Sky Stinger: [sighs]\nYoung Vapor Trail: Whoa, that was amazing!\n[whoosh]\n\nVapor Trail: [narrating] Flying together gave us both what we wanted! But I never told Sky how much I was helping him. It started with a small boost here or a little gust of wind there, but I didn't think my help could actually hurt his chances.\nTwilight Sparkle: I understand. But now you're both in trouble!\nRainbow Dash: You need to work on your tricks, and Sky needs to be able to fly without you or he won't make it.\nVapor Trail: Oh, but he has to! Flying with the Wonderbolts has been Sky's dream ever since he was a colt!\nTwilight Sparkle: What about you?\nVapor Trail: I... I guess I haven't thought about it. I just want to be with my best friend.\nRainbow Dash: Then we have to find a way to help both of you.\nTwilight Sparkle: Starting with telling Sky the truth.\nVapor Trail: No, you can't! Sky will be crushed! And without his confidence, he won't fly as well!\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Then I guess we'll give Dash's method a shot.\nRainbow Dash: Yes! Hah-hah! I love being right! Okay, here's what we do. Sky needs to build his strength. Air drills, wing lifts, all that boring methodical stuff.\nTwilight Sparkle: Sounds like my cup of oats.\nVapor Trail: But how will we get him to do that? He doesn't think he needs practice.\nRainbow Dash: We'll just tell Sky that he should practice with Twilight so you won't feel so self-conscious about getting special training from me.\nVapor Trail: With you? Really?! You'd do that for me?\nRainbow Dash: Hah. You say that like it's not gonna be a blast.\n\n[montage music]\n[thud]\n\nVapor Trail: Whooa... Ah!\n\n[clang, clang, clang, clang]\n\n[whooshing]\n\n[wind blowing]\n\n[tires screeching]\nRainbow Dash: Oh, you were awesome!\nVapor Trail: Really? Thanks! I can't believe I was able to keep up!\nRainbow Dash: That's the first nice thing I've heard you say about yourself.\nSky Stinger: Hey, can we switch now? I want to do tricks with Rainbow Dash!\nVapor Trail: You can't! I mean, uh, you're already so good at the fancy stuff!\nSky Stinger: Heh. And the basic stuff. [beat] You're right, I don't need to practice at all.\nVapor Trail: Um, maybe, Sky, you should...\nSky Stinger: I'm already the best and everypony's gonna know it when I'm asked to join the Academy tomorrow.\nVapor Trail: But not if you don't practice...!\nSky Stinger: Heh. I wouldn't be surprised if they asked me to become a Wonderbolt straight out of the trials. Boom, dream achieved.\nVapor Trail: [squealing] Sky, you're not as good as you think you are! [gasps]\n[beat]\nSky Stinger: What did you say?\nVapor Trail: [sighs] Sky, I want you to get in as much as anypony, and you're amazing, but...\nSky Stinger: But what?\nVapor Trail: I've been... helping you.\nSky Stinger: [scoffs] Puh-lease! I don't need your help! Watch! [straining]\nRainbow Dash: Gyuh...\n[thud]\nSky Stinger: [panting] How can you do this to me? Did you all know? Oh, great. So everypony but me knows I'm a joke. Was this your plan the whole time? To embarrass me?\nVapor Trail: What? No! Don't you know me at all?\nSky Stinger: I guess not, since it took me this long to find out you're a terrible wingpony!\nVapor Trail: [gasps] I can't believe you!\nSky Stinger: I can't believe I was ever your friend!\n[whoosh]\nVapor Trail: Thanks a lot.\n\n[Dizzitron whirring]\nRainbow Dash: Do you think they're still mad?\n[beat]\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, they're still mad.\nTwilight Sparkle: This is all my fault. If we'd just done things your way, maybe we could have avoided this whole mess.\nRainbow Dash: No, it's my fault. It hit me when I was watching Sky train with you. He wasn't even trying!\n[Dizzitron whirring]\n[thud]\nRainbow Dash: Oh, no. He's lost his confidence.\nSpitfire: Do you want to tell me why one of my most promising students is flying like a balloon with a hole in it?!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, it's a long story, but we'll fix it.\nSpitfire: Yes, you will. [blows whistle]\n[thud]\nRainbow Dash: [groans] We really messed up, huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: I have a plan.\n\nSky Stinger: [straining]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey, Sky. I thought I might find you here.\nSky Stinger: Well, apparently, I need a lot of practice. Guess I'm not the natural I thought I was.\nTwilight Sparkle: No, you're not.\nSky Stinger: [sarcastic] Thanks. Good pep talk.\nTwilight Sparkle: I wasn't a natural at friendship. But with some practice and help from my friends, I got better, and now I'm the Princess of Friendship!\nSky Stinger: So you're saying I can be the... Princess of Flying?\n\n[whoosh]\nRainbow Dash: You know, you're really good. You're lead pony material.\nVapor Trail: Hm. That's sweet of you, but no. I couldn't handle all the attention.\nRainbow Dash: But you'll never become a Wonderbolt if you're too afraid to shine. That is what you want, right?\nVapor Trail: Well, not at first. I just wanted to be with Sky. But learning to do all those fun tricks with you? It made me realize this is something I want for myself!\nRainbow Dash: I was hoping you'd say that. Come with me.\n\nSky Stinger: What's she doing here?\nRainbow Dash: Sky, Vapor was never trying to steal your spotlight. She thought she was helping you.\nTwilight Sparkle: And Vapor, you shouldn't have been so content to take a back seat.\nRainbow Dash: Now, you can either stay mad, or help each other and become two of the greatest flyers the Wonderbolt Academy has ever seen! [beat] Please pick the second option. I don't want Spitfire to be mad at me.\n[whoosh]\n\n[wind blowing]\nVapor Trail: You got this, Sky!\n\nSky Stinger: Focus on a cloud when you spin! It'll help you fly straight when you come out of it!\nVapor Trail: Uh-huh!\n[whoosh]\n\n[scribbling]\n[whoosh]\n[stopwatch ticking]\nVapor Trail: [whooping]\n[tires screeching]\n\n[whoosh]\nSky Stinger: Whoo, yeah!

You've both made it into the Wonderbolt Academy!\n[flump]\nSpitfire: Whatever you did, it worked. They still have a lot of potential. Who knows? They might even be better than you, Crash.\nRainbow Dash: [laughing] Okay, let's not get carried away.\nAngel Wings: Um, I just wanted you to know, you two are my new favorite ponies in all of Equestria.\nRainbow Dash: Hey, I heard that!\nVapor Trail: I can't believe we did it!\nSky Stinger: You were great! Even though you can out-fly me, you can be my wingpony anytime.\nVapor Trail: Aw. [chuckles] And you can be mine.\n[cutie marks ringing]\n\n[doors open]\nRainbow Dash: [spine clicking]\n[doors close]\nTwilight Sparkle: Phew. It's good to be home.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] You're telling me. Now we can finally catch up with some Daring Do, I can make cider with Applejack\u2014\n[knocking]\n[door opens]\nMisty Fly: Dash! I've been looking all over for you! Wonderbolt emergency! We got to get back to HQ.\nRainbow Dash: You've gotta be kidding me! I was just there!

Got to keep the new books front and center! Thank you both for your help.\nStarlight Glimmer: Are you kidding? After all you've done for me, this is the least I can do.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, please. I haven't done that much.\nStarlight Glimmer: Nah. You just taught me the value of friendship. Not much at all.\nTwilight Sparkle: I may have offered some guidance, but you are responsible for the pony you've become. I'm proud to call you my student and my friend. Now we just need to get rid of these boxes. Spike, can you\u2014? Spike?\nSpike: What's that?\nTwilight Sparkle: Is it a bird?\nStarlight Glimmer: Is it a parasprite?\nSpike: It's... it's... incoming!\n[crash]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. I usually get letters by dragon.\nSpike: It is the fastest way to get mail!\nStarlight Glimmer: For me? Who'd be sending me a letter? It's... the ponies from my old village.\nTwilight Sparkle: Are they in danger?\nSpike: Are they upset with you?\nStarlight Glimmer: No... It's worse! They've invited me to the annual Sunset Festival!\n\n[theme song]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: [exhales] Uh, hey there, everypony.\nParty Favor: Uh... Hey, Starlight. What are you doing here?\nStarlight Glimmer: I-I... I was invited. To the Sunset Festival?\nDouble Diamond: Uh, yeah, but we didn't think you'd actually show up.\nParty Favor: You didn't think we really wanted you here, did you?\n[paper tearing]\nStarlight Glimmer: But... I... apologized. I thought everything was fine.\nDouble Diamond and Party Favor: [laughing derisively]\nVillage ponies: [increasingly deranged laughter]\nStarlight Glimmer: Please...! Stop...! Stop!\n[beat]\nStarlight Glimmer: What happened? Is anypony there? Princess Luna? W-What are you doing here?\nPrincess Luna: Dreams are my domain, Starlight Glimmer. I am here because you need me to be.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh. It's only a dream.\nPrincess Luna: It may only be a dream, but the feelings in it are real.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] Great. So I guess I'm more afraid of going back to the village than I thought. What do I do now?\nPrincess Luna: I have been helped time and time again by six very special ponies. They helped me overcome my past. You're fortunate to have them as friends. I suggest you share your concerns with them. I see much of myself in you, Starlight Glimmer, and I can tell you from personal experience that things do indeed get better.\n[magic zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: [gasps]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: ...and Princess Luna said I should tell you all how I was feeling. So... there it is. I'm afraid to go back to the village for the celebration.\nRarity: But why, darling? You went back to apologize. They accepted. Everypony has moved on.\nStarlight Glimmer: But have they? They don't really know how much I've changed. Or even worse, maybe I haven't changed as much as I think I have!\nRainbow Dash: Trust me. You are a totally different pony now. I mean, you were pretty awful.\nApplejack: Rainbow Dash!\nRainbow Dash: What? She was! It's a compliment!\nFluttershy: I don't think they would've sent the invitation if they didn't want you to come. I'm sure they'd be happy to see you.\nPinkie Pie: And getting an invitation to a party and not going?! That's like... I-It's like...! Well, I don't know what it's like, but it is definitely bad.\nApplejack: Just be honest with them. I'm sure they'll understand where you're comin' from.\nTwilight Sparkle: I understand how hard this is for you. Maybe if you took a friend along, it might make things easier. Somepony you trust who would look out for you?\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Thanks so much for doing this, Trixie. When Twilight said I should bring a friend, you were the first pony I thought of.\nTrixie: Great idea, Princess Twilight. Asking me \u2013 Starlight's best friend \u2013 to help her on this difficult journey really shows how wise a princess you have become.\nTwilight Sparkle: [through gritted teeth] Thanks, Trixie. [hushed, to Spike] I was talking about me.\nStarlight Glimmer: The festival lasts a whole week, but I'm sure we won't stay that long.\nTrixie: Oh. I don't know, Starlight.

The town where you\u2014\nStarlight Glimmer: Magically stole everypony's cutie marks, replaced them with equal signs, and forced them all to hide their natural talents? Yes.\nTrixie: I was going to say where you came from, but yours is a more... emotionally traumatic answer.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] I just want to... blend in. Be just another pony in the crowd enjoying the Sunset Festival with my friend.\nTrixie: Sounds good to me! And if things get weird for you, just let me know. I've got your flank.\nStarlight Glimmer: Is that a promise?\nTrixie: Not just a promise. A great and powerful promise!\n[bamf]\nTrixie: [coughing]\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, I couldn't ask for more than that. If we're gonna do this, let's do it.\n\nDouble Diamond: Oh! Starlight, you came!\nStarlight Glimmer: [nervous giggle]\nParty Favor: We were worried you wouldn't be able to make it! Are you staying the whole week? We have different events planned each day!\nSugar Belle: How is it living in a castle?\nDouble Diamond: It is so\u00a0good to see you!\nTrixie: [mock-whisper] Oh, yeah. These ponies are terrifying. [giggles]\nStarlight Glimmer: [small groan] It's good to see all of you, too.\nParty Favor: You got here just in time. We were having some debate about these banners. Which do you think feels more \"sunsetty\"?\nStarlight Glimmer: O-Oh, you don't need me to decide that. Heh. Whatever you think is probably best.\nDouble Diamond: Uh, well, how about helping us with the routes for the relay races tomorrow? Can you take a look?\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, I-I shouldn't. You all go ahead. I-I just want to enjoy the festival.\nSugar Belle: But you will be a judge for the baking competition, right?\nDouble Diamond: We had a few questions about the order of the acts for the talent show.\nNight Glider: And the unicorns have a fireworks show planned! We could really use your help!\n[villagers chattering loudly]\n[magic zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: No!

Good night, fillies and gentlefoals!\n[bamf]\n[villagers coughing]\n[villagers shocked muttering]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Ugh! I was horrible when I led that town! I was ready for them to not trust me, but... I wasn't ready for them to put me in charge again! With my past, I should never be in charge of anything!\nTrixie: So you messed up. Big deal. [hushed] Don't you ever tell another pony I said this, but even Trixie's made mistakes. [giggles] I know! The trick is to just move on and pretend they never happened.\nStarlight Glimmer: I feel like that's almost good advice.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Hey, uh, Pinkie Pie!\nPinkie Pie: Hey... [beat] you!\nStarlight Glimmer: So... you're probably wondering why I'm back so soon.\nPinkie Pie: Where were you?\nStarlight Glimmer: I... went to my old village? For the festival?\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, sounds fun! How was it?\nStarlight Glimmer: It was kind of a disaster. I came back early because I freaked out!\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, sounds awful! Bye!\nStarlight Glimmer: That was... strange.\nTrixie: Isn't she always strange?\nStarlight Glimmer: Yeah, but not like that. Hey! I'm back early.\nRarity: Ah. Welcome back?\nStarlight Glimmer: Have you two noticed Pinkie acting a little strange?\nApplejack: Pinkie Pie always acts strange.\nTrixie: Told you.\nStarlight Glimmer: Anyway, I wanted to talk to all of you. Things didn't go the way I thought they were going to go at the Sunset Festival.\nRarity: What happened?\nStarlight Glimmer: I kind of freaked out and ran out of the village.\nApplejack and Rarity: [laughing]\nApplejack: You freaked out and ran away from a festival? Ha! That's the funniest danged thing I've heard all day.\nRarity: [laughing] Oh my. Let me guess. The decorations were terrifying!\nApplejack and Rarity: [inconsiderate laughter]\nFluttershy: [whispering] ...Applejack for friendship business.\nRainbow Dash: Hello, ponies. We need Rarity and Applejack. Very important friendship business.\nTrixie: I have to say, I'm really not as impressed with your friends as the rest of Equestria is.\nStarlight Glimmer: I need to talk to Twilight!\n\n[door creaking]\n[knocking]\nStarlight Glimmer: Twilight? Hello?\nSpike: What do you want? Twilight's very busy!\nStarlight Glimmer: Spike, I really need to speak with her.\nSpike: Make an appointment! She's a princess, after all!\n[hatch slams]\n[knocking]\nStarlight Glimmer: What's wrong with you? Why are you being so\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: Rude? I think a certain dragon didn't get his nap today.\nSpike: Yeah, right. Whatever.\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry. He's been acting a little off all day. I think he missed a meal or something.\nStarlight Glimmer: He's not the only one. Everypony's acting a little strange today.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, it's definitely been one of those days! How are you?\nStarlight Glimmer: Not great, actually. You're probably wondering why I'm back from the village so early.\nTwilight Sparkle: I didn't want to bring it up, but yeah, it did seem strange. Did it not go well?\nStarlight Glimmer: The townsponies kept asking me things, like they expected me to be in charge again. But being a leader is the last thing I should ever be. So we left. Very suddenly. In a literal puff of smoke.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow, you should definitely never go back to that village.\nStarlight Glimmer: What?\nTwilight Sparkle: If you were worried about what they thought of you before, it's probably way worse now. I'd cut my losses.\nStarlight Glimmer: That's... surprising advice, coming from you.\nTwilight Sparkle: Trust me. I'm the Princess of Friendship. You don't need those ponies. You can always make more friends.\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ah! Speaking of friends, if you'll excuse me, important business to attend to!\n[door closes]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Cut my losses? That can't be right.\n\n[tumbleweeds rolling]\n[doors open]\nStarlight Glimmer: Hey, I wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier. Party Favor, can you hear me?\nTwilight Sparkle: I told you you can never speak to them again!\nStarlight Glimmer: What are you all doing here?\nTwilight Sparkle: Making sure you do what I said! I'm your teacher, aren't I? Didn't I say to never come back here?!\nStarlight Glimmer: Yes, but that just doesn't seem right. You aren't acting like yourself.\nStarlight Glimmer and Princess Luna: Something is wrong!\n[wind blows]\nStarlight Glimmer: A dream? This is another dream!\nPrincess Luna: [whispering] Starlight Glimmer...!\nStarlight Glimmer: Princess Luna?\nPrincess Luna: Starlight Glimmer!\nStarlight Glimmer: Princess Luna, where are you?\nPrincess Luna: Starlight Glimmer, there is no time! You must get help!\nStarlight Glimmer: What? What are you talking about? This is just a dream!\nPrincess Luna: Not here! In the waking world! They've taken my sister and I! It's worse than the last time! Your dream called to me, and I was able to break through! You must find help!\nStarlight Glimmer: What are you saying?! Who's taken you?!\nPrincess Luna: Be careful who you trust! You need all the help you can find! The changelings have returned and\u2014 [gasps]\nStarlight Glimmer: Princess Luna!\n\nStarlight Glimmer: [panting] They're back!\n\n[bushes rustling]\n[knocking]\nStarlight Glimmer: Trixie?

What time is it?\nStarlight Glimmer: It's late. I think I figured out what's wrong with my friends!\nTrixie: [yawning] I have a whole list of things that are wrong with your friends. We can go over it in the morning.\nStarlight Glimmer: No, Trixie, we're in danger!\n[door opens]\nTrixie: [sighs] Okay, fine! Aside from lack of sleep, how are we in danger?\nStarlight Glimmer: I think the\u2014!

What did you say?\nTrixie: That even Trixie's made mistakes! Okay? Are you happy?!\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] Yes. Sorry. I just had to make sure you weren't... [hushed] one of them!\nTrixie: [hushed] One of who?\nStarlight Glimmer: A changeling! I think they've taken Princess Celestia and Princess Luna!\nTrixie: What?! Are you sure?! I mean, what do we\u2014? We have to tell Twilight!\nStarlight Glimmer: If I'm right, then it's too late for that.\n\nMain cast: [unintelligible mutterings]\n[thwack]\nSpike: [yelps]\n[thwack]\nSpike: [groans]\nRarity: [inconsiderate laughter]\nTwilight Sparkle: Is it ready?\nApplejack: Just one more.\n[magic energy crackling]\nStarlight Glimmer: Queen Chrysalis!\nQueen Chrysalis: Ugh.

Now report!\nChangeling: Everything here is going according to plan! We've replaced the six ponies and their dragon, and have taken control of the castle!\nQueen Chrysalis: Excellent. And I've just received word that the princesses from Canterlot have successfully been replaced as well.\nChangelings: [laughing]\nQueen Chrysalis: We thought too small last time.

But maybe just stay over there for now, okay?\nStarlight Glimmer: What did you mean there's no help? Did the changelings get Cadance too?\nThorax: They took Cadance, Shining Armor, and Flurry Heart! Sunburst sent me here to get Princess Twilight's help, but... but it sounds like it's too late for that, too! So... what should we do?\nTrixie: Yeah, Starlight.

None of us knew we weren't going to be able to use magic.\nThorax: I did.\nStarlight Glimmer: If we get separated, it might make sense to have a way to make sure we are who we say we are.\nDiscord: Oh! Like a secret code! How about if I say \"we are\" and you say \"doomed\"? Or you say \"rescue\" and I say... [flails]\nTrixie: How about if we say \"klutzy\" and you say \"draconequus\"?\nStarlight Glimmer: \"Klutzy draconequus\". Works for me.\nThorax: I'll definitely remember it.\n\nTrixie: Okay. I am definitely glad you came. I don't think we'd be able to find our way without you.\nThorax: You definitely wouldn't.\n[rock creaking]\nTrixie: Um, where's the way out?\nThorax: It's a changeling hive. It shifts and changes like we do, and we're the only ones who can navigate it. It's total chaos to non-changelings.\nDiscord: Well, it's decent chaos. I don't know if I'd call it \"total\".\n\nDiscord: Are we sure that I'll get my magic back when we destroy this throne thingy?\nStarlight Glimmer: If Thorax is right, then yes.\nDiscord: [sarcastic] Well, that's reassuring.\nTrixie: And how are we supposed to destroy the throne when we find it?\nStarlight Glimmer: I... don't know.\nTrixie: [sarcastic] That's reassuring.\n[rustling]\nDiscord: I don't suppose you brought any throne-destroying tools along with these useless sideshow props.\nTrixie: Asks the Lord of Chaos who can't go for a walk without whining nonstop!\nDiscord: Yes, but when the throne is destroyed, I'll be able to rip the very fabric of reality to save our friends, while you'll still be a self-absorbed, below-average illusionist!\nTrixie: Self-absorbed?! Why, you...!\nStarlight Glimmer: Cut. It. Out! I'm just barely keeping it together, and it would be wonderful if you two could actually try to help instead of bickering like foals!\nDiscord: [defeated] Okay.\nTrixie: How can we help?\nStarlight Glimmer: Don't ask me! I couldn't even handle giving advice at the Sunset Festival, and I had magic then! And the three of us are as good as useless! At least Thorax knows where we're going.\nThorax: Um, guys? I think we're lost.\nTrixie: Oh, great. We might as well just sit here and wait for the changelings to soak up all of our love or whatever gross thing it is that they do. How often do you all get hungry?\nThorax: Actually, I haven't been since I met Spike. And changelings are always hungry. We can never get enough love.\nTrixie: Well, that's just super\u2014\nStarlight Glimmer: But you aren't hungry at all now?\nThorax: Huh. Once I made a few friends, I guess I just sort of forgot about the whole feeding thing.\nStarlight Glimmer: Is that about the same time your wings changed?\nThorax: I guess so.\nDiscord: [yawns] While I would love to sit around chitchatting about feeding and not feeding, [echoing] I have a Fluttershy to save! [echoes]\n[changelings hissing]\nTrixie: [hushed] Can you please lower your voice?! You're gonna get us all captured!\nDiscord: Oh, you keep saying that, but I haven't seen an actual changeling since we got into this hive.\n[distant humming]\nTrixie: W-What's that?\nThorax: A changeling patrol!\n[changeling screeches]\nThorax: [hyperventilating]\nDiscord: This seems like one of those moments where we need a plan.\nTrixie: What kind of plan?! We have no magic, and it's not like my illusions are gonna save us!\nStarlight Glimmer: Do you have any of your smoke bombs?\nTrixie: Are you kidding?\n\n[changelings' wings buzzing]\nThorax: Looking for somepony?\n[changelings screech]\nThorax: Is that the best you've got?! [laughing]\n[various poofs]\nDiscord: Not exactly great and powerful, but effective.\nTrixie: Hm. I'll take it.\nStarlight Glimmer: \"Klutzy\"...\nTrixie and Thorax: ...\"draconequus\"!\n[transformation zap]\nDiscord: Ugh. I really think we need a new code word!\nThorax: That was a pretty good plan.\nTrixie: But we still don't know where we're going.\nStarlight Glimmer: Actually, we might. Two of the changelings didn't go with the rest.\nThorax: Oh! With an intruder in the hive, they went to protect the queen! Good thinking, Starlight!\nStarlight Glimmer: [embarrassed laugh]\n\n[changelings' wings buzzing]\nTrixie: Now what?\nStarlight Glimmer: We... go in.\nThorax: Even if I wanted to, there's no way past the guards. We'll be spotted for sure.\nStarlight Glimmer: We need some kind of... distraction.\nTrixie: I'm fresh out of smoke bombs.\nDiscord: Normally, I'm the most distracting thing I can think of, but without magic...\nStarlight Glimmer: You shouldn't underestimate yourself.\n\n[doors closing]\nDiscord: [taps microphone] Hello, changelings and changelettes! Believe me, I was just as surprised as you are that I'm here! When I heard that I'd be playing for a bunch of changelings, I was beside myself! Then I realized, it was just one of you.\n[rimshot]\n[changelings snarl]\nDiscord: [nervous laugh] But, seriously, this isn't the toughest crowd I've ever been in front of. But it's definitely the easiest to bug!\n[rimshot]\nDiscord: \"To bug\"? Is this thing on? [taps microphone]\n[changelings snarl]\nDiscord: Well, if you think that you can do any better, be my guest!\n[microphone feedback]\n[changelings' wings buzzing]\nTrixie: It is absolutely ridiculous that that worked.\n\n[changelings' wings buzzing]\nDiscord: It is certainly a pleasure to have such dedicated fans. I'll have to come back with some new material after I rescue Fluttershy.\nFluttershy: [whimpers] Please, help! [whimpers]\nDiscord: Fluttershy!\nFluttershy: Discord! I'm stuck!\nDiscord: You certainly are. And I should probably help you get free. But... oh-ho-ho-ho-ho...\nFluttershy: But what?\nDiscord: But you are obviously not Fluttershy!\nFluttershy: Oh.\nDiscord: I mean, I'm separated from the group and just happen to come across the one pony I care most about? I can smell this setup a mile away.\nFluttershy: [sniffs, crying] No. You're right. There's no way you should trust me. Just go find the others. [wailing] I understand!\nDiscord: Oh, come on!\nFluttershys: [crying]\nFluttershy #1: We're probably all changelings. You shouldn't rescue any of us. Unless, you think, maybe one of us might be the real Fluttershy. Oh, that certainly would be a nasty changeling trick, wouldn't it?\nFluttershys: [crying]\nFluttershy #2: I'm the real one.\nFluttershy #3: I'm the real one.\nFluttershy #4: I'm the real Fluttershy.\n\nThorax: We can't wait for Discord. Between seeing him and Trixie, the castle will be crawling with guards soon.\nStarlight Glimmer: But if we do manage to destroy Chrysalis' throne, we'll need him. He could take on the entire changeling army by sneezing if he wanted to.\nTrixie: He's probably already been captured!\nChangeling: Hello? Fellow rescuers?\nThorax: We can't stay here. We gotta find the throne.\nChangeling: Ooh! I heard some of the changelings who were chasing me say that they know where it is!\nTrixie: \"Klutzy\"...?\nChangeling: Hmm? Oh. Yeah. [chuckling] I-I can be klutzy. Now, follow me.\nStarlight Glimmer: [whispering] You know that's not Discord, right?\nTrixie: Obviously.\nChangeling: This way! We're almost there!\nThorax: I know this trick. If he says to go left, we should definitely go right. He's leading us to a swarm waiting to attack!\nTrixie: [sighs] Okay, I'll handle it. You two just get ready to run into the other tunnel.\nStarlight Glimmer: Wait, what?! Trixie, you can't! I won't know what to do! We've already lost Discord; I can't lose you too! Without magic, I\u2014\nTrixie: Starlight. You got us this far with just my illusions and Discord's annoying personality. You don't need magic to figure out what to do next. I know you're afraid to be in charge, but you are really good at it! Listen to your best friend. Hey, Discord! Want to see the new trick I've been working on? I call it the \"Changeling Catcher\"! Run!\n[transformation zap]\n[changeling hisses]\n[changelings hissing]\nTrixie: [nervously] Ta-da...\n[changelings screech]\n\nStarlight Glimmer and Thorax: [panting]\n[changelings' wings buzzing]\n\n[splat]\nQueen Chrysalis: [laughing evilly] One little pony all by herself. [joints cracking] Oh, how will I ever prevent this daring rescue?\n[changelings screech]\n\n[changelings hiss]\nQueen Chrysalis: Well, well, well. The Princess of Friendship's sole pupil. Honestly, I didn't think you were worth replacing with one of my drones.\nThorax: [strains] You won't get away with this!\nQueen Chrysalis: I already have. Nopony is coming to save you. Your little squad was it. And now, there's just you.\nThorax: Thorax is still out there.\nQueen Chrysalis: Don't mention that traitor's name in my kingdom! He was a fool to leave and even more a fool to return! When I find him, he'll learn just what happens to those who betray the hive!\nThorax: [whimpers]\nQueen Chrysalis: And it seems I don't have far to look, do I...\nThorax: [whimpers]\n[transformation zap]\nQueen Chrysalis: Thorax?\n[changelings hiss]\n[pounding]\nStarlight Glimmer: [whimpers]\n[zap]\nQueen Chrysalis: Very clever. And clearly Thorax revealed to you the secret of my throne. I can't have powerful ponies using their abilities against me. Even with your rather embarrassing little rescue attempt, everything has gone according to my plan.\nStarlight Glimmer: What plan? Why did you do all this?!\nQueen Chrysalis: So I could feed, of course! By replacing the most beloved figures in Equestria, my drones will be able to store all the love meant for them and return it here to me. Everypony will do as I command, and my subjects and I will feed on their love for generations! [maniacal laughter]\n[changelings hissing]\nStarlight Glimmer: What if you didn't have to?\nQueen Chrysalis: Ridiculous! The hunger of changelings can never be satisfied!\nStarlight Glimmer: Exactly! Thorax left the hive and made a friend. He shared love, and now he doesn't need to feed. You don't have to live your lives starving all the time!\nQueen Chrysalis: You know nothing of the changelings or what it takes to be their queen! I decide what is best for my subjects, not some mewling grub!\nStarlight Glimmer: I know what it's like to lead by fear and intimidation! And I know what it's like to want everypony to do what you say! But I was wrong. A real leader doesn't force her subjects to deny who they are! She celebrates what makes them unique and listens when one of them finds a better way!\nQueen Chrysalis: The only thing Thorax has found is what happens to those who turn their back on the hive!\n[dark magic]\nStarlight Glimmer: No! Stop!\nQueen Chrysalis: Just as soon as I drain every last ounce of love from him and show my subjects what a real leader is!\nThorax: [straining] I can feel the love inside me slipping away...! I can't hold onto it much longer...!\nStarlight Glimmer: Then don't! Sharing love is what made you different to begin with! You should share yours with Chrysalis! Give her all of it!\n[magic blasts]\nStarlight Glimmer: This is what happens when you give love freely instead of taking it!\n[transformation sounds]\n[kaboom!]\n[music]\nDiscord: Fluttershy?\nFluttershy: It's, um, good to see you, too.\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight? What happened?\nStarlight Glimmer: We defeated the changelings with no magic at all, they found a new leader, and... they're all kinda... good now.\nPrincess Luna: Well done, Starlight Glimmer. It seems as though you've learned a great deal since we last spoke.\n[rubble moving]\nQueen Chrysalis: [hissing]\n[triumphant music]\nStarlight Glimmer: When Twilight and her friends defeated me, I chose to run away and seek revenge! You don't have to! You can be the leader your subjects deserve.\n[wind rustling]\n[smack!]\nQueen Chrysalis: There is no revenge you could ever conceive of that will come close to what I will exact upon you one day, Starlight Glimmer!\nPrincess Celestia: Thorax, as the new leader of the changelings, I look forward to discussing how we can improve our relationship in the future. However, for the moment, perhaps it is best that we leave the Changeling Kingdom to the changelings.\nDiscord: Splendid idea! Now who's ready for some celebratory tea at Fluttershy's?!\nFluttershy: Oh! Uh, everypony?\nStarlight Glimmer: Actually, now that you can snap your claws and send us absolutely anywhere again, I think I have a better option.\n\nParty Favor: Uh, hey, Starlight. What are you doing here?\nDouble Diamond: You left in such a hurry before, we kinda thought you didn't wanna come.\nStarlight Glimmer: Yeah... I guess after the way I used my magic on all of you, I wasn't sure I was somepony who should even be in charge of a baking contest. I was afraid I might go back to being the pony I used to be. But I realize that sometimes you don't have a choice. You have to step up. And I have changed! I can handle it. Whether that means saving Equestria or helping friends out with the Sunset Festival. Speaking of which, I know the Festival's almost over, but I kinda invited a few of my friends to join. Hope that's okay.\nDouble Diamond: [laughing] Are you kidding? Of course!\nStarlight Glimmer: Great! Now where's that baking contest? This pony needs a cupcake!\nDiscord: So I'm able to rip the very fabric of reality again.\nTrixie: Yeah, yeah. And I'm still a self-absorbed, below-average illusionist, right?\nDiscord: Actually, I was going to say a couple of those illusions were slightly above average. If you ever need a little chaos in your act, let me know.\nTrixie: Ha! When pigs fly!\nDiscord: Your wish is my command! [snaps]\nPigasus: [squealing]\nTrixie: Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!\nRainbow Dash: Somepony is really gonna have to catch us up on what we missed.\n\n[credits]\n"}]}, {"season": "7", "eps": [{"full_transcript": "\n[knock, knock, knock]\n[door opens]\nStarlight Glimmer: Hey, Spike. What's up?\nSpike: Just, uh, wanted to make sure you're ready for your big ceremony today.\nStarlight Glimmer: Yep!\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Wow, I still can't believe my friends and I are getting medals...\nTwilight Sparkle: Shhh!\nStarlight Glimmer: ...of honor.\nSpike: Are you kidding? You totally deserve it! After all, you... saved Equestria from... Queen Chrysalis! With the help of Trixie and Thorax and Discord and...\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, yeah. I know what happened. I was kinda there.\nSpike: Uh, right. Uh, so... what are you wearin'?\nStarlight Glimmer: Not sure. Why? Am I supposed to dress up?\nSpike: No! I-I mean, you could. It's like Rarity always says... [imitating Rarity] \"There's no such thing as overdressed, darling. You're just the best-looking pony in the room.\" [chuckles]\nStarlight Glimmer: What are you looking at?\nSpike: No, don't look!\n[teleportation zap]\nSpike: 'Cause there was a spider there, but it's, uh, gone now, so, uh... thanks, Starlight! Byeeee!\n[zip]\nStarlight Glimmer: Huh?\n[door closes]\n\nSpike: Ha-ha! She had no idea. We're a good team, Sparkle!\nTwilight Sparkle: \"Sparkle\"? [laughs] Yeah, we are. So do you think she'll like it? I want this present to say, \"I'm so proud of you both as a mentor and a friend. Equestria is safer thanks to you.\"\nSpike: Oh. I thought you were getting her a mirror like yours.\nTwilight Sparkle: I am.\nSpike: Uh, maybe you should get her a card 'cause I don't think the mirror will say all that. But I think she'll like it.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's just what her room needs. The first thing she'll see when she wakes up is herself surrounded by all her friends. I plan on giving it to her after the ceremony.\nSpike: Yeah, about that. Don't you need to get the castle ready for the celebration?\nTwilight Sparkle: Nah. Pinkie Pie's got that covered.\n\nPinkie Pie: Hmmm.\n[party cannon squeak]\nPinkie Pie: Phew!\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight, Trixie, Thorax, and Discord were brave in the face of danger, resourceful when things got challenging, and proved that the bonds of friendship, no matter how unlikely, are stronger than any adversity. By stopping Queen Chrysalis, not only did they save Equestria; they set the changelings free from her reign.\n[zap]\nDiscord: Go, Discord! Yahoo! [laughs]\nStarlight Glimmer: [giggles]\nPrincess Celestia: And that's why we're proud and honored to give them the Equestrian Pink Hearts of Courage!\n[cheers and applause]\n[pop]\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! Oh. Uh, no. Not quite. Uh... all right. There it is!\n[pop]\nPinkie Pie: Yay!\nTwilight Sparkle: We are so proud of you all!\n[cheers and applause]\n\n[house music playing]\nTrixie: It was the Great and Powerful Trrrrixie's pleasure to save you from your imminent doom.\nDiscord: Yes, because you did it all by yourself.\nStarlight Glimmer: [giggles]\nSunburst: I can't believe you managed to do it without magic.\nChangeling: It was amazing!\nChangeling: No one's ever stood up to Chrysalis like that!\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, I just did what anypony would have done.\nPrincess Celestia: It's a wonderful feeling, isn't it? Watching your student shine the way you always knew they could.\nTwilight Sparkle: [laughs] My cheeks are sore! I don't think I've ever smiled this much in my life!\nPrincess Celestia: I can only imagine what that feels like.\nDiscord: Yes, Starlight is student of the year, isn't she? She has so much potential. So, what are we going to do with her? And by \"we\", I definitely mean \"you\". Being her mentor and all that, her destiny falls squarely on your haunches.\n[teleportation zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, don't you worry. I've planned enough friendship lessons to cover the next three years.\nDiscord: [laughs]\nTwilight Sparkle: What's so funny?\nDiscord: No, no. Clearly, Starlight is beyond basic friendship lessons. She just won a medal, for Equestria's sake. I thought you were joking. You are joking, right?\nTwilight Sparkle: [nervous laugh] Of course I was.\nDiscord: Obviously, you should have a grand master plan for her, the same way Celestia set you on the path that eventually made you a princess.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yep.\nDiscord: Oh, good. I'm sure she can't wait to hear all about it.\n[zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: [nervous noise]\nStarlight Glimmer: So how's the whole ruling-a-kingdom thing going?\nThorax: It's a bit overwhelming. But we're adjusting.\nChangeling Girl: So, uh, you can't have friendship without makeovers?\nApplejack: Eh, not-not exactly.\nDiscord: Oh, Starlight. Princess Twilight has something very important to tell us. Well, just you, really, but I'm nosy and I want to hear.\nStarlight Glimmer: Okay. Would you excuse m\u2014?\n[zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Never mind. What's going on?\nDiscord: Well, Twilight was just about to reveal her grand master plan for you.\nStarlight Glimmer: Really? I was kind of wondering what we were gonna do next.\nDiscord: Yes. I'd say we were both fairly interested.\nTwilight Sparkle: [nervous] Of course you are. And I do have a plan, obviously. But now is clearly not the time to do it. You should enjoy your party. [sips punch]\nTrixie: Starlight, come on! The Ponyville Chronicle wants to take our picture! Ugh. You, too, Discord.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sipping punch, sighs]\n[zap]\nDiscord: Psst! I see what you're doing.\nTwilight Sparkle: You do?\nDiscord: You already planned the perfect moment during the party to make the grand announcement to everypony about your plan. Brava, Twilight! I can't wait to tell your plan to Fluttershy and the others!\n[zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: Discord, no!\n\n[door creaks]\nSpike: Twilight, are you reading during a party... again?\n[papers rustling]\nTwilight Sparkle: No, no, no! She's already good at that! She mastered this! She taught me about this one!\nSpike: Wild guess \u2013 something's wrong.\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, I'm a terrible mentor! Why didn't I come up with a path for Starlight? Princess Celestia had it all figured out for me! [gasps] That's it! [excited squeal]\nSpike: Whoa!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I had years worth of friendship lessons ready to go, but when we were captured by Chrysalis, Starlight took charge and really stepped up. I don't think friendship lessons are enough for her anymore.\nPrincess Celestia: So you have an overachieving student. Sounds familiar.\nSpike: [chuckles]\nTwilight Sparkle: That's why I had to talk to you. You, of all ponies, would know what to do. I mean, you were me and I was Starlight. But, for now, I need you to pretend you're you and I'm me.\nSpike: Huh?\nPrincess Celestia: Heh. Go on.\nTwilight Sparkle: When I was your student, and you were in this place, you\u2014 Oh, no! You sent me to Ponyville! Which means it's time for me to send Starlight Glimmer away!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't believe it! It's really time for Starlight to go, isn't it?\nPrincess Celestia: Only you can make that decision. It's a difficult one, but your heart knows what's right, even as it hurts.\nSpike: Where're you gonna send her? Uh, too soon?\nTwilight Sparkle: No. This is something I have to do. Oh, boy.\n\nFluttershy: Oh, boy!\nDiscord: Whatever Twilight's planning for Starlight is going to be so exciting!\nApplejack: Hmm. Wonder why she didn't tell any of us about it.\nDiscord: Probably because you're not as close as you think you are. [laughs] Just kidding. She wanted it to be a big surprise. Just between us, she's getting ready to make a big announcement!\nPinkie Pie: [squeals] That's so exciting! And surprising. Usually, you tell your party planner about all your plans for your party.\nRainbow Dash: Well, she definitely has one. I mean when has Twilight not had a plan?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [low muttering] Gosh, I don't know... I just don't want to send her to the wrong place... [sighs] I just, I just don't know... [gasps] I got it! Since defeating Chrysalis, Starlight's given the changelings an opportunity to revolutionize their society. Maybe I can send her there.\n[magic sounds]\nSpike: Cool spell.\nTwilight Sparkle: If Starlight goes to the changeling hive, she can help them adjust to their new way of life.\nStarlight Glimmer: Okay, Friendship 101. Thorax and I are going to show you how to compromise.\nThorax: [stiltedly] I want to have honeysuckle nectar for lunch.\nStarlight Glimmer: [stiltedly] I would like a sandwich. Oh, no. What should we do?\nChangeling 1: Attack! The winner gets to choose!\n[changelings clamoring in agreement]\nStarlight Glimmer: Or... Thorax and I can talk about it and come up with a solution that works for everypony.\nThorax: [stiltedly] Starlight, how do you feel about honeysuckle and peanut butter sandwiches?\nStarlight Glimmer: [stiltedly] Why, that sounds dee-licious!\nStarlight Glimmer and Thorax: Compromise.\n[changelings clamoring in agreement]\nSpike: Uh, this doesn't seem like something Starlight and Thorax would do.\nPrincess Celestia: Uh, this is Twilight's fantasy, Spike. There is no wrong way to fantasize.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you.\nChangeling 1: Starlight Glimmer is a most apt and perspicacious pony!\nSpike: Yep. Definitely a Twilight fantasy.\nPrincess Celestia: This seems like a lovely path for Starlight. The changelings have so much to learn about how to enjoy love through friendships. Starlight would be busy for a very long time, but her work there would be very rewarding.\nTwilight Sparkle: Or dangerous. It would only take one changeling to deviate from the pack.\n[transformation noise]\nGoofy Changeling: [evil laugh] Hi, I'm Starlight Glimmer! What's your name?\nCornicle: Uh, Cornicle?\nGoofy Changeling: [laughs] What kind of name is that? Ah, your wings are so, um... see-through. I'm so glad I'm a pony. Are you, like, bugs, or what?\n[zap]\n[swat, swat, swat]\nCornicle: [gasps] There she is! Get her!\n[changelings clamoring angrily]\nSpike: Uh, that probably won't happen.\nTwilight Sparkle: But it could! I can't just send her off to Celestia-knows-where without thinking it through!\nPrincess Celestia: Hmm. I was not aware that I was an expression. An appropriate one, of course, for even I don't know the answer. This is a momentous decision. You must consider all the possibilities.\nTwilight Sparkle: Rethink, rethink, rethink! What about the dragons? I can send Starlight to the Dragon Lands! She and Ember would totally hit it off!\n[magic sounds]\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Ember!\nPrincess Ember: Starlight!\nStarlight Glimmer and Princess Ember: [grunt]\nPrincess Ember: You ready to do some death-defying dragon stuff?\nStarlight Glimmer: Ah, totally!\nSpike: Okay, that doesn't sound anything like Ember or Starlight.\nTwilight Sparkle: Who knows what their dynamic would be, Spike?\n[zaps and torches]\nSpike: [gasps]\n[tap, tap]\nSpike: Freaky.\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight will love it in the Dragon Lands. In her letters, Ember said dragons do a lot of fun things. The Feast of Fire, the Dragon Bowl, Claw-chella.\nStarlight Glimmer: Whoo! [laughs]\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight could be there for a really long time. But then again, not all dragons like ponies as much as Ember does.\nGarble: Hey, Twinkle Star!\nStarlight Glimmer: It's, uh, Starlight Glimmer.\nGarble: Star-kle Light-star?\nStarlight Glimmer: Starlight. Glimmer.\nGarble: Yeah, whatever. You wanna hang with us?\n[whoosh]\nStarlight Glimmer: What are we diving into?\nGarble: Lava!\nStarlight Glimmer: What?!\nSpike: Twilight, this is crazy!\n[magic sounds]\nSpike: Starlight's really good with magic. She could just stop herself from falling into a pit of lava.\nTwilight Sparkle: What if she didn't realize it was happening?! You just never know, Spike! I just need to think of someplace safe to send her! Someplace safe, someplace safe, someplace safe... I could send her to the Crystal Empire to continue her magical studies with Sunburst!\n[magic sounds]\nTwilight Sparkle: It'll be perfect! Sunburst's knowledge of magic is only matched by Starlight's abilities.\nSunburst: I've got it! Try placing your horn directly on the potion and picture the clock you wish to make.\n[magic noises]\n[dong, cuckoo, dong, cuckoo]\nTwilight Sparkle: They could challenge each other into becoming the most talented unicorns Equestria's ever seen!\nStarlight Glimmer: We did it! Quick, what's next?\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course, the study of magic is a lifelong pursuit, and Starlight could be there for a while, especially once they start attempting the really complicated stuff!\nSpike: Three, two, one...\nTwilight Sparkle: What if they become too ambitious?!\n\nStarlight Glimmer: I never would've thought to combine Star Swirl's apparition spell with Spacium Flexibus! But what would happen if we added Somnambula's Tempus Objectus?\nSunburst: If we do it just right, it should allow us to materialize an object that was lost in the past.\n[chalk drawing]\nTwilight Sparkle: No! Don't do it!\n[whoosh!]\nStarlight Glimmer: [screams]\nSunburst: [screams]\nStarlight Glimmer: [screams]\nSunburst and Twilight Sparkle: Starlight, noooooo!\nSpike: Twilight, snap out of it!\n[magic sounds]\nSpike: Easy, Twilight. It didn't happen.\nTwilight Sparkle: But it could! I just don't think I can send her anywhere. What am I gonna do?\nPrincess Celestia: [laughs heartily]\nTwilight Sparkle: Are you laughing at me?\n\nPrincess Celestia: [continues laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't believe you're laughing at me.\nPrincess Celestia: Oh, Twilight, I'm not. I'm laughing because I had the exact same fears you're having.\nTwilight Sparkle: What?!\nPrincess Celestia: Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a very bright young filly.\n\nPrincess Celestia: [voiceover] She was truly one of my best students.\nSpike: [voiceover] Are you talking about Twilight? I can't see what you're thinking about.\nPrincess Celestia: [voiceover] Yes, Spike. I was constantly surprised and impressed with her discoveries. But I noticed that her pursuit of academia was preventing her from reaching her full potential.\nSpike: [voiceover] You mean it was keeping her isolated and alone?\nPrincess Celestia: [voiceover] Uh, yes, Spike. I had a decision to make. Oh, but it wasn't easy.\n\nPrincess Celestia: Maybe I could close the library or throw a party in the castle. Oh, she'd have to talk to the other fillies then! Oh. I must send her away.\n\nPrincess Celestia: [voiceover] I knew there was a special group of fillies in Ponyville, but I kept inventing all kinds of reasons why I shouldn't send you.\n\nPrincess Celestia: What if she runs into a manticore? Or what if she gets pulled into Tartarus? Or, worst of all, what if she doesn't get along with anypony?!\nGuard 1: Are we supposed to say something?\nGuard 2: I don't think so.\n\nPrincess Celestia: [voiceover] I kept you in Canterlot longer than I should have.\n\nPrincess Celestia: Eventually, I realized all the anxiety I felt was because I didn't want you to go.\nTwilight Sparkle: Really?\nPrincess Celestia: I loved having you as a student. You challenged me and taught me just as much as I taught you. I am embarrassed to admit it, but I was afraid if you made friends, you wouldn't need me anymore.\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Celestia, that is so not true. I will always need you.\nPrincess Celestia: I think Starlight Glimmer might feel the same way about you. If that is what you're afraid of.\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe it is. Just a little.\nSpike: [chuckles] Oh, it definitely is. Like, a lot.\nPrincess Celestia: Here we are after all these years, Twilight. We are living proof that letting someone spread their wings doesn't mean you no longer have a place in their lives.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you.\nPrincess Celestia: And if you're still worried, you can always make her write you letters.\nSpike: [chuckles]\n\n[ponies conversing]\n[spotlight turns on]\n[boom mic bump]\nDiscord: I may have let it slip that you'd be unveiling your big plan for Starlight tonight. Silly me. But we're all very excited to hear what you've cooked up.\n[beat]\nDiscord: You weren't coming up with a plan just now, were you? Oh, dear. This could be pretty embarrassing for you.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sarcastically] Gee, thanks, Discord.\nDiscord: Anytime. I really do love being helpful.\n[zap]\n[clink, clink, clink]\nTwilight Sparkle: If I could have everypony's attention! As you all know, Starlight Glimmer's been my pupil for a while now, and I'd hoped she'd be my pupil for a long time yet to come. But it turns out that's just not meant to be.\n[ponies gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight, you have proved yourself to be a kind, loyal, strong, honest, and truly magical friend. Just looking around this room at all the new friendships you've made, I know there's nothing more I need to teach you. So we have a second reason to celebrate today. Three cheers for Starlight Glimmer on her graduation day!\n[ponies cheering]\nPinkie Pie: [squeals, giggles] What a great surprise!\nTwilight Sparkle: [to Starlight] The future's in your own hooves now.\nStarlight Glimmer: Wow. I was not expecting this!\nTrixie and Thorax: Mmm... [giggles]\nDiscord: Darn it. I was hoping you would send her to my realm. We could've been roomies. Way to not pick up what I was putting down.\nTrixie: How do you want to celebrate? Girls' trip to Las Pegasus?\nThorax: We could throw you a changeling Gorbfest! Uh, it's more fun than it sounds.\n[tap, tap]\nDiscord: Or we could go cause a little mischief. I know a trick that'll turn Celestia's castle into cheese. Do you think it's a \"gouda\" idea? [laughs] That's just the first of many cheese jokes if we go down this path.\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, that all sounds wonderful. But, um, give me a minute, would ya?\nTwilight Sparkle and Spike: [giggling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Congratulations.\nStarlight Glimmer: Thanks.\nTwilight Sparkle: So how do you feel?\nStarlight Glimmer: Happy, surprised, overwhelmed. I mean, not that I'm not grateful, but are you sure?\nTwilight Sparkle: Believe me. I've thought long and hard about this.\nStarlight Glimmer: Of course you did.\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight, trust me. You're ready.\nStarlight Glimmer: Yeah!\n[beat]\nStarlight Glimmer: No, I'm not.\nTwilight Sparkle: What are you talking about?\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm not ready to leave!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, good! 'Cause I'm not ready for that either! Here! I got you this present. It was going to be a \"congrats on getting a medal of honor\" present, but then I was afraid it would have to be a going-away present, but now it's an \"I couldn't be happier you're staying\" present! It fits perfectly over your dresser! I know. I measured.\nStarlight Glimmer: Thank you.\nTwilight Sparkle: I may not know what comes next for you, but whatever it is, I promise I'll always be there for you.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh.\n[indistinct conversations]\n\n[whoosh]\n[wheeling in]\n[vacuum whirring]\nPinkie Pie: Phee-yew!\n\n[end credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nTrixie: Come on, come on!

I can't put a trick that's not working into my act! How come it's not working?\nStarlight Glimmer: It could be because you're just yelling \"teacup!\" and not picturing it in your mind.\nTrixie: Oh. Yeah, that could be it.\nStarlight Glimmer: What does your teacup look like? What shape is it? What color?\nTrixie: [inhales]\n[magic zaps]\nTrixie: Whoo!

[as Starlight Glimmer] \"Yay, Trixie! You're so great at magic and having good hair!\"\nStarlight Glimmer: [chuckles] Good job, Trix. But I was baking these to give to Twilight and the girls for their friendship retreat. Pinkie Pie gave me a recipe and everything.\nTrixie: Oh! You need some snacks to give to Twilight? I've got you covered. [humming to herself]\n[splat]\nTrixie: Problem solved.\n[magic rumbling]\nStarlight Glimmer: [exhales] Not exactly.\n\n[theme song]\n\n[train whistle blows]\nTwilight Sparkle: I am so excited for this friendship retreat! I can't remember the last time we all got to hang out without having to save Equestria.\nRainbow Dash: Well, we are awesome. But technically, we weren't the last ponies to save Equestria.\nTwilight Sparkle: I was speaking in a broader sense. Are you sure you don't want to come with us?\nSpike: Yeah, I have three new comics to get through.\nStarlight Glimmer: And I promised Trixie we'd practice more magic. It might be better if the castle was empty, if you know what I mean.\nTrixie: [groans] Relax. If anything breaks, Starlight will just go back in time and fix it!\nStarlight Glimmer: [nervous laughter]\nTrixie: Kidding.\nStarlight Glimmer: We'll take good care of the castle while you're gone.\nTrixie: Have fun on your friendship retreat! [hushed, to Starlight] What in Equestria is a friendship retreat, anyway?\nStarlight Glimmer: [hushed] They're gonna bond, share laughs, and if I know them, they're gonna sing a song.\nTrixie: [giggles] We are gonna have so much more fun than them!\nStarlight Glimmer: [giggles] Shhh!\nTrixie: Twilight, wait! Starlight has something for you!\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh?\nStarlight Glimmer: [nervously] Here, I, um, brought you snacks...\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, how... thoughtful, thanks. We will... not get hungry on the train.\nStarlight Glimmer: It was supposed to be teacakes, but... [sighs] it's a long story. Have a great time!\nTwilight Sparkle: You, too!\n[door shuts]\n[train rattling]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Okay, Trixie, what kinds of spells did you want to work on next?\nTrixie: Well, every self-respecting magician has a disappearing act, so maybe we could start with that?\nStarlight Glimmer: Hmmm. Nothing just disappears, so that's technically a teleportation spell, and those are pretty hard. Maybe we should start with something smaller.\nTrixie: No-no-no-no. The Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie goes big or not at all! Just tell me how you do it.\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, I've always found magic is tied to my emotions. Whatever I'm feeling fuels whatever I'm doing, and the stronger I'm feeling, the stronger the magic.\nTrixie: Right. Like when you were so upset that cutie marks took away your friend, your magic was strong enough to enslave an entire village.\n[magic warbling]\nStarlight Glimmer: Yep. Thanks for bringing that up.\nTrixie: See? I'm already learning. If anypony is gonna teach me how to do a disappearing spell\u2014\nStarlight Glimmer: Teleportation spell.\nTrixie: Whatever. I'm complimenting you. And me. We can do this, 'cause we're amazing, and magic is friendship and stuff.\nStarlight Glimmer: [laughs] I guess we can give it a whirl. Now, we just need to find you something to teleport.\nTrixie: Spike! How about it?\nSpike: [nervous laugh]\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, let's pick something, I don't know, not living?\nTrixie: I mean it won't be as impressive, but okay.

It's because we get locked in a room and we have to solve puzzles and riddles in order to escape!\n\"Ginger Locks\": [bored] The clues will lead you to a key to get out.\nTwilight Sparkle: Team-building!\nFluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity: [sighs]\nApplejack: Come on, girls. This could be fun.\nTwilight Sparkle: Could be? Some of the brightest minds in Equestria put together these puzzles!\nFluttershy: I'm just happy to be with all of you.\nPinkie Pie: Me, too! I'm not great at solving riddles, but I'm super great at cheering other ponies on while they do it! Go, us! Ooo, ooo! Woo-hoo!\nRarity: Yes, yes, woo-hoo. [clears throat] But just so we know, exactly how long will we be locked in here?\n\"Ginger Locks\": [bored] A group of griffons set the record for the fastest escape. It only took them an hour.\nRainbow Dash: Hah! Griffons barely like each other! We're basically the poster ponies for amazing friendships! So get your quill ready, bub! You're gonna have to write down a new record!\n\nStarlight Glimmer: If you master this spell before the girls get back, you'd be setting some kind of record!\nTrixie: Challenge accepted!\nStarlight Glimmer: Okay. What you want to do is concentrate on the object that you want to teleport...\nSpike: Yeah, I'm gonna go... all the way over here.\nTrixie: Concentrate on teleporting. Got it.

You made Twilight's friendship map disappear!\nTrixie: [clears throat] Teleport.\nStarlight Glimmer: Really?!\nTrixie: Well, it was behind the apple. It was bound to happen. On the plus side, my magic is getting better! I made a whole table go poof! That was pretty impressive!\nStarlight Glimmer: Trixie, we have to get that map back.\nTrixie: We'll find it. No big deal.\nStarlight Glimmer: Twilight's never gonna trust me to be alone in this castle again! What were you thinking?!\nTrixie: Teleport, like you told me to.\n[magic warbling]\nStarlight Glimmer: No! You're supposed to concentrate on the object, not just teleporting!\nTrixie: [scoffs] Well, gee, you probably should have told me all the steps before you let me do the spell.\nStarlight Glimmer: I tried. [gasps] I... need a minute.\n\n[dishes clattering]\n[door opens]\n[crockery shattering]\nSpike: Hey, are you okay?\nStarlight Glimmer: I will be once I cast a spell to contain my anger in this bottle.\nSpike: Wait, what?\nStarlight Glimmer: Do you see this storm cloud? This has never happened before! All this magical energy has to go somewhere, and if I'm not using it to fight a magical duel or bend my friends' wills to obey my every command...\nSpike: Hah. I remember that.\nStarlight Glimmer: The point is, I don't know what my magic's going to do. So I'm hoping if I bottle up my anger, I won't do who-knows-what to Trixie.\nSpike: Are you sure that's a good idea?\nStarlight Glimmer: What choice do I have? I've got to get that map back, and I don't wanna lose Trixie. If she knew what I was thinking right now, she'd probably never talk to me again.\nSpike: Okay... You do what you need to do. I'll see if I can find the map somewhere in the castle.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Trixie!\nTrixie: Oh, there you are! For a minute, I didn't think you were coming back, and that you might be upset with me for some weird reason. But then I remembered \u2013 you never get mad at me.\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans]\n[magic warbling]\nStarlight Glimmer: [exhales] Nope! [laughs nervously] Not mad at all! So, the map is probably in the last place you were thinking of. Where was that?\nTrixie: Ooh, great question. I wish you'd asked it, like, right after I did the spell. I don't remember anymore.\n[magic warbling]\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans] No worries. We'll just take a walk around town. Maybe that'll jog your memory.\nTrixie: Okay, that sounds fun. Ooh!\nStarlight Glimmer: Did you remember?\nTrixie: Nope! But I did think we could stop for cinnamon nuts while we're out!\nStarlight Glimmer: Cinnamon... nuts?\n[magic warbling]\nStarlight Glimmer: That's a good idea!\nTrixie: Yes! I've been craving something sweet since I couldn't have any teacakes this morning.\nStarlight Glimmer: [exhales] You got this, Starlight...\n\nPinkie Pie: Woo-hoo! Go, Twilight! you can do it!\n[click, rattling]\nPinkie Pie: Woo-hoo!\nApplejack: Hoo-wee! You solved that triangley thing mighty fast! Uh, does anypony need a purple jewel?\nRarity: Ooh! Plum or boysenberry?\nApplejack: Don't both those fruits mean purple?\nRarity: Yes, but one's a lovely purple and one's... well, icky.\nRainbow Dash: [groans] Just put the gem in! We're trying to set a record here!\n[clunking]\nPinkie Pie: [cheer-singing] Yay! We solved another clue, 'cause our friendship is so true! Yaaaay, us!

Uh, why in Equestria would something like that be in here? Ha.\nTrixie: Well, I cast a pretty amazing spell that transported it to the last place I was thinking of, but I might have been thinking about how I'd treat myself to a nice brooch instead.\n\"Clarity Cut\": Ah, well, no huge table here. Uh, are you still interested in that brooch?\nTrixie: Sure!\nStarlight Glimmer: No! We don't have time for this! Twilight and the girls are gonna be back soon!\n[magic warbling]\nStarlight Glimmer: But I'm not upset. What's our next stop?\n\nGranny Smith: Nope, I ain't seen it.\nStarlight Glimmer: Are you sure? It's really, really important that we find it. And it might be here because somepony...\n[magic warbling]\nStarlight Glimmer: ...was craving apples.\nTrixie: I'm still craving them. They'd go so well with cinnamon nuts!\nGranny Smith: [sniffs] Oh, them nuts sure do smell good! Heh-heh.\nStarlight Glimmer: Granny Smith, please. The table?\nGranny Smith: [confused muttering] Well, my eyes ain't what they used to be, but I'd know for sure if a big ol' table done appeared out of thin air.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs]\n\n[teapot poodle yapping]\nTrixie: Darn. I could've sworn it'd be at the ice cream parlor, because it was warm in the castle and I thought I wanted ice cream, and\u2014 Ooh! Maybe we should check out the Crystal Empire, 'cause Twilight's castle is made out of crystals, so I totally had crystals on my mind.\n[magic warbling]\nStarlight Glimmer: [tired] Okay, we better start moving if we want to make it to the Crystal Empire.\nTrixie: Are you okay, Starlight? Because you seem a little, uh, what's the word... \"lch-bh-ba\".\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans]\n[magic warbling]\nStarlight Glimmer: [tired] Nope.

I had no idea you felt that way.\nStarlight Glimmer: Yeah! I do! [sighs] But to be fair, I don't know how you could have known. I did a spell and bottled up my anger, but when the bottle broke, it infected these three. I'm really sorry. I used magic so I wouldn't use magic.

Wait, did I say that already?\n[thump]\nSpike: Uh-huh.\nShining Armor: Oops.\nPrincess Cadance: Oh, and this is the most important thing of all \u2013 her Whammy.\nSpike: I take it Flurry named it?\nPrincess Cadance: Yup. If she gets fussy, just give her the Whammy and she'll calm right down.\nShining Armor: You getting all this, Twily?\nTwilight Sparkle: Whammy. Got it. Where are you guys headed, anyway?\nShining Armor: You remember my friend from the royal guard, Spearhead?\n[beat]\nSpike: Honestly, all of your friends' names are very similar.\nShining Armor: Well, he has a pop-up art show at the Ponyville Cafe, and we decided to go at the last minute.\nPrincess Cadance: We're not exactly art enthusiasts, but we could really use a night out.\nSpike: You mean \"day\"?\nPrincess Cadance: That's what I said! Isn't that what I said?\nSpike: Mmm... Mm-mm.\nPrincess Cadance: Either way, are you sure you can watch her?\nSpike: Uh-uh-uh!\nTwilight Sparkle: Mmmmh...\nFlurry Heart: [squeaks]\nTwilight Sparkle: Have no fear! The best aunt ever has everything under control!\nPrincess Cadance and Shining Armor: [kissing]\nShining Armor: Thanks again, Twily.\nSpike: Okay, let's grab that Whummy thing and go.\n[magic zap]\nFlurry Heart: Uh-uh! [growls like a bear]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, you want to pretend we're the bears. I suppose we have time for a quick game.\nSpike: Do we, though?\nFlurry Heart: [giggling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey! All right! [growls like a bear] I'm gonna get ya!\n[toy squeaking]\nSpike: Ugh! [sighs] You should catch her soon, 'cause we've got lots to do! Horsey-hives-covered foals counting on us, remember?\nTwilight Sparkle: Got it! [growls like a bear] I'm catching up!\nFlurry Heart: [happy squeals]\nTwilight Sparkle: [growls like a bear]\nFlurry Heart: Huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: [roars like a bear]\nFlurry Heart: [squeaks]\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh-oh. Sorry, bug. Did that scare you? It's okay. It's just Auntie Twily!\nFlurry Heart: [blows raspberry] Bleh!\nTwilight Sparkle: You know, that was a very advanced spell for somepony your age. Looks like you're already taking after your Auntie Twily.\nSpike: All right, that was pretty adorable. But now...\nTwilight Sparkle: I know, Spike, we're leaving.\nFlurry Heart: [stomach grumbles]\nTwilight Sparkle: I just have to feed her real quick.\nFlurry Heart: [blows raspberry]\n[splat]\n\nShining Armor: Is this art or... a mistake?\nPrincess Cadance: I have no idea. But who cares? We're not changing diapers.\nSpearhead: Shining Armor! Cadance! How are the new 'rents? Gimme some hoof. Oh, it is so [grunt] good [grunt] to see you dudes! Hey, thanks for coming.\nShining Armor: Of course! We're having a great time! Loving all the... art!\nSpearhead: Uh, that's a trash can.\nShining Armor: So it is! I knew that!\nSpearhead: But hey, who's to say it's not art? Art can be anything that speaks to you. It changed my world. This is my latest piece \u2013 \"A Thousand Nights in a Hallway\".\nPrincess Cadance: Wow, I guess nighttime in a hallway can be pretty dark.\nSpearhead: [seriously] There is none more dark.\nShining Armor: [baffled] Yeah. Totally.\nPrincess Cadance: We're just so happy to be here. Usually we're covered in mashed peas by now.\n\nSpike: When they said mashed peas were her favorite...\n[splat]\nFlurry Heart: [giggles]\nSpike: ...did they mean her favorite thing to decorate a room with?!\nFlurry Heart: [giggles]\n[splat]\nTwilight Sparkle: Aw, come on, Spike. That wasn't too bad.\nSpike: Yeah, and we're only twenty minutes behind schedule.\nTwilight Sparkle: Twenty minutes?! [exhales] It's fine. We can totally do this.\n[splat]\nTwilight Sparkle: [embarrassed giggle]\n\n[doors open]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, we just need to grab some toys and we are outta here.\n[shopping cart squeaking]\nFlurry Heart: [roars like a bear]\nTwilight Sparkle: You want to play, don't you? Well, I know a game that's even more fun! [aside to Spike] And more efficient. [to Flurry Heart] Playing race carts! Ha-ha!\nFlurry Heart: [giggling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Woo-hoo!\n[tires squealing]\nSpike: [panting] [out of breath] Hey, nice thinking, Twilight!\nTwilight Sparkle: Best aunt ever! Hang on, Flurry. The race cart's taking a pit stop.\nFlurry Heart: [giggles]\n[cart rattling]\nFlurry Heart: [giggling]\n[thud]\nSpike: I'm not a detective, but I think we got a suspect.\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh?! [sighs] Well, we'd better get to cleaning. We've got no time to waste!\nSalespony: Thanks, but they were organized by color.\nTwilight Sparkle: [snorts, sighs]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [panting]\n[tires squealing]\nTwilight Sparkle: [panting] Yes! We gained back a whole five minutes from running here!\nSpike: Yeah, but if you add that to the forty minutes we were already behind... we're still... fifty five minutes behind!\n[beat]\nSpike: I mean... [nervous chuckle] Yay, team?\nTwilight Sparkle: Mm-hmm!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks for helping us out, Cheerilee. Sorry we were late.\nCheerilee: Oh, no problem. But I gotta say, I'm surprised you came to me for a book. Don't you have a huge collection?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, but\u2014\nFlurry Heart: [giggling]\n[stroller springs squeaking]\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry, one second.\nFlurry Heart: [annoyed grunt] [giggling]\nTwilight Sparkle: I didn't think the foals would be interested in The Unabridged History of Amulets in pony Latin.\nCheerilee: Yeah, it was good you came to me. How about the complete collection of Ponyville Fables and Stables?\nTwilight Sparkle: Mmm, too long.\nCheerilee: Alien Alicorns vs. Space Pirates?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, the science there is preposterous\u2014\nSpike: How about Burnferno, Warrior from Within? It's about a handsome dragon warrior who slays evildoers with his breath and his snappy comebacks!\nTwilight Sparkle: [giggles] Let's borrow that for you and keep looking.\nSpike: Eh.\nTwilight Sparkle: What else?\n[Whammy squeaks]\nFlurry Heart: [giggles]\n[magic zap]\nCheerilee: Uh, how about Gusty the Great?\nTwilight Sparkle: Ooh, that was one of my favorites when I was a filly! We'll take it!\nCheerilee: [teeth chattering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Mm, should I go with something more current...? [gasps]\nFlurry Heart: Ta-da!\nTwilight Sparkle: Cheerilee, I am so, so sorry! I didn't even hear her leave!\n[erasing noises]\nFlurry Heart: [worried noise]\nTwilight Sparkle: There, all clean.\nCheerilee: Great. Now I'll just write it up again...! [slightly muffled] With my mouth.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ehh...\n\nSpearhead: Feast your eyes. This one's called \"A Kitchen Guard's Journey\"!\nPrincess Cadance: [unsure] Oh...\nShining Armor: This reminds me of the time Flurry got into the chocolate pudding, and we found little chocolate hoofprints all over the carpet.\nPrincess Cadance: That took forever to clean up! But remember how cute her little face looked when we caught her?\nShining Armor: Yeah. She was like, [imitating Flurry Heart] \"Uh-oh!\"\nPrincess Cadance and Shining Armor: [laughing]\nSpearhead: Whoa, art is so evocative! I wasn't even going for that memory! Score!\n\n[stroller squeaking]\nSpike: Honestly, Twilight, I don't even want to tell you how late we are. Should I just cancel our visit to the hospital?\nTwilight Sparkle: What?! Cancel?! We can't cancel, Spike! The sick foals are counting on us! And the B.A.E. would never throw in the towel like that!\nSpike: B.A.E.?\nTwilight Sparkle: \"Best Aunt Ever\"? Besides, this errand is gonna be different.\nSpike: How do you figure that?\nTwilight Sparkle: Because Flurry can play with the Cake twins and stay out of trouble! Best aunt ever!\n\nPound Cake: [giggling] [suddenly shuts up]\nCake Twins and Flurry Heart: [baby noises]\nTwilight Sparkle: Wonderful! They're friends already!\n[toy squeaks]\nSpike: Huh. I shouldn't have doubted you.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks! Wait, you doubted me?\nSpike: [nervous squeak]\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, you watch Flurry. I'll take care of everything else. [quickly, to Pinkie Pie] Hi, Pinkie! How's it going? I need to pick up the cupcakes for the foals at the hospital! And can you do apology treats?\nPinkie Pie: I'm good. Here they are. Of course I can!\nTwilight Sparkle: Do you still have a giant file on everypony's favorite treat?\nPinkie Pie: In my secret party planning cave!\n[ding!]\nPinkie Pie: BRB!\n[papers rustling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hee-hee! Remind me to tell you later how amazing you are. Cheerilee?\nPinkie Pie: Eh. I am pretty awesome.\n[paper rustling]\nPinkie Pie: Cherry oatmeal cookies with yellow sprinkles.\nTwilight Sparkle: Great! Can you write \"sorry\" on them?\nPinkie Pie: I've got a stamp for that!\n[stamp]\nCake Twins: [arguing baby noises]\nSpike: Hey, you guys! No need to fight! Uh... Hang on! I'm sure there's another one! Ugh, no, not this one... Oh, that's cute...\n[toys thudding and squeaking]\nCake Twins: [screaming]\n[thud]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hold on, sweetie. We'll play in a second.\n[snap]\n[magic noises]\nTwilight Sparkle: The salespony at the toy store...\nPinkie Pie: Apple strudel cupcake with caramel drizzle!\nCake Twins: [grunts]\nFlurry Heart: [yelps]\n[splat]\nCake Twins: [grunts]\n[splat]\nPinkie Pie: [noise of alarm]\n[paper ripping]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, no. You're making the same face Cheerilee made. Pinkie, remind me what your favorite treat is.\nPinkie Pie: Mmm... The sampler platter.\nTwilight Sparkle: We'll take three of those.\nSpike: Aha! Told you I'd find another one. [gasps]\n[balloon pops]\nSpike: [chuckles nervously]\n[splat]\n\nSpike: Uh... Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Out of the question! We are not cancelling! It's going to be okay! It has to be okay! It's been so terrible so far it can't possibly end up\u2014 Oh...\n[squirt]\nSpike: Uh, sorry.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] No, I needed it.\nSpike: I was just gonna say, we're here.\n[tires screeching]\nSpike: And we're only four-and-a-half minutes late!\nTwilight Sparkle: Four and a half?!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [reading] \"...and while nopony had ever tried to reach Cloudsdale on hoof, Gusty the Great was not deterred! She and her unicorn warriors marched up the hill. But suddenly, they encountered...\"\nSpike: [gasps] What?! What was it?!\nTwilight Sparkle: \"It was the treacherous Grogar...\"\nFlurry Heart: [baby noises underneath]\nTwilight Sparkle: \"...and Gusty could tell he was ready for battle. Gusty called out to the unicorn warriors\u2014\" Ow! Not right now, Flurry.

You're floating!\nSpike: So are you!\n[magic zaps]\nFlurry Heart: [worried noises]\nTwilight Sparkle: Flurry, honey, you need to stop this. Put us down, please.\nSpike: Twilight, look out!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\n\nTwilight Sparkle and Spike: [screaming]\n[thud, thud]\nTwilight Sparkle: Nopony panic! Everything's gonna be okay!\n[magic zap]\n[thud]\n[magic zap]\n[thud]\n[magic zaps]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, I can't keep up with her!\nSpike: Oh, yeah, where's her Snoozle?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Her what?!\nSpike: You know, her Whacky Whompy thing? The snail? Where is it? Cadance said it calms her down.\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't see it!\nFoals: [worried noises]\n[magic noises]\nTwilight Sparkle: Flurry Heart! Put us all down this instant!\nFlurry Heart: [worried noise]\nFoals and Nurse Redheart: [yelps]\nTwilight Sparkle: Is everypony okay?\nFoals: [noises of assent]\n[thud]\nTwilight Sparkle: Flurry, that was very, very bad! You could have hurt somepony!\nFlurry Heart: [starts crying]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Flurry, I didn't mean to\u2014\nFlurry Heart: [continues crying]\nTwilight Sparkle: Sweetie, you don't have to be scared. It's just me, see?\nFlurry Heart: [confused crying noise]\nTwilight Sparkle: You're scared of me. Because I yelled at you like a big scary bear. Flurry, I'm so sorry. I've been a terrible aunt today. All you wanted to do was play, and I've barely been able to pay attention to you. None of this is your fault. It's mine. So much for being the best aunt ever. But I hope you know how much I love you.\nFlurry Heart: [giggles]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, I take it you forgive me?\nFlurry Heart: [honk]\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks, Flurry. How about we head home? After we find your Whammy, of course.\nNurse Redheart: [clears throat, taps hoof]\nTwilight Sparkle: And clean up. [embarrassed giggle]\n\nPrincess Cadance: [tearing up] This one kind of reminds me of Flurry's hair.\nShining Armor: [tearing up] Uh-huh. And this one reminds me of Flurry too.\nSpearhead: How so?\nShining Armor: It's small... like her! I-I can't do this anymore! Spearhead, this has been great, but\u2014\nSpearhead: Say no more. My art has always spoken to me about what I love. But knowing that it spoke to you about what you love speaks to me.\nShining Armor: What...?\nSpearhead: Go to her.\n\nTwilight Sparkle and Flurry Heart: [giggling]\n[magic zap]\nFlurry Heart: [muffled giggling] [unmuffled giggling]\nTwilight Sparkle and Flurry Heart: [giggling]\n[door opens]\nShining Armor: Flurry?! Where's our little foal?! Ah! Oh, we missed you so much!\nPrincess Cadance and Shining Armor: [loving chuckles]\nFlurry Heart: [encouraging noises]\nPrincess Cadance and Shining Armor: [sighs]\nPrincess Cadance: But it looks like you had a great time without us.\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, not so much. Flurry got into some mischief, but it wasn't her fault. I shouldn't have agreed to watch her with such a jam-packed schedule. It was too much to juggle. But Flurry taught me an important lesson today. It turns out being the best aunt ever isn't about spending the most time with your niece, but spending quality time with her. And she taught me a really cool bear game, so I guess I learned two things.\nPrincess Cadance and Shining Armor: [laughing]\nShining Armor: Well, we definitely should've given you more of a heads up.\nPrincess Cadance: Yes! From now on, we'll give you plenty of notice.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ohh, that would be great.\nPrincess Cadance: Hey, what are you doing next Tuesday?\nTwilight Sparkle: [surprised snort]\nPrincess Cadance: For dinner, not to babysit.\nTwilight Sparkle: [chuckle] I'll have to check with Spike, but I think we're free.\nPrincess Cadance: Where is Spike, anyway?\n\nSpike: [reading] \"The dashing dragon warrior breathed a scorching flame from his snout, then chuckled to himself as he flew into the sunset.

I'm proud of each and every one of you. Uh... each of... No, just you, actually.\nPinkie Pie: Go, Maud! Woo-hoo! Number one! Number one!\nRusty Tenure: Fillies and gentlecolts... and is that magnesium-rich basalt? It is my honor to present our vale-rock-torian, Maud Pie. Excuse me. Doctor Pie.\nPinkie Pie: Whoo!

Encore!\n[clank]\n\n[theme song]\n\nPinkie Pie: [long high-pitched squeal, rapidly] You're moving to Ponyville! We'll live together and get bunk beds and I'll make us fuzzy slippers that say \"Best Sister Friends Forever\", although I probably can't fit all those words on a slipper, so maybe just \"BSFF\", but we don't have to decide right now because we'll be together all the time since when it comes to Ponyville, the doctor is in!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Slow down, Pinkie Pie.\nPinkie Pie: Yooooouuuuu'rrrrrrrreeeeeeee mmmmmmmmmmooooooooovvvvvvvviiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnggggggg tttttttooooooo Pooooooooooonnnnnnnnyyyyyyyyvvvvvvviiiiiiilllllllleeeeeeeee....\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I'm not definitely moving to Ponyville.\nPinkie Pie: Of course you are, silly. You said... [imitating Maud] \"There's nothing left to study back home on the rock farm, so I might move to Ponyville.\" [inflates, pop]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I'm also considering Ghastly Gorge.\nPinkie Pie: [laughs] Classic Maud sense of humor! You should do stand-up!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I do. But that wasn't a joke.\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] Ghastly Gorge? That terrible, awful, no-fun, all-alone canyon in the middle of nowhere?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] There or Ponyville.\nPinkie Pie: But Ponyville is so \"eee-hee-hee-hee-hee!\" and Ghastly Gorge is so \"Blegh!\"\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] It's a rock-based decision.\nPinkie Pie: But what about BSFFs?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] That's why I'm giving Ponyville a chance.\nPinkie Pie: Phew! So all I have to do is prove Ponyville has better rocks than Ghastly Gorge? Challenge accepted. We'll drop your stuff off at my place, and then hold onto your world, 'cause it's about... to... get... rocked!\n[beat]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Okay.\n\nPinkie Pie: Ghastly Gorge may have rocks, but our gem cave rocks!\n[harp glissando]\nPinkie Pie: Huh? Huh? Oh, and look! You'll never know who you'll see!\nRarity: [gasps] Maud, darling! It's lovely to see you again! Oh! Congratulations on your rocktorate. What are you doing now?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Talking to you.\nRarity: Oh, y\u2014 Right. [laughs, clears throat] Well, if your trained eye happens to see a chartreuse gem, I'm desperate to find one.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I found one.\nRarity: Oh, you're an absolute darling! This will surely make my gown stand out at Countess Coloratura's album release party. Do you know how rare this is?\nPinkie Pie: Just another day in Ponyville!\n[ding]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] That's actually a really common gem.\nPinkie Pie and Rarity: Huh?\n[rocks crumbling, gems falling out]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] These are all really common gems.\nPinkie Pie: They are? Uh, I mean, heh, come on! Of course they are! That's why I didn't bring you here to impress you! I wanted to make sure you had a chance to, heh, say \"hello\" to your old pal... Spike!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Hello, Spike.\nPinkie Pie: Way to go, Maud! Cross that off the to-do list! Y'know what I'm sayin'? Check! Now, let's get moving, 'cause I'm about to show you something that'll make you yell \"All right!\"\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] All right.\nPinkie Pie: See? Ha-ha!\n\nPinkie Pie: Ta-da! It's a castle... made of rocks! Whaaaat?! Did I just blow your mind? I think I just blew your mind.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] A lot of structures are made from rocks, Pinkie. They're a very stable building material.\nPinkie Pie: But this place grew out of nowhere after a magical key-build gem followed a rainbow and buried itself in the ground! I mean, have you ever seen rocks like this?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Yes.\nPinkie Pie: No, you haven't!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] We literally just saw hundreds of them in the gem cave.\nPinkie Pie: But... but... Oh, look at those rocks!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Those are sting-bush seed pods.\nPinkie Pie: So they are! But, uh... look at that rock! It's even got four smaller rocks around it like legs!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] That's a tortoise.\nPinkie Pie: Whose side are you on, Tank?! [panicked panting] Oh, wait a minute! What's that?! It's a rock shaped like Lyra Heartstrings! Total rock! [growling]\n[deflating]\nPinkie Pie: [sighs] I guess you won't be moving to Ponyville after all. Those rocks at Ghastly Gorge don't know how lucky they are to have you.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Actually, rocks aren't the only reason I'm considering Ponyville.\nPinkie Pie: You said it's a rock-based decision.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I'm obviously passionate about exotic rocks, but I've always studied them... alone. I could handle some less exciting rocks if it meant I'd have somepony to talk to besides Boulder.\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] Are you saying you want... a friend?!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I wouldn't mind one.\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] Maudileena Daisy Pie, this'll be easy! What're you looking for in a friend? Gimme six qualities assigning each one a numerical importance rating between one and seven, seven being essential and one being \"eh\". [burps]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] It isn't hard to meet somepony I like. It's finding somepony who gets me.\nPinkie Pie: I get you.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] You're my sister. It's different.\nPinkie Pie: Maud, you are the best! You never know when the lightning of friendship will strike. Somepony could come barreling through that door at this very moment and become your best friend!\n[suspenseful music]\nPinkie Pie: Y'know, I really thought somepony was gonna come barreling through that\u2014\n[door opens]\n[bump!]\nStarlight Glimmer: [grunts]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Uh.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, my fault! Totally my fault! Are you okay? I should've been watching where I was going, and\u2014 You look really familiar. Have we met before?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Yes.\nStarlight Glimmer: I knew it!\nPinkie Pie: Whaaaaat?!\nStarlight Glimmer: No, no, don't tell me. Um...\nPinkie Pie: [squeals]\nStarlight Glimmer: Yeah. See, I was really hoping you'd tell me while I pretended to remember.\nPinkie Pie: How is this possible? [screams]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I traveled Equestria for my rocktorate dissertation.\n\n[rock breaking]\nStarlight Glimmer: Psst! Do you know a lot about rocks?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Yes.\nStarlight Glimmer: Have you ever come across some kind of super-powerful stone that can store the cutie mark magic of... I don't know... an entire village?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Yep. In the big cave.\n\nPinkie Pie: [laughs] Hey, I got an idea. Let's not tell anypony that part where you maybe, for sure, accidentally helped Starlight enslave a town! [laughs, seriously] Tell nopony!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] It's not like she's enslaved anypony lately.\nStarlight Glimmer: [chuckling weakly, sighs] Well, great seeing you again. I gotta run a few errands. [sighs]\nPinkie Pie: [through the side of her mouth] Offer to help.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] What?\nPinkie Pie: Offer to help!\nStarlight Glimmer: You wanna help?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Do I?\nPinkie Pie: Of course you do! Go!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Okay.\nPinkie Pie: [squeals] They're totally gonna be best friends and then Maud will choose Ponyville, and we'll get to wear BSFF slippers!\n[thud]\n\n[Starlight's theme playing]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Rocks take on different properties when interacting with magic. With the right stone, you could rule all of Equestria if you wanted to.\nStarlight Glimmer: You're messing with me.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Am I?\n[grim music]\nStarlight Glimmer: [laughs, sighs] So other than rocks, what else are you into?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Minerals. Plate tectonics. Oh, and stand-up comedy, of course.\nStarlight Glimmer: I like... kites.\n[beat]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Kites are cool.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: The trick with an S.L.K. is not to make the spars too heavy. But if they're too light, you've got no ballast and then good luck tacking against the A.O.I.! [beat] I really like kites.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] They're starting to grow on me.\nPinkie Pie: Pizza delivery! Oh! Maud and Starlight? You're here too? Whoa-ho-ho! What a coincidence! 'Cause I was just, y'know, delivering this pizza to, um... you!\n[thwack]\nPinkie Pie: So how's it going?\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, just hanging out\u2014\nPinkie Pie: Hey! You could use this time to bond and talk about feelings! For example, do you feel like you're becoming friends?\nStarlight Glimmer: Um... I feel... like I don't want to talk about feelings?\nPinkie Pie: Great! I'll go next. I feel like I love that you two are becoming best friends! I mean, your friendship could be the friendship that makes Maud move to Ponyville! No pressure, Starlight. Um, hello? Where'd you two go?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Sorry about my sister. There's no half-excited with her.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, I know. But she always calms down. Eventually.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Why do you find rocks so fascinating?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Each one has a different story to tell. Like Boulder here. This tells me he's over two thousand years old. [to Boulder] You don't look a day over six hundred.\nStarlight Glimmer: Wow. You can tell that from a line?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I didn't get a rocktorate because I can shred on guitar like nopony else.\nStarlight Glimmer: [laughs]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Another reason I like rocks \u2013 they don't exclude you if you're... different than other ponies.\nStarlight Glimmer: They're beautiful and strong, but they don't judge you or make you feel less than in any way. I think I'm starting to like rocks, too.\n[tapping]\nStarlight Glimmer: It's hollow?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] It's granite. Hollow granite is highly unusual.\n[crashing and crumbling]\n[whimsical music]\nStarlight Glimmer: Wow! Have you ever seen anything like this?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] No. And that's unusual. For me.\nPinkie Pie: There you are! I thought you went your separate ways but you can't imagine how happy I am to find you both together and to witness one of your firsts as friends!\n[camera flashes]\nPinkie Pie: First time discovering an underground cavern! [squeals] I can't wait 'til you're old and eating pistachios together and telling your grand-foals about this! Oh, no! They're not bonding!\n[ding]\nPinkie Pie: I got an idea!\n[ripping]\nPinkie Pie: [exaggerated] Whooaa! I'm tripping on a rock at this very moment! And now I'm falling down!\n[click, boom]\nPinkie Pie: [exaggerated] Oh, no! My accidental clumsiness has trapped us here! Where you'll be forced to bond until we're rescued.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, we won't have to wait for that. There's gotta be a spell that\u2014\nMaud Pie: [deadpan, to Boulder] Get us out of here, boy.\n[crashing and crumbling]\nStarlight Glimmer: Boulder, that was awesome!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] No. That was sandstone.\nStarlight Glimmer: More sand than stone, apparently.\nPinkie Pie: I'm thinking you wear these around your neck at all times so I don't lose you again, you sillies! That way, I can track your progress as friends!\n[cowbells donging]\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! And tomorrow, we can have a friendship brunch! What's your favorite kind of omelette cupcake?! [hushed] Mine's jalape\u00f1o red velvet!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan groan]\nStarlight Glimmer: Yeah, um, I-I don't know if I can make it.\nPinkie Pie: You'll change your minds when you smell the yummy food! Come on!\n[cowbells donging]\n[snap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Oops.\n\nPinkie Pie: Tomorrow's brunch is going to be the scrumptiest, brunchiest, munchiest brunch ever!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Yeah. About that...\nPinkie Pie: The problem is, while you two were alone, I couldn't get data points on your friendship probabilities! Were you making Starlight smile? How was Starlight's smile-to-frown ratio? Anything over five-to-one is great! Oh, and how many times did you smile like this? [squees]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Zero times.\nPinkie Pie: Oh, Maud, don't be so hard on yourself! You've got the best friendship-maker in Ponyville on the case! I'll be by your side the whole time! Speaking of which, your bell fell off, silly!\n[cowbell donging]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Pinkie Pie, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but\u2014\nPinkie Pie: Buuuuuut?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] [sighs] Never mind.\nPinkie Pie: Don't worry, Maud. When you see this brunch, you'll realize everything's gonna be okay! And then, I have amazing bonding activities planned for the next seventeen days! You and Starlight will be besties in no time! Goodnight! [kisses] [clap, clap] [snoring] ...Cupcake omelette...\n\n[birds tweeting]\nPinkie Pie: Friendship brunch!\n[paper rustling]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] [voiceover] Pinkie Pie. Thank you for trying so hard to help me make friends. But my decision has to be rock based. And Ghastly Gorge has such great rocks, I won't even have time for friends. It's better this way. Sorry it didn't work out. Maud.\nPinkie Pie: Maud! Wait!\n[train chuffing]\nPinkie Pie: Maud! [tearing up] Maud...\n\nStarlight Glimmer: [snoring softly]\nPinkie Pie: Starlight, wake up!\nStarlight Glimmer: [yelps] Kites!\n[thud]\nStarlight Glimmer: Huh? Oh. If this is about brunch, I-I, uh... You know what? Jalape\u00f1o red velvet omelettes sound gross. I-I just can't.\nPinkie Pie: Maud left in the middle of the night!\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh. I guess Ghastly Gorge really does have the best rocks.\nPinkie Pie: [sniffs] Why couldn't you two just be friends?\nStarlight Glimmer: Pinkie Pie, I like Maud.\nPinkie Pie: You do?\nStarlight Glimmer: Yeah. She's weird!\nPinkie Pie: Hey!\nStarlight Glimmer: No, in a good way! She sees the world in a totally different way than anypony I've ever met. She accepts me for who I am. She taught me that a rock is never just a rock, and she could make anything funny. We never had to say it, but we got each other.\nPinkie Pie: You really were becoming friends?\nStarlight Glimmer: I think so, but you kinda sorta... got in the way.\nPinkie Pie: [deep gasp]\nStarlight Glimmer: [gasps] You're right, too harsh. Let's go with... You ruined everything all the time?\nPinkie Pie: [whimper]\nStarlight Glimmer: Mmmmh, that's worse. What I'm trying to say is\u2014\nPinkie Pie: [tearing up] I have to go!\nStarlight Glimmer: Ta-da... Friendship lesson... learned?

I found emerald jasper.\n[snap]\nPinkie Pie: [shrieks]\n[jacking noise]\nPinkie Pie: Are you okay, Maud?! That eel almost ate you!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] What eel?\n[snap]\nPinkie Pie: [yelps]\n[quarray eel roaring]\nPinkie Pie: [panting]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] You didn't need to come. I'm having a great time on my own.\n[snap]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I even made a new friend.\nPinkie Pie: Is it a rock?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Yes.\n[snap]\nPinkie Pie: [shrieks] Maud!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I don't belong in Ponyville. It only proved I'm better off all by myself. Like I always have been.\nPinkie Pie: Don't say that! It was all my fault! I\u2014 [shrieks] I thought I knew everything about making friends, but I didn't even know my own sister! I forced you to do things my way, but my way isn't your way!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] This way.\nPinkie Pie: Exactly!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] No. This way.\n\nPinkie Pie: Maud, I thought you couldn't make a friend without my help, but it turns out you couldn't make a friend with my help. I underestimated you, and I'm sorry.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I know you did it out of love. You're my best sister friend forever.\nPinkie Pie: [bawling] Oh, Maud! I love you bigger than all Equestria! [sobbing]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] And you melt my heart more easily than sodium-rich plagioclase feldspar.\nPinkie Pie: [sniffs] I don't know what that means, but please please please please please give Ponyville another chance! But more importantly, give me another chance... to leave you alone.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] What do you think, Boulder?\n\nStarlight Glimmer: You're back!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Mm-hmm.\nStarlight Glimmer: For good?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Mm-hmm. This doesn't mean we need to start talking about feelings, does it?\nStarlight Glimmer: Heh. No way.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Maybe after this we could decorate my new place.\nStarlight Glimmer: Totally! Where is it?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Well, it's not in Ponyville. More like Ponyville-adjacent.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: It's perfect.\nPinkie Pie: Yes! My sister's totally staying in Ponyville! I mean Ponyville-adjacent! [laughs]\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: Sorry, sorry, I'm leaving! I promise. I'm not even here. Aah, you're wearing the slippers! Okay, now I'm really leaving.

You just rest here, and I'll have you all fixed up in no time. Oh, dear. I'm all out of bunny foot braces. I think we need to pay a visit to Dr. Fauna.\nAngel: [whimpering]\n\nFluttershy: [straining] Oh, I was sure she would be here today.\nAngel: [whimpering]\nFluttershy: Hello? [knocks on door] Is anypony there?\nDr. Fauna: [muffled] Fluttershy? Oh, am I glad to see you!\nFluttershy: [straining] I wish I could say the same, but the door's stuck, so I, um... can't see you.\n[animals chattering]\nDr. Fauna: Ohhhh. Somebunny hurt his foot. Let's bandage that up so he can get back home. I'd like to keep him overnight, but as you can see, my place is just bursting with animals! [exhale] I don't think I can take in even one more critter right now!\nClementine: [sneezes]\nFluttershy and Dr. Fauna: Oh, dear.\n\n[theme song]\n\n[animals chattering]\nFluttershy: [gasps] You really have your hooves full here.\nDr. Fauna: [sighs] This place is like a zoo! Then again, it's normally like that, but still... I can't keep up!\n[birds chirping]\nDr. Fauna: Oh. Now, does my favowite wittle bunny want a carrot pop?\nAngel: [blows raspberry]\nDr. Fauna: [sighs] That's okay. I think the goats ate all of them anyway.\n[goat belches]\nFluttershy: I just can't believe all these poor little animals are hurt. What happened?\nDr. Fauna: I'm flummoxed! Every day, there's more and more animals on my doorstep. Most of them just have minor ailments \u2013 hurt wings, stuffy noses, and such. But the trouble is even after they're all healed up, I can't seem to get these comfy critters to leave!\nFluttershy: Oh, dear.\n[nail clippers clipping]\nFluttershy: They do seem to have made themselves right at home here.\nDr. Fauna: I wonder why they chose to flock to my office. It just doesn't make sense.\nFluttershy: Don't be silly, Dr. Fauna. You're the best vet pony in Equestria. At least that's what I've been telling everypony.\nDr. Fauna: Uh... you did what?\nFluttershy: Oh, no. Do you suppose it's my fault? I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen. I just know animals feel safe and happy under your care.\n[ducklings chirping]\nDr. Fauna: Normally, I don't mind if a snake wants to slither in or a raccoon needs a rest, but now this place is so full, I have no space to treat any injured animals.\nFluttershy: That is a big problem... that I'm going to fix for you! I already have the perfect solution that'll make the critters happy and give you more space. Then you'll have all your ducks in a row!\nDr. Fauna: The sooner you fix it, the better!\nFluttershy: I'm on it!\nDr. Fauna: [sighs]\n\nFluttershy: I want to thank you all for rushing right over when I called.\n[squirrel chittering]\nAngel: [angry chittering]\nFluttershy: Dr. Fauna needs my help with a serious problem.\nTwilight Sparkle: A friendship problem?\nFluttershy: No. Her vet clinic is a bit... maybe, um... overrun with adorable critters in dire need of a safe place to lay their heads, and... they don't have anywhere to go!\nRarity: Oh, that's just awful.\nFluttershy: I know!\nApplejack: Yeah. Dr. Fauna's always fixin' Winona up when she ain't feelin' too fine, so helpin' her out is A-okay by me.\nRainbow Dash: Hah! Yeah!\nRarity: You can count on us!\nPinkie Pie: [simultaneously] Okie-dokie-lokie!\nTwilight Sparkle: [simultaneously] Okay!\nFluttershy: Oh, that's great news! Because it means you'll all be helping me with something special, too. Something that's been a dream of mine for a long time.\nPinkie Pie: Oh, goody! Is your dream to make a bouncy castle shaped like a gigantic bundt cake?\nFluttershy: Um, no. Not exactly.\nPinkie Pie: Huh. Just me then.\nRainbow Dash: So? What is it, Fluttershy? Spill!\nFluttershy: My dream is to build a real animal sanctuary.\n[bird chirps]\nFluttershy: A beautiful habitat where every animal \u2013 whether sick or scared or even just lonely, feathered or furry, scaly or slimy \u2013 every critter would be welcome. My sanctuary can be the one place in Equestria they call home 'til they feel ready to take on the world.\n[animals cheering]\nHarry: [blows nose]\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow, Fluttershy! I've never heard you speak with such conviction.\nRarity: Oh! That was exquisite!\nRainbow Dash: Pretty awesome.\nFluttershy: Oh, thank you, everypony. You all taught me so much about building my confidence over the years. It's because of your friendship that I finally feel able to make my dream project a reality. But I can't build the sanctuary alone. Will you join me?\nAll except Fluttershy: [eager agreement]\nApplejack: I'm happy to offer my extra hooves to ya. Huh. But come to think of it, I actually know a filly who'd be more help than I would. She's a friend of mine from Winona's sheep-herdin' competitions \u2013 Wrangler! Heh. She's an expert in animal enclosures.\nFluttershy: How lovely!\nPinkie Pie: Ooh-ooh-ooh! I know somepony, too! Hard Hat is the best construction pony in Ponyville. He can build anything you could ever, ever, ever want!\nRarity: Hearing you all mention these experts, I am reminded that I too have the perfect pony to help capture the essence of your vision. To give it some style, some flair! [chuckles]\nFluttershy: Is it you, Rarity?\nRarity: [chuckles] No! No. Um, I was referring to the premiere interior designer of the Canterlot elite \u2013 Dandy Grandeur. He helped me when I was setting up my Canterlot boutique. I know that he'd be thrilled to work with you.\nFluttershy: Wow, everypony! Thank you! I can't wait to meet all of them and hear their ideas. We're right on track to building the most wonderful sanctuary in Equestria!\n\nRupert: [hissing]\nFluttershy: Thank you, Rupert. Ahem. It's wonderful that you all could join me to discuss the Ponyville sanctuary project. My friends have so many nice things to say about each of your talents. This is a big project, so I'm happy to have such experienced ponies working on it with me.\nDandy Grandeur: Rarity has impeccable taste in design and friends, so I can't wait to work with you, you know?\nFluttershy: I-I think so.\nWrangler: Yee-haw! I'm just lookin' forward to helpin' ya out, ma'am! And the animals.\nFluttershy: Of course.\nHard Hat: So, uh, Pinkie Pie said you drew up some blueprints?\nFluttershy: Um, not exactly. It's more of a dream board.\nHard Hat: Hmmm, that sure doesn't look like an animal hospital.\nFluttershy: Well, that's because it's not. It's a sanctuary. A place that is safe but not restrictive. Cozy but natural. A place where the animals can come and go as they please.\n[mouse squeaking]\nFluttershy: So, can you build it?\nWrangler, Hard Hat, and Dandy Grandeur: [chuckling nervously] Uhhh...\n\nFluttershy: I want the sanctuary to have an open floor plan. No walls. More like an enclosure that melts into the trees. With a gate in the back. That way, the animals can return to the forest right when they feel ready.\nPinkie Pie: Sneaky! I like it!\nHard Hat: You know, uh, I designed the Ponyville Hospital. I could do the exact same thing right here. I still have the blueprints. Though it'll take a while to clear all these trees.\nFluttershy: But I don't want to clear the trees. I want to use them.\nHard Hat: Are you sure? What you're talking about doesn't really seem like a cohesive structure. Or any structure I'm familiar with.\nFluttershy: Critters don't live the same way ponies do. I know this is unconventional, but that's because we're trying to do something that's never been done before. I really believe it'll work.\n[birds chirping]\nHard Hat: Hmm. All right then. I'll see what I can do.\nPinkie Pie: See, Fluttershy? Whatever you want.\nFluttershy: Good.\nHard Hat: [to Steam Roller and Jack Hammer] I know she thinks she knows what's best, but once she sees how much better it works with these plans, she'll thank us.\nSteam Roller and Jack Hammer: Uh-huh, yup.\n\nDandy Grandeur: Which one do you like for the window treatments?\nRarity: Ooooh! Loving the print on those!\nFluttershy: Um, not to be rude, but there must be some mistake. We have no need for curtains at the sanctuary.\nDandy Grandeur: And whyever not?\nFluttershy: Everything is gonna look natural in the animal habitats, not like it was made for ponies.\nDandy Grandeur: All those shades of brown and green? But... they're so... drab, you know? [chuckles]\nFluttershy: Drab? You're calling the colors of beautiful trees drab?\nDandy Grandeur: Exactly! The natural look is not in right now. This is better. Trust me.\nFluttershy: I appreciate your input, but I just know the animals would be happiest with dirt brown pillows and leaf green accents.\nDandy Grandeur: I'll... look into it.\nFluttershy: Thank you.\nRarity: When a client has a vision... [chuckles]\nDandy Grandeur: ...Sometimes they need me to steer them away from it. Especially if it's dirt brown.\n\nWrangler: And right there, we got your standard sheep-travelin' cage. Fits two critters, dependin' on size.\nFluttershy: Hmm.\nApplejack: Uh, what is it, sugarcube?\nFluttershy: I'm looking for something less like a cage and more like a nice hug. Maybe if we lose that part.\nWrangler: Uh... Well then, it wouldn't be a cage.\nFluttershy: Exactly! Ooh! This is the perfect base for a little nest. I'll take a bunch of these and anything else the animals can burrow into.\nWrangler: You sure you don't want somethin' more secure for the critters?\nApplejack: She does have a point there. You wouldn't want a bunny wanderin' into the wrong cave, would ya?\nFluttershy: No! No cages. I want to give the animals the freedom to come and go. It's the only way they'll feel comfortable.\nApplejack: Well, she's the boss.\n\n[construction noises]\nFluttershy: [gasps]\nHard Hat: Hey, whaddya think, Fluttershy? I told ya we'd be fast. Almost finished with the building already.\nDandy Grandeur: The color just pops, you know?\nWrangler: Quite roomy inside, really. And very safe.\nDandy Grandeur: Don't keep us waiting, Fluttershy. Do you love it, or do you love it?\nFluttershy: I... I... [angry] I don't love it! This is not going to work at all! A giraffe can't fit through this door! With these curtains blocking the light, how are the birds gonna sing in the sunshine? And this is the opposite of a nice hug! I know you all worked hard, but none of you did anything I asked for!\nHard Hat: [scoffs] That's not true. We used the trees just like you asked!\nDandy Grandeur: And that curtain fabric is organic! It's got natural fibers!\nWrangler: And I added pillows inside my cages. That should count as feelin' like a hug!\nFluttershy: I may not know much about construction or interior design or wrangling, but I am an expert at one thing: the care of animals! And what animals need is a sanctuary, not this!\nDandy Grandeur: Maybe your \"vision\" wasn't all that it was cracked up to be, you know?\nFluttershy: My vision isn't the problem here! I told you all exactly what I wanted, and none of you listened to me! So while I appreciate your efforts, I no longer require your services!\nDr. Fauna: Hello! Oh, the animals have been so excited for the sanctuary, they couldn't wait any longer! [laughs] Can we take a look inside?\nFluttershy: Oh, um, actually, it's, uh, not ready and...

This didn't go at all like I had imagined.\n\n[sweet music playing]\nFluttershy: Sleep tight, little one. It's going to be okay. I promise.\n[mice squeaking]\nFluttershy: Now, now, every mouse has gotta wait their turn.\n[mice squeaking]\nFluttershy: [sighs] I'm so sorry. I thought I'd have a beautiful sanctuary for you all to stay in by now. But I put my trust in the wrong ponies.\nDr. Fauna: It's okay, Fluttershy. I know you did your best, but we can make this work here. It'll be a bit, uh... tight. Heh. But with your help, we'll have these patients back on their paws in no time, even without a sanctuary.\nFluttershy: No!\n[bear groans]\nFluttershy: I won't give up! These animals need me! And I'm gonna solve this once and for all! If this little lady can crawl all the way here from Western Equestria, I can find a way to build her a safe place to rest!\n[animals cheering]\nDr. Fauna: [laughing]\nFluttershy: Oh! [joins in laughter] Oops. Everyone back to sleep now.\n\nFluttershy: Thanks for coming, everypony. As you know, building the sanctuary didn't go quite as planned.\nPinkie Pie: I know, right? Who would've guessed that Hard Hat wouldn't build whatever you want?\nRarity: I never would've invited Dandy to help if I thought he'd act in such a manner.\nApplejack: [sighs] And Wrangler sure made a fool outta me, too. I'm sorry, Fluttershy.\nFluttershy: It's okay. You were all just trying to help. But I know that letting all the experts go was the right call.\nTwilight Sparkle: So what are you gonna do now?\nFluttershy: Try again. I'm going to rebuild the sanctuary and do it my way this time.\nPinkie Pie: All right, Fluttershy!\nApplejack: [simultaneously] You show 'em, filly!\nRarity: [simultaneously] That's the spirit!\nRainbow Dash: How about putting an awesome flying course for the birds right there?\nPinkie Pie: And a carrot cake stand here?\nTwilight Sparkle: Ooh, a library cave?\nFluttershy: Everypony, stop! I appreciate you sharing your thoughts, but I need everypony to respect mine. Other ponies may be experts in their fields, but animals are my field of expertise. And if I say this is what I want, then this is what needs to happen! Oh, um, for the animals of course.\nPinkie Pie: Wow! We should call you \"Flutterbold\" now!\nRest of main cast: [laughing]\nFluttershy: To get things back on track, I called in a favor from an old friend. He'll be here any minute.\nTwilight Sparkle: I thought you said no more experts.\nFluttershy: This is one expert I know I can trust to put the animals first. Plus there's nopony better at building.\n[knock on door]\n[door opens]\nBig Daddy McColt: [laughs] I heard somepony needs construction help fer them critters!\nTwilight Sparkle: Big Daddy McColt! [to the others] We met each other back when the map called me and Fluttershy to the Smokey Mountains!\nFluttershy: And he certainly knows his stuff when it comes to buildings and caring for animals.\nBig Daddy McColt: Well, shucks. Let's not stand around talkin' about it. Let's build us a sanctuary!\n[everyone cheers]\n\n[building montage music from \"The Hooffields and McColts\" playing]\n\nFluttershy: Are you ready?\nDr. Fauna: Oh, I'm more excited than a beaver in a log pile!\nFluttershy: Okay, you can open your eyes! Welcome to Sweet Feather Sanctuary, a safe and cozy retreat for every creature!\nDr. Fauna: [gasps] Oh, Fluttershy! This is amazing!\nFluttershy: Now you should have plenty of room at the clinic. Because once you've treated them, they can recover here! With my help, of course. It's okay, Lola. We all move at our own pace. Sometimes, all we need to do is believe in our dreams. And when we finally reach our goal, we'll know that it was worth what it took to get there, because the view will be even better than you imagined!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nSassy Saddles: [panting] [muttering] Oh, I have to...

In fact, I got my cutie mark the day I found him and took him home. But now, it's like he wants nothing to do with me.\nScootaloo: Don't you worry. You've come to the right place! The Cutie Mark Crusaders are on the job!\nApple Bloom: Trust us. Before you know it, you and your puppy will be back to bein' besties!\nSweetie Belle: You have the CMC guarantee! No matter what it takes, we promise you'll have our full attention.\nRarity: [singsongy] Guess who's here to spend the whole day with her little sister?!\nSweetie Belle: [gasps] Rarity? [grunts]\nRarity: Mmmm!\nSweetie Belle: [laughs nervously]\n\nRarity: [to Zipporwhill] Oh! Heh-heh. So sorry, dear. You're tiny. I didn't even see you there! Tend to get carried away with my entrances! Ta-da! [laughs]\nSweetie Belle: Rarity, what are you doing here?\nRarity: I am here to spend the day with you! I'm so excited, I could practically faint! You don't happen to have a fainting couch in here, do you?\nSweetie Belle: No!\nRarity: Oh, pfft, of course not. It's a treehouse! That would be tr\u00e8s gauche!\nSweetie Belle: Right... Well, I sure am happy to see you, and spending the day with you does sound like a lot of fun, but... I'm kind of right in the middle of something important. I have responsibilities and...\nRarity: Oh.\nApple Bloom: Go on, Sweetie Belle. We've got this covered. How often do you get to spend time with your sister?\nScootaloo: Yeah! Go have fun.\nSweetie Belle: You sure you two can handle our client here?\nRarity: \"Client\"? Oh, that is so adorable!\nSweetie Belle: Uh, thanks? I think?\nRarity: [sniffs] Ooh! You have mints to offer your \"clients\". [giggles] How.. professional. [giggles]\nSweetie Belle: Are you sure you two got this?\nApple Bloom: We have it handled.\nRarity: Oh, my! Look at this wall of satisfied customers! [gasps] You girls really have come a long way.\nSweetie Belle: Well, all right then. [to the other Crusaders] But, lemme know if you need me or run into any trouble.\nRarity: Come on, come on! You'll never guess what I have planned! [squeals]\n\n[foals and Rarity giggling]\nRarity: Ooh! So fun!\nSweetie Belle: [indignantly] What?\nRarity: [giggles] It's just I know how much you love these puppet shows.\nSweetie Belle: I did.\nRarity: Oh, it's just like old times! You, me, greasy popcorn. It's like no time has passed at all.\nZipporwhill: [struggling] Come on... [grunts]\nRarity: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! It's your favorite part!\n[music and silly sound effects]\n[foals and Rarity giggling]\nRarity: Banana peels are so very, very slippery! [laughs] It's funny because it's true! [laughs]\nSweetie Belle: [laughs nervously, sighs]\nRarity: What's the matter, darling?\nSweetie Belle: I, um, guess I just prefer black box experimental theater.\nRarity: What?! Since when?\nSweetie Belle: [sighs] I dunno. It's no big deal. This is great.\n\n[bell dings]\nRarity: Okay. We're here! Ta-da! [laughs, clears throat] Aren't you excited to be back here again? Do I know my baby sister, or do I know my baby sister?\nSweetie Belle: Uh... Yeah... Where is \"here\" exactly?\nRarity: Oh, pfft! Stop being so silly! You know this is your favorite ice cream shop!\nSweetie Belle: Oh. Right. From when I was a little filly.\nRarity: And I convinced the original owner to come out of retirement to make you your all-time favorite dessert! [giggles, claps twice]\n[tray drops]\nSweetie Belle: Huh. I remember it being much bigger.\nRarity: Well, go ahead. I know you're dying to dig in.\nSweetie Belle: [slurps, gulps]\nRarity: Well?\nSweetie Belle: [laughs nervously, sighs] That was, uh... one tasty bite. Still a little hungry, though.\nRarity: [gasps] We can get another sundae! Chocolate with rainbow sprinkles, perhaps?\nSweetie Belle: I was thinking something more like a salad.\nRarity: A salad? When did you get so practical?\nSweetie Belle: Oh, um... I guess another scoop would be fine!\nRarity: [gasps] One more Filly Clown Surprise, please!\n[thump]\nSweetie Belle: [groans]\nRipley: [panting]\nZipporwhill: Hey, Ripley!\nScootaloo: Look at me! Over here!\n[squeaking]\nRipley: [yawns]\n\n[balloon squeaking]\nRarity: I know you must be bored, darling. This is a very long line for one of Twisty Pop's balloons.\nSweetie Belle: [groans]\nRarity: But just be patient. We'll get you your favorite balloon bouquet, and it'll all be worth it.\nZipporwhill: [baby noises] Who's a good puppy? Who's a good puppy?! You're the good puppy!\nRipley: [whines]\nZipporwhill: Now come on, puppy-wuppy! Get the bally-wally!\nScootaloo: Come on, Ripley! Like this!\nApple Bloom: Good Scootaloo! See?\nRipley: [barking]\nZipporwhill: [sighs] It's not working.\nScootaloo: Maybe if the ball tasted better?\nApple Bloom: I don't think that that's it, Scoot.\nSweetie Belle: Doesn't look like it's going so well. I'm just gonna do a quick check with the CMCs.\nRarity: Well, I guess duty calls, and-and you, you have that now...\nSweetie Belle: What?\nRarity: Oh nothing, nothing. Go on.\nScootaloo: Hey, Sweetie Belle. How's your day with Rarity going?\nSweetie Belle: Well, it's not exactly great...\nApple Bloom: What do you mean?\nSweetie Belle: I don't know. It's like Rarity doesn't even know me anymore.\nScootaloo: I wish we could say our day is going better.\nRipley: [barking]\nApple Bloom: But we can't.\nScootaloo: Seems like Zipporwhill's puppy doesn't want anything to do with her.\nSweetie Belle: Hmmm. I see what you mean... [gasps] You know, it's an awfully big puppy...\nRarity: Sweetie Belle, hurry! He's making it!\nSweetie Belle: Gotta go...\n[balloons squeaking]\nRarity: [gasps] I know just what to do with this!\n\n[fashion music]\nRarity: And pose!\n[camera clicks]\nRarity: And pose!\n[camera clicks]\nRarity: Love the camera!\n[camera clicks]\nRarity: Hate the camera.\n[camera clicks]\nRarity: Love it again!\n[camera clicks]\nRarity: Sweetie Belle, you did \"hate the camera\" for all these shots! [sighs] Let's do it again.\nSweetie Belle: No!\nRarity: [gasps]\nApple Bloom: Come on, Zipporwhill, you can do this!\n[squeaking]\nRipley: [sniffing]\nRarity: W-What do you mean, no?\nSweetie Belle: Rarity, this is hard for me to say, but... um...\nRarity: Sweetie Belle, what is it? You've been acting weird all day. You used to love doing these things with me.\nSweetie Belle: That's just it! I used to! That's not who I am anymore!\nZipporwhill: This isn't who I am! My cutie mark must be for something else, because my puppy just doesn't love me anymore! Hmph!\nRarity: But it is you! You love puppet shows and dressing up and taking silly photos and tiny little clown-shaped ice creams!\nSweetie Belle: Really?! If you still think I like doing this stuff, then maybe you don't know me at all!\nRarity: [whimpering]\n\nRarity: [sobbing] I can't believe Sweetie Belle talked to me like that. [indignant] And after everything I did to set up a whole day of doing her favorite things! I mean, accusing me of not knowing her?! I know her better than anypony! Um, thank you, Twisty, but the hard truth is, my sister is being unappreciative right now! And I'm going to go and give her a piece of my mind!\n[balloon deflating]\n\nSweetie Belle: Hey, Zipporwhill. What are you doing here? Where are Apple Bloom and Scootaloo?\nZipporwhill: They're with my puppy. He seems to like them better than me anyway.\nSweetie Belle: Now, I'm sure that's not true.\nZipporwhill: It is. He doesn't like doing anything with me anymore. [sighs] He didn't even want to play with this. And all puppies love these. [sniffs]\n[squeak]\nZipporwhill: [sniffing, crying]\nSweetie Belle: I think that might be your problem right there! Come on!\n[squeak]\n\nRipley: [yawns]\nScootaloo: [groans] Find Zipporwhill, Ripley!\nApple Bloom: Woof, woof! It's Zipporwhill! Woof?\nScootaloo: [sighs] It's hopeless.\nApple Bloom: Sweetie Belle!\nScootaloo: Zipporwhill! [sighs] We're sorry we haven't figured this out yet.\nSweetie Belle: Don't worry, girls. I think I cracked this one.\nRarity: Aha! There she is! [gasps] Oh, dear. Really should have changed. [huffs] No matter! I'm going to give her quite the talking to! ...Right after she's done with her conversation. Anger is no excuse for poor manners, after all.\nSweetie Belle: Okay, Zipporwhill. What do you see?\nZipporwhill: My puppy?\nSweetie Belle: That's not what I see. I see a full-grown dog.\nZipporwhill: He did get bigger, I guess.\nSweetie Belle: He's not just bigger. He's older, too.\nRipley: [grunts]\nSweetie Belle: You don't still play with the same toys from when you were a foal, do you?\nZipporwhill: Oh. Ohhh. The squeaker is a little small for him now. [sighs] It's just hard for me to believe he's not the same adorable little guy I found anymore.\nSweetie Belle: I understand. But doing things like you used to won't turn him back into a puppy.\nZipporwhill: So... what do I do?\nSweetie Belle: Treat him like the dog he is, and find new favorite things to do together.\nZipporwhill: You think so?\nRarity: I know so!\nSweetie Belle: Rarity?!\nRarity: Oh, Sweetie Belle. I heard what you said, and you are so right.\nScootaloo: About the dog?\nRarity: Yes, but about us, too. The truth is, I know you're not a little filly anymore. But it's just... the last time we did all of those things together, I... I didn't realize it was gonna be the last last time. I loved doing those things with you. It's hard for me to let that go.\nSweetie Belle: Aww, Rarity! I love being with you too! That will never change! But... maybe we could just try to do different things together?\n[clicking]\nRipley: [alerted dog noise] [panting]\nZipporwhill: What is it, puppy? [giggles] I mean, Ripley?\nRipley: [panting]\nZipporwhill: [giggling] I love you too, Ripley! Thank you, Crusaders.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: No problem!\nApple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Zipporwhill: [laughing]\nZipporwhill: Oh, Ripley!\nRarity: Sweetie Belle, I'm so very proud of the pony you've grown into.\nSweetie Belle: And I'm proud that no matter what, I'll always be your little sister.\nRarity: I, uh, have a little bit of time before I have to head back to Canterlot. Could we spend it together? What would a grown pony like you want to do?\nSweetie Belle: Well, I do have one idea...\n\nRarity and Sweetie Belle: [licking lips]\nRarity: Heh, I didn't realize your idea would be such a delicious one! [giggles] I don't know how I'm going to finish this.\nSweetie Belle: Oh! I'll help you!\nRarity: [giggles]\nSweetie Belle: [giggles]\n[camera clicks]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [straining]\nApple Bloom: [straining] Scootaloo... is this such a... good idea?\nScootaloo: What are you talking about? This is the best idea I've ever had!\nApple Bloom: [grunting] It's just...\nScootaloo: You wanna come. But we talked about this. Non-Pegasus ponies fall through the clouds.\nApple Bloom: Right, but...\nSweetie Belle: I think we're good.\n[rubber band straining]\nApple Bloom: We are? Scootaloo, I know you have to go to Cloudsdale to finish your report. I'm just wonderin' if this is the best way to get there.\nScootaloo: It'll be fine. Besides, how else could I get there?\nApple Bloom: A Pegasus chariot?\nSweetie Belle: A flock of birds?\nApple Bloom: A hot-air balloon?\nScootaloo: Huh. Those do seem a lot safer. Maybe I should try to find another waaaaaaaaayyyyyy!\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: [gasps]\nScootaloo: Woo-hoo!\n[poof]\nScootaloo: [grunts, weakly] Nailed it.\n[lawnmower humming]\nBow Hothoof: [echoing] Uh, little ma'am, are you all right?\n[head rattling]\nScootaloo: [gasps] You're...

Ow!\n[plates cracking]\nScootaloo: [stops screaming] I'm so sorry. I just... [squeals] I can't believe I'm meeting you! My name's Scootaloo, and I'm doing a school report on your daughter! [ding]\nBow Hothoof: Our Rainbow Dash?\nScootaloo: The report's on an inspirational pony in my life, and nopony inspires me more than she does! I'm putting together this scrapbook for my report! I'm her biggest fan!\nBow Hothoof: Now, little trotter, what you say is impossible. [excitedly] Because nopony is a bigger fan of our Rainbow Dash than us!\nScootaloo: Whoa! You always wear that shirt?\nBow Hothoof: Heh. Actually, it's, uh, laundry day. But pretty great, right?!\nScootaloo: Yeah!\nWindy Whistles: My name's Windy Whistles, and I just have to say that it is a total blast to meet somepony that loves Rainbow Dash as much as we do!\nBow Hothoof: What can we help you with?\nScootaloo: Well, I know all about Rainbow Dash's time in Ponyville, but I don't know anything about her life before that.\nBow Hothoof: Well, you came to the right place!\n[camera flashes]\nScootaloo: [gasps]\n\nWindy Whistles: Here you go! Rainbow Dash's favorite meal! A pasta and potato sandwich on sourdough! She just loved to carbo-load. [giggles]\nScootaloo: I can't believe I'm eating Rainbow Dash's favorite food made by Rainbow Dash's mom while sitting in Rainbow Dash's childhood kitchen! This is the greatest day of my life! [munches loudly] Mmmm!\nBow Hothoof: I think it's time for a tour of the house.\nScootaloo: [mouth full] Okay.\n\nBow Hothoof: Our little Dashie was an early learner and so rambunctious. The combination was\u2014\nWindy Whistles: [singsongy] Exciting!\n[camera flashes]\nScootaloo: Whoa... Is that... her room?\n[door opens]\nScootaloo: [screams] Rainbow Dash's linen closet! Her carpet! Her inspirational poster! [reading] \"When the going gets tough, the tough don't notice because they have hard shells.\" That's so Rainbow Dash!\n[camera flashing]\nScootaloo: Woo-hoo!\nBow Hothoof: Scootaloo, wanna see something really cool?\n[curtain opens]\n[door opens]\n[heavenly choir singing]\nScootaloo: [gasps]\n[door closes]\nBow Hothoof: I, uh, installed the sound effects myself.

She was wearing it when she spoke her first words.\nScootaloo: So cool!\n[camera flashes]\nWindy Whistles: And this broken lantern is from when she first learned to fly.\n[camera flashes]\nWindy Whistles: And this bitten apple is from when she grew her first tooth! [gasps] So many memories!\n[camera flashes]\nScootaloo: You're so lucky to have all of these!\nWindy Whistles: Well, I may have a ton of Dash-mentos, but I don't have any of those \"Rainbow Dash Saves Ponyville\" headlines like you.\nScootaloo: [gasps] Trade-sies?\nWindy Whistles: Deal-sies!\nScootaloo: So where's all the Wonderbolt stuff?\nBow Hothoof: You mean Rainbow Dash's personal collection of Wonderbolt memorabilia?\nScootaloo: No. I mean, where's all the stuff about Rainbow Dash getting accepted into the Wonderbolt Academy and then getting chosen as a Wonderbolt? Wait, you don't know that your daughter's a Wonderbolt? And I got to tell you?!\nBow Hothoof and Windy Whistles: Uhhhhhhhhh...\nScootaloo: Oh, wow! You should see your faces right now!\n[camera flashes]\nScootaloo: See? That's what your faces look like.\n\nBow Hothoof and Windy Whistles: Our daughter's a Wonderbolt?!\n[heavenly choir singing]\n[door closes]\nBow Hothoof: Great timing.\nScootaloo: Great door.\nWindy Whistles: I just... It's... Unbelievable!\nScootaloo: You two were kind enough to show me the Rainbow Dash you know. Now please, allow me to show you the Rainbow Dash I know.\n\n[Wonderbolts' theme playing]\nSpitfire: Let's make some thunder!\nRainbow Dash: I was born to make thunder!\n[thunder strikes]\nBow Hothoof: Our baby's a Wonderbolt!\nWindy Whistles: [cheering loudly]\nSpitfire: We've got turbulence!\nRainbow Dash: How? Where's it coming from?\nBow Hothoof: I'm so proud!\nMisty Fly: There!\nBow Hothoof and Windy Whistles: [cheering loudly] She's a Wonderbolt!\nRainbow Dash: Oh, no.\nSpitfire: Okay. Which pony broke protocol and invited guests to our training exercises?!\nRainbow Dash: I guess they're with me. [groans, embarrassed] Mom, Dad. So... good... to see you.\nWindy Whistles: Oh, honey, it's so great to see you, too! And wow! You were so amazing up there with all of that flying!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, how did you know I was here?\nWindy Whistles: Scootaloo filled us in on everything, you modest pony you!\n[camera flashes]\nScootaloo: I can't believe I'm documenting the moment your parents first saw you as a Wonderbolt!\nWindy Whistles: And these must be your Wonderbolt friends! Hello, team! I'm Windy Whistles, the mom of the best Wonderbolt ever! Yeah! Just kidding. You guys were great, too! Go, team!\nRainbow Dash: Moooom!\nScootaloo: [chuckles]\nSpitfire: Hello, ma'am. Nice to meet you.\nWindy Whistles: Nice to meet you as well, and love those goggles! Love 'em! You know, I have goggles, too. But they're mostly just for swimming. Oh, and bath time.\nRainbow Dash: Mom, please! They don't wanna hear about your bath time!\nBow Hothoof: I can't believe it! My daughter, a Wonderbolt! [sobs] So proud!\nRainbow Dash: Dad, hold it together. We're in public.\nBow Hothoof: I know! I know, i\u2014 but it's... just... You had a goal, and... you achieved it! [sobs]\n[camera flashes]\nSpitfire: All right, Wonderbolts! Let's hit the showers and give Rainbow Dash some time to spend with her family.\nRainbow Dash: Okay, yeah! Uh, great practice! I'll, uh, eh, catch up with you guys in a minute!\nFleetfoot: Sir, you really raised a great flyer!\nBow Hothoof: Oh, no! [straining] Tears... welling up again!\nRainbow Dash: Dad!\nBow Hothoof: [continues sobbing]\n[camera flashes]\nRainbow Dash: Could you give us a sec?\nScootaloo: Is something wrong?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah. You should've warned me that you were bringing my parents! Or talked to Twilight or something! Not just shown up!\nScootaloo: Why?\nRainbow Dash: Ugh! It's just my parents and I have a delicate relationship. I love them very much, and we're really close, but there's a reason I didn't tell them I'm a Wonderbolt! They can be a little bit... embarrassing.\nScootaloo: Huh? Really?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, really! And now you've invited a whole lot of crazy into my life!\nScootaloo: What's wrong with a little support?\n\nScootaloo: Bow and Windy, I'd like you to meet Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle.\nApple Bloom: Hi!\nSweetie Belle: Hello.\nBow Hothoof: Greetings, small ponies.\nApple Bloom: Are you excited to see Rainbow Dash?\nWindy Whistles: Oh, my, yes! And to think we never bothered to come to a Wonderbolt event!\nBow Hothoof: We said if Rainbow Dash isn't a Wonderbolt, then what's the point? But now, she is!\nScootaloo: And she earned it! Did you know it all started when she won a spot in the coveted Wonderbolts Academy, training under Spitfire?\nWindy Whistles: I didn't know that! How wonderful!\nScootaloo: But then, she had some heavy competition. Especially against another Pegasus named Lightning Dust.\nWindy Whistles: Oh, no!\nScootaloo: But, of course, Rainbow Dash proved to be the best and later made it into the Wonderbolt Reserves!\nWindy Whistles: Hooray again!\nScootaloo: But jealous ex-Wonderbolt Wind Rider was worried that Rainbow Dash might break his speed record. And so, he framed her for a crime she didn't commit.\nWindy Whistles: Oh, no!\nScootaloo: But thanks to Rarity, Rainbow Dash proved her innocence and became a backup Wonderbolt until Fire Streak retired, and she became an official Wonderbolt!\nWindy Whistles: Hooray! Wow, what a gripping tale!\nBow Hothoof: You really know your Rainbow Dash history. You're going to do great on your report.\nApple Bloom: Show's about to start.\n[Wonderbolts' theme playing]\nBow Hothoof and Windy Whistles: [hooting]\nBow Hothoof: Come on, Bolts! Let's start this thing!\nWindy Whistles: Wonderbolts' Big Showcase! Here! We! Gooooooooo!\nBow Hothoof: Rip it up and tear! It! Down!\nWindy Whistles: Then build it back up again and tear it back down again! Yeah!\nBow Hothoof: Woo! Yeah! Uh-huh, uh-huh! Go go go! Yes! Go, Rainbow Dash! Best Wonderbolt ever!\nWindy Whistles: Woo-hoo! That's my daughter! Go, Rainbow! Go, Dashie, go-go-go-go-go!\nBow Hothoof and Windy Whistles: [cheering loudly]\nWindy Whistles: You go, girl!\nFleetfoot: [to Rainbow] Your folks were definitely loud, but they weren't that bad.\n[fireworks]\nSpitfire: Whoa! Since when did we add fireworks to the show?!\nRainbow Dash: Uhhhh, we didn't.\n\n\n\n\nBow Hothoof:\nAttagirl!\nYeah!\nGo-go-go-go-go!\n\n\nWindy Whistles:\nWoo-hoo!\nGo, girl! Go, girl, you got it!\nYou're a Wonderbolt!\n\n\nBow Hothoof:\nAttagirl!\nYeah!\nGo-go-go-go-go!\n\nWindy Whistles:\nWoo-hoo!\nGo, girl! Go, girl, you got it!\nYou're a Wonderbolt!\n\nFleetfoot: Wow...\n\n[crowd chattering]\nBow Hothoof: Go, Rainbow Dash! You sign that photo! Whoo!\n\nBow Hothoof and Windy Whistles: Cut the ribbon! Cut the ribbon! Cut the ribbon! Cut the ribbon!\n\n[camera flashes]\nBow Hothoof and Windy Whistles: The camera loves you! Yeah!\nBow Hothoof: Now, let's do the pyramid! Scootaloo, get up there! You're the top!\nSpitfire: [to Rainbow] You really do got yourself your very own mega-fans. Lucky you.\nRainbow Dash: [groans]\n\nRainbow Dash: [groans]\n[locker door opens]\nWindy Whistles: You hung that towel!\n[clang!]\nWindy Whistles: Yeah!\nBow Hothoof: Greatest towel hanger of all time! [chanting] Towel!\nBow Hothoof and Windy Whistles: [chanting] Towel! Towel! Towel! Towel! Towel! Towel! Towel! Tow\u2014\nRainbow Dash: Stop! This is ridiculous! Mom and Dad, you are both too supportive! This is exactly why I didn't tell you I was a Wonderbolt! You're just... too much!\nWindy Whistles: Did... Did we do something wrong?\nRainbow Dash: Yes! The fireworks, the cheerleading, and-and how do you even compare who is better or worse at hanging up a towel?!\nBow Hothoof: We're just trying to be supportive.\nRainbow Dash: Well, I'm tired of it! I've had enough of you two being so proud of every little ridiculous, insignificant thing I do! [pants] I think you should leave.\nWindy Whistles: First of all, great job yelling at us, sweetie. No one [sniffs] can make their parents feel more worthless than you!\nBow Hothoof: [through tears] Your words were direct, clear, and... so painful! Is there nothing you can't do?!\nScootaloo: Why?\nRainbow Dash: Scootaloo, you don't understand!\nScootaloo: I met your parents hoping to learn more about you, but I don't like what I found out! I'll find somepony else to do my hero report on.\n[sad music]\n\n[scooter revving]\nRainbow Dash: [panting] Scootaloo, wait! I know I wasn't myself back there, and I shouldn't have snapped at my parents! That's exactly why I didn't tell them I'm a Wonderbolt!\nScootaloo: I don't understand. They're so proud of you.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Can I tell you something?\nScootaloo: Sure.\nRainbow Dash: Okay, but you might wanna hold onto your wings because this could rock you to your very core. Believe it or not, there was a time when I wasn't the best at everything.\nScootaloo: [gasps]\nRainbow Dash: See this picture? It looks like I won something awesome, but actually...\n\nAnnouncer: And last, but not least, it's time to hand out our participant stickers!\nBow Hothoof and Windy Whistles: Yeeeeeeeaaaaahhhhh!\n\n\n\n\nBow Hothoof:\nWoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!\nYeah, Rainbow Dash!\nYou show 'em!\n\n\nWindy Whistles:\nGo, Rainbow! Go, Rainbow!\nHooray!\nYeah!\n\n\nBow Hothoof:\nWoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!\nYeah, Rainbow Dash!\nYou show 'em!\n\nWindy Whistles:\nGo, Rainbow! Go, Rainbow!\nHooray!\nYeah!\n\nBow Hothoof: Greatest participant ever!\nYoung Dumb-Bell: Uh, your parents realize you didn't win, don't they?\n[camera flashes]\n\nRainbow Dash: Granted, I was the youngest pony in the senior competitive circuit. Most other ponies my age were still in the Junior Flappers' Club. I thought it was utterly mortifying having my parents cheer me on even when I lost!\n\nRainbow Dash: [voiceover] But then, when I started to win competitions \u2013 which didn't take very long, by the way \u2013 things got even worse!\n\n\n\n\nBow Hothoof:\nYeah!\nWoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!\nYeah, Rainbow Dash, you show 'em!\n\n\nWindy Whistles:\nWhoo!\nGo, Rainbow! Go, Rainbow!\nWoo-hoo-hooo! Yeah!\n\n\nBow Hothoof:\nYeah!\nWoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!\nYeah, Rainbow Dash, you show 'em!\n\nWindy Whistles:\nWhoo!\nGo, Rainbow! Go, Rainbow!\nWoo-hoo-hooo! Yeah!\n\nRainbow Dash: [voiceover] Being the best came with consequences. Very loud, very embarrassing consequences.\n\nRainbow Dash: [sighs]\nScootaloo: Ya know, some ponies would dream of having parents like that.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, right! Name one!\nScootaloo: [sighs] Me. Growing up, I never thought I'd be the best at anything, because nopony ever told me. But your parents told you over and over again. Look! Best bath taker ever. Best carrot eater under three. Greatest napper of all time!\nRainbow Dash: [scoffs] I am pretty good at napping. I can fall asleep anywhere. [snores] Huh?\nScootaloo: For your entire life, your parents gave you the confidence to believe in yourself.\nRainbow Dash: You're right. I was always so embarrassed by my parents that I didn't realize their support actually made me the awesome, confident, amazing, awesome, and awesome pony I am! [sighs] And I took them for granted.\nScootaloo: And you yelled at them.\nRainbow Dash: [groans] I gotta make this right. I have an idea, but I'm gonna need your help. That is, if you're willing to help me after I acted like that.\n[camera flashes]\nScootaloo: Now, that's a great picture! \"Rainbow Dash learns the error of her ways\"!\n\nWindy Whistles: I'm telling you, I just can't see a thing. Scootaloo, you are just so great at blindfolds!\nBow Hothoof: It's true. You must tell me what kind of knot you used. Uh, falconer's knot? Wait, no! A farmer's loop!\nWindy Whistles: What's this all about, anywho?\n[microphone feedback]\nRainbow Dash: [over loudspeaker] Windy Whistles and Bow Hothoof, please be seated for a super private Wonderbolt event! [clears throat] Mom and Dad, welcome to the... [quickly] \"I Love My Parents and I'm Sorry That I Took Them for Granted and I Know That They Made Me Who I Am Today So I Really Wanna Make It Up to Them\"... [normally] event. Enjoy!\n[Wonderbolts' theme music]\nRainbow Dash: Thanks for doing this.\nSpitfire: Happy to help.\nBow Hothoof and Windy Whistles: Oooh... Ahhh... Oh! Ooh! [more awed excitement sounds]\nRainbow Dash: Mom and Dad, I want you to know that I'm your biggest fan.\nWindy Whistles: Oh, honey, thank you. But you didn't have to do all this. It's kind of [whispers] embarrassing.\nBow Hothoof: Eh, it is a bit much.\n[camera flashes]\n\nScootaloo: And that's why Rainbow Dash is the most inspirational pony in my life!\n[applause]\nCheerilee: Thank you, Scootaloo. Very well researched! But a little heavy on the pictures, and there was a moldy sandwich in your report. [chuckles] Um, I'll give you a B.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! Greatest report giver of all time!\nBow Hothoof, Windy Whistles, and Rainbow Dash: [chanting] Scootaloo! Scootaloo!

Rarity's reorganizing her shop, and look what she found! Old costumes from the talent show!\nScootaloo: We thought they'd come in handy in case we ever help a pony put on a play or need to make a quick escape disguised as clowns.\nApple Bloom: Here ya go, Big Mac.\nScootaloo: Whoa, that sure is a lot of apples!\nApple Bloom: Are you makin' another delivery to Starlight's old village?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nSweetie Belle: That's an awful long way for a pony to go, isn't it?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nApple Bloom: You've been goin' there a lot lately. What is this, your fifth trip this week?\nBig McIntosh: [laughs nervously] Eeyup.\nApple Bloom: Okay, well, have fun. So what other costumes did you bring, Sweetie Belle?\nScootaloo: Are you crazy?! We can't talk about costumes at a time like this!\nApple Bloom: Time like what?\nScootaloo: Your brother is hiding something. Did you see the way he was acting?\nSweetie Belle: Yeah. He totally blushed when you brought up how often he's been going to Starlight's old village.\nScootaloo: Something is definitely going on. There can be only be one reason a pony would travel so far, so often.\n\n\n\n\nScootaloo:\nHe's taking private skiing lessons!\n\n\nSweetie Belle:\nHe's training for a marathon!\n\n\nApple Bloom:\nI've been cooking a lot of broccoli...\n\n\nScootaloo:\nHe's taking private skiing lessons!\n\nSweetie Belle:\nHe's training for a marathon!\n\nApple Bloom:\nI've been cooking a lot of broccoli...\n\nApple Bloom: ...and he wants to get away from the smell!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [laughing]\n\n[theme song]\n\nScootaloo: Maybe he's a spy on a mission to thwart an evil villain with a secret weapon: an apple cannon!\nApple Bloom: No, that's crazy! I think it's my broccoli thing.\nSweetie Belle: Why don't we just ask him?\nScootaloo: You saw how shifty he was acting earlier. There's no way he'll tell us what he's doing. Plus, I really wanna go undercover. We already have costumes! Call me \"Agent Rainbowhead\".\nSweetie Belle: I'll be \"Shimmering Spectacles\", a librarian with a mysterious past.\nApple Bloom: And I'll be a pirate spy! Arrrgh! A spy-rate!\n[record scratching]\nApple Bloom: [gasps] Avast! Our ship be leavin' port!\nScootaloo: Huh?\nApple Bloom: Big Mac's leavin'! If we're gonna be spies, we gotta go! Now!\n\nBig McIntosh: [whistling]\nApple Bloom: Big Mac's a-comin'! Quick! Act like apples!\nSweetie Belle: What? How?\n[romantic music]\nSweetie Belle: Who's that pony?\nScootaloo: Let me see! I dunno. Shouldn't have taken the binoculars. I don't know anypony here.\nApple Bloom: That must be Sugar Belle. Applejack told me about her bakery. Obviously, she's just been orderin' a lot of apples.\n[door opens]\nSweetie Belle: So nothing fishy's going on.\nScootaloo: No way! We came here to be spies! And no spy I know has ever solved a case that quick!\nSweetie Belle: Mmm, how many spies do you know?\nScootaloo: That's... not important. What's important is that we do more recon. Follow my lead!\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: Mm.\n[spy music]\nApple Bloom: Whoa. She sure likes her apples.\nSweetie Belle: What is she doing? Making the biggest apple pie in Equestria?\nSugar Belle: Thanks for coming all this way, Big Mac.\nBig McIntosh: Pfft! [whinnying laugh]\nSugar Belle: It sure is nice seeing you again so soon.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup. [giggles]\nSugar Belle: All I used to bake were boring old muffins, but thanks to your apple deliveries, I get to bake all kinds of delicious treats! Apple pies, apple fritters, apple turnovers, caramel apples, caramel apple cakes... [sighs] I just wish I had more room to display it all. My shelves only hold so much.\nApple Bloom: I'm tellin' you, this pony reeeeaaally likes her apples.\nSweetie Belle: [gasps] Or Big Mac!\nApple Bloom and Scootaloo: Huh?\nSweetie Belle: Just look!\nSugar Belle: Ooh! Uh... [giggles]\nBig McIntosh: Oh, I... [giggles]\nApple Bloom: Sweetie Belle, I-I think you're right! [loudly] I think my brother has a crush!\nSweetie Belle: Shh!\n[door opens]\nApple Bloom: Psst! Big Mac! [to the Crusaders] Now remember, my brother's super shy, so he's probably gonna be embarrassed about his crush. Just try and make him feel comfortable. Hey, Big Mac, it's me! Apple Bloom!\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nSweetie Belle and Scootaloo: We're here, too!\nBig McIntosh: Mm-hmm.\nApple Bloom: I'm gonna ask you a very personal question, and I want you to answer honestly. Do you... have a crush on... Sugar Belle?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nScootaloo: Well, that was easy.\nApple Bloom: This is so excitin'! My big brother has his very first crush!\nScootaloo: First crush? What about Cheerilee?\nSweetie Belle: It doesn't really count when you trick a pony into drinking a love potion, does it?\nBig McIntosh: [angrily] Nnope!\nApple Bloom: [singsongy] My brother has a crush! My brother has a crush! My brother has a crush! [normally] Wait! Does Sugar Belle even know you like her?\nBig McIntosh: Uh-uh.\nApple Bloom: Then you gotta tell her!\nBig McIntosh: O-Oh... eh... ehhhh...\nSweetie Belle: We're pretty sure she likes you! I mean, she keeps ordering apples just so she can see you again.\nBig McIntosh: Eeeyou think so?\nScootaloo: Totally! But you'll never know if you don't try.\nBig McIntosh: Okay!\nScootaloo: Go get her, Big Mac!\nBig McIntosh: [deep breath]\n[knocking]\n[romantic music]\nFeather Bangs: [California accent] Hey, girl. Heh-heh. I was writin' poetry by the pond when I saw these flowers. I thought I'd show them how pretty you are.\nSugar Belle: Oh! Heh. Thanks, Feather Bangs.\nBig McIntosh: [sad snort]\nScootaloo: Um, is it possible to have two crushes at once? Because it looks like Big Mac may not be the only pony Sugar Belle likes.\n\nApple Bloom: Hey, Big Mac! Where ya goin'?\nBig McIntosh: Home!\nSweetie Belle: You can't let that Feather fella get in the way of your one true love!\nScootaloo: You've gotta take him down!\nApple Bloom: What can he do that you can't?\nBig McIntosh: That!\nFeather Bangs: Whoops! Heh-heh. These balls are like you. I'll always catch you if you fall.\nSwooning Ponies: [swoon]\nScootaloo: Seriously? That line worked?\nBig McIntosh: She'll never pick me.\nApple Bloom: Sure she will, 'cause we're gonna help you.\nBig McIntosh: No love potions!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [laugh]\nApple Bloom: Don't worry, Big Mac. We learned our lesson the hard way.\nScootaloo: Yeah. We're never gonna do that again.\nSweetie Belle: Besides, I know exactly what to do! When I was younger, I read all the fairy tales.\nScootaloo: When you were \"younger\", huh?\nSweetie Belle: Well, I was younger on the way here!\n[beat]\nSweetie Belle: It was a long ride! Anyway, as long as we do what the book says, you're pretty much guaranteed a happy ending. Uh, how about this one? \"Rescuing a damsel-pony-in-distress.\" That's perfect! Of course, we'll have to improvise without a dragon.\nApple Bloom: Huh. Too bad Spike isn't here. Not that he's very threatening.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [laughing]\nScootaloo: So what should we do? Wait around for Sugar Belle to get herself into a scary situation?\nApple Bloom: Or... we bring the danger to her.\nBig McIntosh: [gulps]\n\nApple Bloom: All right. Scootaloo's gonna pretend to take Sugar Belle's things, then you swoop in and stop her. Ready?\n[beat]\nBig McIntosh: Nnope.\nSweetie Belle: Come on! You're gonna be her hero! In fairy tales, the knight in shining armor always gets the girl.\nBig McIntosh: Hmmm... Mm-hmm.\nSugar Belle: Oh! Somepony, help!\n[screeching]\n[slow motion sounds]\nFeather Bangs: Here's your sugar, Sugar. Though it is not as sweet... [chuckling] ...as you.\nSwooning Ponies: [swoon]\nSugar Belle: [sighs] Thank you, Feather!\nApple Bloom: That smooth-talkin' pony stole our rescue! And it totally would've worked!\nBig McIntosh: [angry] Eeyup.\nSweetie Belle: We're just gonna have to keep trying! Big Mac, are you ready to take it up a notch?\nBig McIntosh: Oh, yup!\n\nBig McIntosh: Oh, nope.\nSweetie Belle: Trust us! There's nothing more romantic than waking your special pony from a sleeping spell with a magical kiss! See? \"They rode off into the sunset.\"\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [sigh]\nApple Bloom: Any sign of Feather Bangs?\nScootaloo: Negative! Coast is clear!\nApple Bloom: It's now or never, Big Mac!\nBig McIntosh: [gulps, nervous sounds, puckering]\nSugar Belle: [gasps]\nFeather Bangs: Oh-ho-ho, girl, you been workin' hard all day. Allow me to treat you like the princess... [chuckling] ...you are.\nBig McIntosh: [nickers]\nSwooning Ponies: [swoon]\nSweetie Belle: Hey! That's our metaphorical sunset they're riding off into!\nScootaloo: All right! This ends now! Feather Bangs may have good timing, and... a good mane... uh, but let's see him compete with a song!\nBig McIntosh: S-Say what now?\nApple Bloom: Of course! Why didn't we think of it before?\nSweetie Belle: Every great love story hinges on the romantic musical number. Big Mac, you've gotta write a song for Sugar Belle!\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\n[hoofbump]\n\nApple Bloom: Come on, Big Mac!\n\"Swoon Song\": [Valley girl accent] Feather Bangs is soooo romantic.\n\"Fond Feather\": [Valley girl accent] When he speaks, I pretend he's talking to me.\nBig McIntosh: [sighs]\nApple Bloom: Come on! You can do better than him! Just like we practiced!\nBig McIntosh: [gulps]\n\n[Big McIntosh]\nWe'll take a walk down by the river\nWatch the sunset from the field\nWe'll plant the seeds of love together\nAnd water 'em right for a really good yield\n\nWe'll take a walk down by the river\nWatch the sunset from the field\nWe'll plant the seeds of love together\nAnd water 'em right for a really good yield\n\nSugar Belle, sweet as pie\nYou're the apple of my eye\nA cherry blossom in a field of rye\nAnd when the heifer's milked and fed\nAnd the pigs are in the sty\nWon't you be there by my side?\n\nSugar Belle, sweet as pie\nYou're the apple of my eye\nA cherry blossom in a field of rye\nAnd when the heifer's milked and fed\nAnd the pigs are in the sty\nWon't you be there by my side?\n\n[Feather Bangs]\nOh, oh\nOh, ah-oh\n\nOh, oh\nOh, ah-oh\n\nWhen you appeared before me\nMy heart stopped beating\nStars crossed the sky\nTo come see what I was seeing\n\nWhen you appeared before me\nMy heart stopped beating\nStars crossed the sky\nTo come see what I was seeing\n\nYou were the one\nThat made me believe I could fly\nWhoa, whoa, whoa\n\nYou were the one\nThat made me believe I could fly\nWhoa, whoa, whoa\n\nBirds could not sing\nA song that's as beautiful\nI'd do anything\nThat's irrefutable\n\nBirds could not sing\nA song that's as beautiful\nI'd do anything\nThat's irrefutable\n\n'Cause you are the sun\nPainting my heart in the sky (whoa-oh, oh)\n\n'Cause you are the sun\nPainting my heart in the sky (whoa-oh, oh)\n\nSugar, Sugar Belle, whoa-oh\nWhen will you tell me that you feel the same?\nLike an angel on a candy cane\nOr the sunlight shining through a drain\n\nSugar, Sugar Belle, whoa-oh\nWhen will you tell me that you feel the same?\nLike an angel on a candy cane\nOr the sunlight shining through a drain\n\n[Big McIntosh]\nSugar Belle, when I look in your eyes\n[clears throat]\nI see the color blue\nAnd it reminds me of the sky above\nUh, which is also... blue\n\nSugar Belle, when I look in your eyes\n[clears throat]\nI see the color blue\nAnd it reminds me of the sky above\nUh, which is also... blue\n\n[Feather Bangs]\nHey, hey, hey, yeah\n\nHey, hey, hey, yeah\n\nBe my sugarplum\nI will be your watermelon\nEvery time you smile\nI can feel my heart a-swellin'\n\nBe my sugarplum\nI will be your watermelon\nEvery time you smile\nI can feel my heart a-swellin'\n\nBlood is rushing from my head to my hooves, yeah\nI start movin' when I'm feeling that groove, yeah\n\nBlood is rushing from my head to my hooves, yeah\nI start movin' when I'm feeling that groove, yeah\n\n[Big McIntosh]\nI've been writin' this song for you\nSearchin' for the perfect rhyme\nFor the words I wanna say\nSomethin', somethin', somethin', somethin'...

We're sorry for everything we put you through today, Sugar Belle.

Look, I-I can mane flip, write poetry, and juggle, but actually talkin' to a pony? Oh, it scares me almost as much as loneliness. Will you help me? Please?\nApple Bloom: Gee, I don't know about this.\nScootaloo: He just needs a little nudge in the conversation department. Besides, I don't think Big Mac's ready to leave just yet.\nSweetie Belle: Let's do it!\nApple Bloom: Feather Bangs, the Cutie Mark Crusaders are...\nCutie Mark Crusaders: ...at your service!

I'm so lucky you just happened to be walking past the boutique. [chuckles]\nSpike: Uh, yeah, right. Just happened to be walking past. [chuckles nervously]\nPinkie Pie: Whatcha got here? Lost dog? Balloons for sale? Guitar lessons? 'Cause I found one, I need some, and yes, I am interested! [imitating guitar riff]\nRarity: No. [chuckling] It's a call for submissions. Fashion contest I'm organizing. A showcase for aspiring young designers.\nPinkie Pie: Oh, wow! What an awesome idea!\nRarity: Thank you. I remember how difficult it was to break into the fashion industry when I was starting out. That's why the winner of the contest will get to debut their line in the Carousel Boutique!\nSpike: [dreamily] So selfless... So generous...\nRarity: I've also managed to get esteemed fashion critic Hoity Toity and iconic fashion photographer Photo Finish to come to Ponyville and judge the show. And... [squealing] Wait until you hear who else will be a judge.\nSpike: Countess Coloratura?\nPinkie Pie: Sassy Saddles?\nSpike: Spike?!\nRarity: No! [chuckling] The third judge for the Carousel Boutique's Couture du Future Fashion Contest is none other than... Applejack!\nApplejack: What?!\nPinkie Pie: What?!\nSpike: What?!\nRarity: ...What?\n\n[theme song]\n\nApplejack: What?!\nRarity: You already said that, darling.\nApplejack: I know. But I had to say it again because that's how confused I am. You want me to judge a fashion show?\nPinkie Pie: I'm sure Rarity has her reasons, and once we hear them, all of this will make sense.\nRarity: I admit, Applejack is an unorthodox choice. But that is precisely what makes her an inspired choice!\nPinkie Pie: See? Now it all... still doesn't make any sense.\nRarity: Hoity Toity has expertise in fabric and stitchwork. Photo Finish has an artistic eye for shapes and colors. But sometimes, we designers forget about practicality. That's where you come in.\nApplejack: Uh, I think I might be a little too practical. My closet's nothin' but twenty versions of this hat.\nRarity: Which tells me you're a pony who knows what she likes. Besides, a judge must be honest, and you're the most honest pony there is. Ask any pony \u2013 they'll tell you.\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! Ooh! Lemme try! [to Cherry Fizzy] Excuse me. Have you ever heard of Applejack?\nCherry Fizzy: The most honest pony there is? Sure have!\nRarity: See? So what do you say?\nApplejack: Well, if I'm bein' honest, I don't think I'm the right pony for the job. Fashion just ain't my bag of oats.\nPinkie Pie: Aw, booooo!\nRarity: I do understand your hesitation. But before you say no, sleep on it?\nApplejack: Sure, I... guess I can do that for ya.\n[shimmering magic sounds]\n\nApplejack: Yeah, I know, Big Mac. I-I was just as surprised as you are.

It sounds like fun gettin' to see all those pretty outfits!\nApplejack: Well, you're the exception in our family, sugarcube. You know about that kind o' stuff. I'd be as useful as a burned knot on a zapplin' tree. [grunts]\n[apples thudding]\nApplejack: Although... Rarity did say I just had to focus on practicality. She already has experts for the... uh, fashion-y stuff. Eh, but I still wouldn't know what to say.\n[thunk]\n[thud]\n[apples thudding]\nApplejack: Come on, Apple Bloom! You're doublin' our workload here!\nApple Bloom: Sorry. I wanted to wear a signature hat like yours, but it's makin' it harder to see.\nApplejack: That's because it's not like mine. [grunts] You don't need a fancy scarf to keep your hat on. Now you can see. [grunts]\n[apples thudding]\nApple Bloom: Wow! That is a lot better! Thanks, Applejack!\nApplejack: Sure thing. You know what? I am gonna help Rarity judge her show! I think my sensible \"everypony\" take on fashion is exactly what the pony community needs!\n\n[bell rings]\nApplejack: Rarity, I thought about it some more, and if you still need me, I'd love to be a judge.\nRarity: [squeals] I just knew you'd come around!\nPhoto Finish: I, Photo Finish, have arrived!\nHoity Toity: As has Hoity Toity.\nRarity: [gasps] It's wonderful to see you!

Who speaks?!\nRarity: Oh, uh, this is Applejack. Another one of the judges.\nHoity Toity: So, judge, what do you think?\nApplejack: Oh. Wow. Uh, that is just... wow. These are clothes?\n[music winds down]\nPhoto Finish: Ze photo is upside-down!\nApplejack: This is... [scoffs] She looks like a disco ball! Hah! D-Did they have to roll her down the runway?!

Ahem.\n\nApplejack: Oh, gosh. I didn't mean to make her faint.\nRarity: Oh, don't worry about it, darling. Uh, it happens all the time. Besides, that dress did look a bit like a disco ball. Although, Miss Pommel is making the point that, no matter what we wear, it is a costume of some kind or another.\nApplejack: I have no idea what you're talkin' about.\nRarity: And... that's okay. Let's go meet the designers and help them get ready for the show!\n\nRarity: Designers, welcome! Today you will work on your designs, and we judges will offer our guidance and advice as you prepare for tomorrow's big show.\nLily Lace, Starstreak, and Inky Rose: [excited murmuring]\nRarity: Lily Lace, tell us about your inspiration.\nLily Lace: [Valley girl accent] You guys, this morning, on my way here, I heard a bird singing literally the most beautiful song I'd ever heard! And I wanted to capture not so much the bird's song exactly but more like how the wind carried the bird's song!\nHoity Toity: Powerful yet at the same time fragile and delicate.\nApplejack: Uh... Huh?\nRarity: Next up, meet Starstreak.\nStarstreak: [panting] I'm not interested in what's already been done. Only what will exist... in the future!\nHoity Toity: Mmmm... Tomorrow's fashion belongs to those who hear it coming.\nInky Rose: I am Inky Rose.\n[pause]\nPhoto Finish: You have a very focused vision! A strong sense of what you want! It's gut!\nRarity: Applejack, you've been rather quiet. What do you think?\nApplejack: Well... it's a lot of black. It's kinda... depressing.\nInky Rose: How's this?\nHoity Toity: Makes a world of difference!\nApplejack: Maybe to fashion experts like you. But to ponies like me, it's still black.\nHoity Toity and Photo Finish: [gasps]\nApplejack: And I'm not sure how you wear singin' birds or the future. [to Rarity] I don't think they liked what I had to say.\nRarity: Ah, well, that's why you're here. Fashion needs a healthy dose of practicality now and then.\n\n[hammering]\n[rip]\nApplejack: Are you puttin' holes in the clothes?! On purpose?!\nInky Rose: It's to create a distressed look.\nApplejack: More like an old and tattered look! When a pony's old clothes get holes in 'em, they don't wanna go to the store to buy new clothes with holes in 'em!\nRarity: Okay, yes, not a very practical choice. Fashionable, but not practical.\nPhoto Finish: Simply shtunning!\nApplejack: Sure, it looks pretty, but that's a lot of fabric. With the way it drags behind, it'll be covered in dirt in no time. Thank goodness I'm here. Otherwise, we'd have had holes in clothes and dirty dresses.\nLily Lace: [whimper]\nApplejack: [groans]\nRarity: But of course, no look is complete without mane and makeup!\nApplejack: So, uh... when are you gonna do her mane?\nStarstreak: Ugh! It's already been done!\nRarity: You know what? Uh, I think we've given the designers enough guidance for today. Let's, uh, let them finish their work.\nApplejack: Uh, can't wait to see what y'all do for the big show tomorrow!\nLily Lace: I literally don't know why...\nStarstreak: [simultaneously] I am so offended.\nInky Rose: [simultaneous grumbling] That was so insensitive...\nRarity: [chuckling nervously, sighs]\n\n[acoustic guitar chord]\nPinkie Pie: Hey, Applejack! On your way home? How'd the first day of the contest go?\nApplejack: Heh! Great! At first, I didn't think I'd be much help. But thank goodness I signed on! Without me, they'd be doin' all kinds of crazy fashion-y things!\n[off-key guitar chord]\nPinkie Pie: Hey, Rarity! Applejack says the contest is going great! Good thing she's there, huh?\nRarity: Yes, of course... Some of her thoughts are tough to swallow, but hopefully her candor will help the designers achieve the best designs possible.\nPinkie Pie: You seem a little stressed. Wanna try? Music is very relaxing. [strums guitar]\nRarity: Sure... Hmm.\n[hard rock solo]\nRarity: [sighs] Much better.\nPinkie Pie: [blows]\n\nRarity: [inhale, exhale] I can meet my goals. Today is a fresh start. Good morning, everypony! Time for final adjustments before the show!\nHoity Toity: If buttons could convey sadness, you've done it.\nApplejack: To me, they convey wakin' up an hour early just to button 'em all! And that's if you could reach most of 'em!\n[buttons clattering]\n\nInky Rose: Is this better?\nApplejack: Heh. There you go! Now when it's cold, you just slide it on ya, and you're set. Like a poncho!\nHoity Toity: Um... poncho?\nLily Lace: I attached each feather individually! [laughs] It took me for-literally-ever! [laughs]\nHoity Toity: Ohhhhh. You used hoof-cross-double-over stitches! [chuckles] They're perfect!\nApplejack: Who cares if it's stitched perfectly? You don't need feathers on your head!\n[feathers fluttering]\nRarity, Hoity Toity, and Lily Lace: [gasps]\nPhoto Finish: Gasp!\nApplejack: My little sister tried to add some flair to her hat, and guess what it got her \u2013 an extra hour of work pickin' apples off the ground!\nPhoto Finish: A good start, but it needs more. No. No. No. Yes!\nHoity Toity: I'd go with this one.\nPhoto Finish: No, this one!\nApplejack: [chuckling]\nPhoto Finish: Something is funny?\nApplejack: What? Oh, no. Uh, it's just, I mean... Those belts look the same.\nHoity Toity: Well, that one completely changes the look. This one complements it.\nApplejack: You're kiddin', right?\nRarity: Is everything okay?\nApplejack: They're havin' a heated debate about those two belts.\nRarity: Ooh! Both good choices.\nApplejack: No! There is no choice! They're the exact same belt! Ugh! This is so silly! Fashion is ridiculous!\nAll except Applejack: [gasps]\nRarity: You don't mean that!\nApplejack: I do! I'm sorry, but that's my honest opinion!\nHoity Toity: Well! I never would've come if I knew we were going to be insulted!\nPhoto Finish: We go!\nRarity: No! Please! Come back!\nStarstreak: If they're out, I'm out, too. I didn't get into fashion to design boring utilitarian clothes!\nLily Lace: I want to create elegance and drama! And this is literally the opposite of\u2014! [scoffs] I mean\u2014! [scoffs] I can't even! [guttural scoff]\nInky Rose: Yeah... no.\nRarity: [sobbing]\nApplejack: What? I was just bein' honest!\n\nJack Hammer and Steam Roller: [grunting]\nRarity: Stop everything! There is no show! Take it all down!\nPinkie Pie: Rarity, what's going on? Is everything okay?\nRarity: No! It is the opposite of okay! The judges have quit! The designers have dropped out! The show is cancelled! All my good intentions squashed! [sobbing] And it's all Applejack's fault!\nApplejack: Why are you mad at me?! I was just sayin' what I thought! And isn't that why you wanted me to be a judge?! For my honesty?!\nRarity: Of course! But you said fashion is ridiculous!\nApplejack: But it's my opinion! And I'm not gonna lie!\nRarity: Oh\u2014! [scoffs] Come with me!\n\n[knock, knock!]\n[door opens]\nStrawberry Sunrise: [chewing] Mmmm! [gulp] Oh! [chuckling] Rarity! Oh, what a nice surprise!\nRarity: Hello, Strawberry Sunrise. This is Applejack. I was wondering if you could tell her how you feel about apples.\nStrawberry Sunrise: Don't like 'em.\nApplejack: What?! Why?! They're crunchy, they're sweet, they're delicious.\nStrawberry Sunrise: [chuckles] They're not strawberries. [chewing] Mmmm! [gulp]\nApplejack: You're right! Apples are better than strawberries!\nStrawberry Sunrise: Only if, by \"better\", you mean \"better at being disgusting\".\nApplejack: [stammering] You'd better apologize!\nStrawberry Sunrise: Oh, I'm sorry... that you actually bite into those tasteless, mealyworm-filled things. Ohhh.\n[door slams]\nApplejack: What?!? [growling]\nRarity: Applejack, why are you so angry? It's just Strawberry's honest opinion. What's wrong with that?\nApplejack: Well, that's fine if she doesn't like 'em! But if she knew how hard we worked to make our apples perfect, maybe she wouldn't be so mean about\u2014! ...Ohhhhhhh... Oh, boy.\nRarity: Mm-hmm. Doesn't feel so good, does it?\nApplejack: Nope. No, it does not at all. [sighs] I am so sorry, Rarity. I got so carried away with bein' honest, I guess I didn't think about how I was makin' others feel. [sighs] I'm a real rotten apple.\nRarity: I appreciate that, Applejack. That means a lot. I just wish you'd realized it before you ruined the fashion show.\n\nHoity Toity: I need to get some of these.\nPhoto Finish: It's the only way to travel.\n[rumbling]\nPhoto Finish: What are you doing?!\nHoity Toity: Canterlot is that way.\nApplejack: Yup. But you're not goin' back to Canterlot yet.\n\nApplejack: Hey!\nLily Lace: What is she\u2014?! [scoffs]\nStarstreak: I don't know.\nInky Rose: Run.\nApplejack: [panting]\nLily Lace, Starstreak, and Inky Rose: [panting]\nLily Lace: I can't even!\n\nApplejack: Whew... Listen, y'all. I thought I was just bein' honest when I said all those things. But somepony helped me realize I was actually bein' hurtful. So for that, I apologize.\nPhoto Finish: Zo! You don't think fashion is ridiculous?!\nApplejack: Uh... Well, I, uh... I still don't understand it. But I appreciate how much it means to y'all and how much hard work you put into it. I also know this contest is important to Rarity. So what do you say?\nHoity Toity: Well, I'd hate to have come all this way here and not see what you can do.\nStarstreak: If they're judging, we're in.\nLily Lace: Under one condition. Literally.\nApplejack: Anything.\nInky Rose: Untie us.\n\n[clanking]\nApplejack: Show's back on, fellers!\nHard Hat, \"Rivet\", Jack Hammer, and Steam Roller: [groaning]\nApplejack: [grunting] Ahhh...\n\n[sewing machine whirring]\n[screech]\n[muffled humming]\nApplejack: [grunting]\n[sewing machine whirring]\nApplejack: Aah!\n[fwump!]\nApplejack: [laughing]\nStarstreak: [laughing]\n\nInky Rose: Uh-uh. Uh-huh.\n\n[shimmering magic sounds]\n\nPinkie Pie: ...And then, Applejack found me and told me to distract you for an hour. But the hour's up! Ta-da!\nRarity: B-B-But how?! They were all leaving. This was all coming down.\nLily Lace: You can thank Applejack. She literally did it all by herself.\nApplejack: I don't think that word means what you think it means. But I did bust my tail because I know how much this means to you.\nRarity: Ohhhhh! Thank you, Applejack.\nPhoto Finish: We start now!\n\n[techno music]\nRarity: First up, Lily Lace!\n[camera clicking]\nRarity: Starstreak!\n[camera clicking]\nRarity: Inky Rose!\n[camera clicking]\nRarity: And now, it's time to vote. I am drawn to the beauty and drama of fashion, and nopony does drama better than Lily Lace, so I vote for her.\nLily Lace: It means sooooo much to me! I literally can't even! [guttural scoff]\nHoity Toity: Simplicity is the keynote of true elegance. That is why I vote for Inky Rose.\nInky Rose: You've... made me so... happy?\nPhoto Finish: Fashion is the art! I, Photo Finish, vote for Starstreak!\nStarstreak: Wonderful to hear, darling.\nRarity: Well, it all comes down to you, Applejack.\nPinkie Pie: Can you believe it?! After everything that's happened, Applejack is the deciding vote! [screams] This is so exciting! Eeeeee!\nRarity: Well, Applejack?\nApplejack: [sucks air through teeth] Uh... Heh. U-Uh... Uh...\n\nRarity: Lily Lace's clothes go here, Inky Rose's will go there, and Starstreak's there.\nApplejack: Sorry, but I couldn't pick just one. They all did great, and in my opinion, they all deserve to win.\nRarity: And I agree. I told you your perspective would be beneficial.\nApplejack: Is, uh, this one of your new designs, Rarity? It's, uh... Uh, the form is... reminiscent of, uh... I mean, it conjures up images of... uh... well, uh... I-I mean...\nRarity: Oh, that? No! I totally messed that one up! It's ghastly! Horrid! Absolutely terrible!\nApplejack: Hah. Oh, thank goodness. 'Cause in my honest opinion... it's awful.\nRarity: Pffft!\nRarity and Applejack: [laughing]\nRarity: When you're right, you're right!\nApplejack: I am relieved!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nTwilight Sparkle: [strained gasping]\nStarlight Glimmer: I know! I can't believe it either! The map has never called me before!\nSpike: I'm sure that's not why she looks... like that.\nTwilight Sparkle: [babbles] Actually, it is. Well, it's that and the fact that you're being called to the royal palace! I mean, what in Equestria could be going on there?! You want me to come with you?! No. I shouldn't. The map just called you for a reason, right? Heh. Though maybe it's a mistake. Not because of you! Because it's never called just one of us before. [nervous chuckle]\nStarlight Glimmer: I also wasn't nervous before, but now...\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't worry. For all we know, it's something small. Like maybe the cooks are fighting over who has the best butternut squash soup. Or the royal hairdressers are fighting over a comb.\nSpike: Or, you know, maybe the royal sisters aren't seeing eye-to-eye on something.\nTwilight Sparkle: No! That's just crazy! Luna and Celestia would never fight. [beat] Again.\n\nPrincess Celestia: So the map sent you to solve a friendship problem?\nStarlight Glimmer: Yes, princess.\nPrincess Celestia: Well, there's nothing wrong here. Right, sister?\nPrincess Luna: [sourly] No. Everything's perfect as usual, sister.\n\n[theme song]\n\n[door opens]\n[door closes]\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans]\nTwilight Sparkle: Psst! Pssst!\n[music box playing]\nStarlight Glimmer: Twilight? Is that you? How are you here?\nTwilight Sparkle: [quickly] I'm not. I'm still home. It's an easy spell. I'll show you later. Anyway, enough about me. I had to check on you. Not in a meddling kind of way! In a friendly \"how's it going?\" kind of way. So, how's it going?\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] Not great. I think the problem might be between Celestia and Luna.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, no, that's terrible! I mean, what makes you say that?\nStarlight Glimmer: You know how some ponies say nothing's wrong but you can tell something's definitely wrong?\nTwilight Sparkle: [nervously] Noooooo... Heh.\nStarlight Glimmer: That's basically what the princesses did when I said there was a friendship problem. Only they did it more, you know, regally.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, I wish I could help you, but I can't \u2013 both for map reasons and because I have no idea! This is big! Like, really big! But I'm here if you ever need to talk. Or listen to music.\n[music box playing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Heh. Comforting, right?\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Thank you so much for breakfast, princess. I can't believe you cook it yourself.\nPrincess Celestia: Of course, Starlight! I really enjoy doing it. It's a small way to say I care.\n[door opens]\nPrincess Celestia: Good morning, sister! Join us?\nPrincess Luna: [sourly] Too tired. [chomp] Please excuse me.\nStarlight Glimmer: Wow. Last night must've been really hard on her.\nPrincess Celestia: [sighs] Perhaps. But she is like this every morning.\n[clatter]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: So I think Luna may be hurting her sister's feelings without even realizing it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Poor Celestia. That's so sweet that she makes her sister pancakes every morning.\nStarlight Glimmer: She's your mentor. I think you might be biased.\nTwilight Sparkle: Fair enough. So what are you gonna do?\nStarlight Glimmer: Nothing, yet. I have to get all the facts. I asked Luna if I could spend some time with her this evening.\n[knock, knock, knock]\n[door opens]\nGuard: Princess Luna's waiting for you, miss.\nStarlight Glimmer: [chuckling nervously]\nTwilight Sparkle: Good luck, Starlight!\nGuard: [surprised whinny]\n[door closes]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Wow, Princess Luna. You do this every night?\nPrincess Luna: Lavender's calming scent is known to aid dreamers in achieving a restorative sleep.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sniffs] That's so thoughtful!\nPrincess Luna: I try my best to make sure the ponies in this castle sleep peacefully.\n[door opens]\nFleur De Verre: And so, then I said, \"Touring? More like 'boring'!\" [airy laughter]\nPrincess Celestia: [laughs] Oh, you really are a card!\nPrincess Luna: [sighs] But as always, my sister is too busy having fun with dignitary ponies to acknowledge anything I do. Hmph!\n\nStarlight Glimmer: So, both princesses are hurting each other without realizing it. And instead of talking about it, they're just getting colder and more distant.\nTwilight Sparkle: And they're Celestia and Luna. So it's not like you can just confront them.\nStarlight Glimmer: Actually, that's exactly what I was gonna do.\nTwilight Sparkle: What?! Are you crazy?! I mean, heh, you do whatever you think is best. This is your mission.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sarcastically] Gee, thanks for believing in me, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: I do. But the last time the princesses fought, Luna turned into Nightmare Moon, and Princess Celestia had to banish her for a thousand years! That can't happen again!\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, I can't do nothing. The princesses aren't the best at communicating with each other.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Sorry. It's just, you said \"princesses\" and \"aren't the best\" in the same sentence, and it's making me nervous!\n[thud]\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm not much help, am I?\nStarlight Glimmer: No!\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Wow. I almost feel bad eating this. It's adorable.\nPrincess Celestia: Like I said, I enjoy this part.\n[door opens]\nPrincess Luna: [sourly, mouth full] Hi.\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, Princess Luna! Wait! [deep breath] As you both know, the map sent me here for a reason, and I... think I found out what it is.\nPrincess Celestia: Really? Oh, that is wonderful, Starlight! What is it?\nStarlight Glimmer: You two.\nPrincess Celestia: Excuse me?\nPrincess Luna: [simultaneous] I beg your pardon?\nStarlight Glimmer: I think you're accidentally hurting each other's feelings without realizing it. Princess Celestia, does it bother you that Luna never notices the wonderful breakfasts that you prepare for her?\nPrincess Celestia: Uh... Y-Yes. It does.\nStarlight Glimmer: Princess Luna, tell Celestia how you feel about the fact that she never acknowledges the work you put into lining the hallway with lavender every night.\nPrincess Luna: I... Well, I... I-It's not the best feeling. [to Celestia] I'm sorry I never noticed that you make fruit faces on pancakes, but nights are long for me. You might be a morning pony, but I am half-asleep.\nPrincess Celestia: You think I don't get tired? I'm exhausted! Oh, I apologize for not noticing flowers in a wall sconce. But by the time I get to retire for the night, I can barely see straight! Even so, I still make an effort to smile!\nPrincess Luna: Like smiling is so hard.\nStarlight Glimmer: I-I-I'm sure that's not what Princess Luna meant to say.\nPrincess Luna: Is that what exhausts you? Smiling and being adored by everypony?\nPrincess Celestia: And you have it so much worse, do you?! You've spent your evenings flitting around giving ponies lovely dreams! Oh, it sounds just awful!\nStarlight Glimmer: [chuckles] Okay! I feel like we should step back, take a deep breath...\nPrincess Luna: Don't presume to know what it is like to govern the dream realm!\nPrincess Celestia: And yet you know exactly what it's like to be me?! Oh, please!\nStarlight Glimmer: Enough!\n[shimmering magic sounds]\nStarlight Glimmer: There! Now you'll know exactly what it's like to... be each other. [gulp]\n\nPrincess Celestia: [gasps] What have you done?!\nStarlight Glimmer: I... went with my gut?\nPrincess Luna: Switch our cutie marks back this instant!\nStarlight Glimmer: My apologies, your majesties! But I can't, even if I wanted to. The spell lasts twenty-four hours. I-It may have been extreme, but, uh, I think it's still a good idea?\nPrincess Celestia: [serious] What?\nStarlight Glimmer: Y-You said it yourselves! Neither of you believes your sister knows how hard it is to be you. So this is your chance to prove it.\nPrincess Luna: Well, I could use an easy day followed by a good night's sleep.\nPrincess Celestia: You can try. I haven't had an easy day in, well, ever! But now, I get to sleep, and tonight will be a breeze. All right, Starlight Glimmer. We will do this.\nStarlight Glimmer: Good choice! Not that you had one. [chuckles]\nPrincess Celestia and Princess Luna: [snort]\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm gonna stop talking now.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [hyperventilating] You switched their cutie marks?! The actual princesses' cutie marks?!\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans] I thought we moved past this. It was the right call! I hope.\nTwilight Sparkle: [hyperventilating]\n[pounding on door]\nGuard: Are you okay in there?\nStarlight Glimmer: I-I'm good! Just, uh... reading an exciting book! [whispering to Twilight] He's gonna think I'm nuts!\nTwilight Sparkle: He's not the only one.\n[drawer opens]\n[drawer slams]\n\nPrincess Luna: As you can see, Celestia and I are switching places today.\n[confused murmuring]\nPrincess Luna: I assure you, I am more than capable of handling all of Celestia's, heh, duties. Dismissed.\n[nervous murmuring]\nPrincess Luna: So, what is first on my dear sister's to-do list?\nStarlight Glimmer: It says you have a few public appearances. Store openings, judging the royal rose contest... You know, that sort of thing.\nPrincess Luna: [chuckles] Oh, I knew today would be easy, but I didn't think it would be that easy.\n\n[happy montage music]\n\n[scissors clipping]\n[applause]\n\nPrincess Luna: [sniffing]\n[whiffle!]\n\nPrincess Luna: [creaking]\n[camera clicks]\n\nPrincess Luna: \"Princess Luna Unhappy with Student Fundraiser\"? But I wasn't unhappy!\nStarlight Glimmer: Um, you are scowling.\nPrincess Luna: Well, I-I didn't mean to! I've been smiling all day! My cheeks hurt! I stopped for one second! And that's when he took the picture!\nStarlight Glimmer: Guess smiling all day isn't as easy as you thought?\nPrincess Luna: It says here that, because of me, the school didn't raise enough funds to go on their field trip! I-I didn't mean for that to happen!\n[thud]\nStarlight Glimmer: I know. But you can't dwell on that now. According to the list, some delegates are about to arrive for a luncheon. You need to dispel rumors of timberwolves in the White Tail Woods. The nearby towns have been in a state of panic for weeks.\nPrincess Luna: B-B-But I have to fix this!\nStarlight Glimmer: You can't. You need to put on a brave face and help these ponies. It's what Celestia would do.\n[door opens]\nPrincess Luna: [deep breath, shouting] Hello! Great news! There are no timberwolves!\n[slam]\nDelegate Ponies: No, there are definitely timberwolves!\nPrincess Luna: I'm sorry. But I couldn't stop thinking about those poor students. Normally, I have all the time in solitude I need to work through my problems at my own pace.\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, your sister doesn't get that luxury.\nMayor Cream Cheese: [muffled] The princess will definitely side with me!\nMayor Baltimare: [simultaneous, muffled] Please see reason, Mayor Cream Cheese! I'm telling you, Baltimare...\nStarlight Glimmer: Ready for the town hall?\nPrincess Luna: [sighs]\nMayor Cream Cheese and Mayor Baltimare: [continued arguing]\n\nMayor Baltimare: Glad that's settled.\nMayor Cream Cheese: [chuckles] And it only took three hours.\nMayor Baltimare: That got heated, didn't it?\nMayor Cream Cheese: Still on for golf?\nMayor Baltimare: Oh, absolutely.\nMayor Cream Cheese: [chuckles]\nStarlight Glimmer: You made it to the end of the day. Yay?\nPrincess Luna: Hmm? Oh. Yes, uh... [yawns] I'm just going to turn in, then. Good light, Starnight. [yawns]\nPrincess Celestia: Oh, hello, Starlight. I don't know about you, but I feel very well-rested. Where's Luna?\nStarlight Glimmer: Um, uh, she already turned in for the night.\nPrincess Celestia: Did she now? It seems my duties were harder than my sister expected.\n\nPrincess Celestia: Moon raised! It's even easier than raising the sun. [chuckles] What's next?\nStarlight Glimmer: [snoring]\nPrincess Celestia: Of course. Everypony's asleep at night. Heh. Luna works alone... Oh, but it's nothing I can't handle. All I have to do is watch over Equestria, visit the dream realm, and protect ponies in their nightmares. My list was three times as long! [chuckles]\n[lightswitches clicking]\nPrincess Celestia: All right. Everypony's asleep. You're talking to yourself, Celestia. Heh. But there's nopony else to talk to! [chuckles] Yet. I can talk to ponies in their dreams!\n[vooooom]\n[whimsical music]\nPrincess Celestia: Now, to save some ponies from their nightmares. Which aren't real, so it shouldn't be too hard, right? Right. Good call, Celestia! And I'm talking to myself again.\nStarlight Glimmer: [screaming]\nPancakes: [in Celestia's voice] I care. I care. I care. [distorted] I care.\nStarlight Glimmer: [screaming] Ugh! No!\nTwilight Sparkle: This is big! Like, really big!\nStarlight Glimmer: [yelping]\nPrincess Celestia: Starlight! I'm here now. Tell me what's wrong.\nStarlight Glimmer: [panting] Going with my gut was the wrong call! I was supposed to bring you two closer together! But I've only driven you apart! If you two can't see why you need each other, then\u2014!\nNightmare Moon: Then I am back! [laughing evilly]\nPrincess Celestia: Don't worry, Starlight. I know how to handle Nightmare Moon.\nDaybreaker: Yes! But can you handle... me?! [laughing evilly]\n\nDaybreaker: [laughing evilly]\nPrincess Celestia: This can't be!\nDaybreaker: If Luna can turn into Nightmare Moon, you can absolutely turn into me \u2014 Daybreaker! The better, prettier, and more powerful version of you!\nPrincess Celestia: No! I'll never turn into you!\nDaybreaker: Deep inside, you know how powerful you are. You don't need Luna.\nPrincess Celestia: That's not true! Even when we were apart, I knew I needed her!\nDaybreaker: [laughs] Oh, please! You don't need anypony! You can do whatever you want. And all you have to do is get rid of anypony who stands in your way!\n[magic zap]\nDaybreaker: I never should've banished you to the moon! I should've destroyed you!\nStarlight Glimmer: No, you can't do that! Day, night, sun, moon \u2014 Equestria needs both of you!\n[magic zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Without balance, there's no harmony!\n[boom!]\nNightmare Moon: [growls]\nDaybreaker: Who needs balance when you can have it all?! [laughs]\n[magic zap]\nDaybreaker: Ugh!\nNightmare Moon: You can't get rid of me so easily, sister! Unless you plan on smiling me to smithereens!\nPrincess Celestia: Enough!\nDaybreaker: [laughs] I told you I was more powerful than you!\n[magic humming]\nDaybreaker: Ugh. So much black. We get it. You're sad. You could really use some... sun!\n[flames roaring]\nStarlight Glimmer: [gasps]\n[shimmering magic sounds]\n[flames roaring]\nPrincess Celestia and Starlight Glimmer: [grunting]\nStarlight Glimmer: This is all my fault! I never should've gone on this mission! Now Equestria is doomed!\n\nDream Ponies: [singsongy] That smile's too wide... It's obviously not real...\nDream Pony: Why don't you want us to go on our field trip?\nPrincess Luna: [through teeth gaps] I don't...!\n[teeth clattering]\nPrincess Luna: I mean, I do!\nDream Ponies: [singsongy] That smile's too wide... It's obviously not real...\nPrincess Luna: Celestia! I'm so glad you're...!\n[magic zaps]\nPrincess Luna: [speaking normally] I've seen a lot, but I haven't seen this before.\nPrincess Celestia: It's Starlight Glimmer's. She's afraid this is what will happen if we continue to fight!\nStarlight Glimmer: [sobbing] What was I thinking?! I'm never going with my gut again!\nPrincess Luna: If you don't fix this soon, it could have a grave consequence on Starlight's psyche.\nPrincess Celestia: But my magic isn't powerful enough! I thought if we worked together...!\nPrincess Luna: I have your magic, remember? It doesn't work in the dream realm. It has to be you!\nPrincess Celestia: Oh, Luna, I can't do this! I was wrong! Your job is so incredibly hard! You have to battle nightmares and work in the darkness and do it all alone! It takes such a brave, strong pony to do what you do!\nPrincess Luna: And that pony is you. I walked a day in your shoes. I thought all you had to do was smile and be adored all the time, but I was wrong. There is so much more to it than that.\nDaybreaker: [laughing maniacally]\n[magic zaps]\nNightmare Moon: [screams] Ugh!\nDaybreaker: [laughing maniacally]\n[flames roaring]\nStarlight Glimmer: Don't do this to each other!\nPrincess Luna: In order to defeat Daybreaker, you need only to trust in your strength as I do.\n[magic zaps]\nDaybreaker: You can't destroy me! I'm everything you want to be!\nPrincess Celestia: No, you're not! You are not real, and you will never exist again!\nDaybreaker: [groans]\n[pop!]\nPrincess Luna: You did it!\nPrincess Celestia: Only because you were here. I don't know how you do this alone.\nPrincess Luna: So, um, did you talk to yourself?\nPrincess Celestia: Um, a little.\nPrincess Celestia and Princess Luna: [laughing]\nStarlight Glimmer: Is this really happening, or is this still a dream?\n[vooooom]\n\nPrincess Luna: Welcome back, sister! I know you had a long night, so I made you some pancakes!\nPrincess Celestia: Oh! Heh. H-How... eh, nice. Ahem. [chews, gags, gulps] They're... delicious. Heh. Thank you.\nPrincess Luna: [laughs] I know that face! They're not. I know you have to be perfect for everypony else, and you do an amazing job. But you don't have to do it for me.\nPrincess Celestia: In that case, they are terrible!\nPrincess Celestia and Princess Luna: [laughing]\nPrincess Luna: I know!\nPrincess Celestia: [sighs] But it means a lot that you tried. I love you, sister.\nPrincess Luna: I love you too.\nStarlight Glimmer: So... this was real. [yawns] Or... was it not real, and this just happened now and-and not in my dream? I'm so confused.\nPrincess Celestia: [laughing] It's all real. It was the right call going with your gut.\nPrincess Luna: The map was wise to send you, Starlight. Nopony else would have been so bold as to do what you did.\nStarlight Glimmer: That's a nice way of saying I came dangerously close to messing everything up.\nPrincess Celestia: It was just what we needed. The experience has made us closer than ever.\n[shimmering magic sounds]\nStarlight Glimmer: Wait. I'm not doing this.\n[cutie mark ringing]\nPrincess Celestia: I believe that one means your mission is complete.\nStarlight Glimmer: Wow! I can't wait to tell Twilight!\n[teleportation zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: [quickly] I already know! I mean, I don't know everything. I just got here to bring you your toothbrush! So this is just a friendly visit! Not interfering because I was worried! I wasn't! I knew you could do it, and I'm so, so, so, so, so proud of you! Tell me everything! Start from after I hyperventilated, and don't leave out any details!\nPrincess Luna: Oh, uh, by the way, there's a field trip you need to make happen and a \u2013 ahem \u2013 timberwolf issue you need to address.\nPrincess Celestia: W-What?\nPrincess Luna: Oh!

I didn't know that was part of the sacred holiday. So this angry display of destruction is part of the festivies. Huh. And here I thought you yaks were just in a bad mood.\nPrince Rutherford: No. Stomping relaxes yaks. [grunting] Yaks' head never been so clear.\nYaks: [grunting]\nPinkie Pie: This is awesome!

But thought pink pony might not recognize town since decorated for Yickslurbertfest.\nPinkie Pie: You're right! It's so different, now that you've pointed it out. [chuckles]\nPrince Rutherford: Oh, yaks not just have eye for decorating. Yaks also amazing builders!\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] No way! I thought you hired professional contractors!\n[splat]\nPinkie Pie: Here.

Well, I'm sure it'll be okay, 'cause you probably have a Plan B.\nPrince Rutherford: Yes. Yaks wait for snow to melt.\nPinkie Pie: All this snow?! It'll take a thousand moons before it melts!\nPrince Rutherford: Yaks known for their patience.\nPinkie Pie: Well... be that as it may, in the meantime, what will you eat? Where will you sleep?\nPrince Rutherford: Dah! Yaks can make this work! Hardship make yaks the strong yaks that yaks are! If pink pony disagrees, then she can leave Yakyakistan and never return!\nPinkie Pie: [yelps] Uh, of course pink pony agrees with you! [nervous chuckle] Hey, let's try out some snow recipes!

They can't make it work!\nPrince Rutherford: Yaks stop swaying! Music over!\nPinkie Pie: If Twilight and the others knew what was going on, they would be here to help in a pony's heartbeat. We have to convince Prince Rutherford that asking for help is okay. Will you help me, Gummy?\nGummy: [low gurgle]\nPinkie Pie: Thank you! And see? Asking you to help wasn't hard at all.\nGummy: [slurp]\n\nPinkie Pie: Pink pony has gathered you around the new ceremonial yak fire pit to tell you a story! A yak tradition, right?\nYaks: [general agreement]\nPinkie Pie: Yay! This is a story about a group of... uh, goats!\n\nPinkie Pie: [voiceover] Who lived in the desert. There was a sandstorm, and their entire village was buried in sand. There was nothing they could do. They knew they could not survive by only eating sand...wiches!\n\nPinkie Pie: [giggles] Get it?\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: ...Okay. Anyway...\n\nPinkie Pie: [voiceover] Finally, the goats' brave, wise leader \u2013 let's just call him Prince... uh... Drutherford [giggles] \u2013 decides that they couldn't do it by themselves. So he asked the neighboring town of, uh, Bovineville to come help them. [giggles] Yeah! Cows! The magical cows helped the goats, everyone survived, and lived happily ever after!\n\nPinkie Pie: Because they asked for help. The end!\nYaks: [cheering]\nPinkie Pie: So what is the moral of that story? Is it \u2013 A \u2013 asking for help is okay? B \u2013 asking for help saves the day? Or \u2013 C \u2013 asking for help is good for everypony?\nPrince Rutherford: D \u2013 goats weak and horrible! Magic bovines need to stay out of goats' business!\nPinkie Pie: Um... [nervous chuckle] Not quite. Any yak wanna shout out another answer?\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: [whines]\n\nPinkie Pie: Hey, Prince Rutherford. I wanna talk to you about something. Uh, what are you doing?\nPrince Rutherford: Uh, yak's snow bed got a little melty last night.\nPinkie Pie: Okay, yeah. That's what I wanna talk to you about. You know, these yak snow beds are the fluffiest I've ever slept in. They're so comfortable, you forget that it's just a cold block of ice. And the yak snow sandwiches? Mm-mmm! I hate it when food burns your mouth or overwhelms it with flavor!\nPrince Rutherford: Ah! Yak hates that, too!\nPinkie Pie: You know who would really, really enjoy these snow sandwiches? Twilight Sparkle and the other ponies! Oh, hey! I have an idea! Why don't I go to Ponyville and bring them back here?\nPrince Rutherford: Ponies like snow sandwich?\nPinkie Pie: Oh! Ponies love snow sandwiches! And hey, while they're here, you can ask if they'll clear the snow away. Fun, right?\nPrince Rutherford: When prince was little yak, prince stomped on ground too hard. Made deep hole and fell into hole. Ice froze over hole. Prince waved to friends and family from inside frozen hole. Waited for spring thaw. Prince survived on own.\nPinkie Pie: W-W-Wait a minute. You spent the whole winter in a hole?\nPrince Rutherford: Yes. And yak never asked for help!\nPrince Rutherford and yak: [grunts]\nPinkie Pie: Okay. First of all, how did you make such a deep hole from stomping? And how did it freeze over so fast? And how could you see your family and friends to wave to them from inside a frozen hole? Even if all that was possible, how did you breathe in there?!\n[slam!]\nPrince Rutherford: Yaks don't ask for help!\nPinkie Pie: But the yaks are hungry! And who knows when the snow will melt? I just don't understand why\u2014\nPrince Rutherford: Ah, yes. Is clear now that pink pony does not understand yaks. Honorary yak status rescinded! Bang! Pretend there is door! I just slammed it!\nPinkie Pie: Fine! Be stubborn!\n\nPinkie Pie: [groans] Those yaks are so stubborn! They refuse to ask for help, even though they need it! Well, this official friendship ambassador is gonna take matters into her own hooves! I'll show them!\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: [sighs] You're right, Gummy. I am too worked up. Road trip game would officially calm me down. I know! Let's play Twenty Million Questions! You think of something, then I'll ask you twenty million questions until I can come up with what you're thinking of! Let's go! Is it blue? Is it green? Is it red? Is it greenish-red? Is it reddish-blue? Is it bigger than a bread box? Is it smaller than a bread box? Is it a bread box? Is it bread?\n\nPinkie Pie: ...Is it teeth? Is it Granny Smith's dentures? Is it you? Is it a rooster? Is it a red rooster? Is it a red rooster eating corn? Ah! Used up all twenty million questions! Oh, well. We're here anyway.\n\nPrince Rutherford: Official pony balloon still here? Pink pony gone because pink pony not tough like yaks! Horn bump in agreement! Now!\nYaks: [grunting]\nPrince Rutherford: [chomp, chewing] Pleh! Snow sandwich lose novelty! Snow couscous for dinner!\nYaks: [disappointed grunt]\n\nPinkie Pie: Then Prince Rutherford said, [imitating Prince Rutherford] \"Bang! Pretend there is door! I just slammed it!\"\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie\u2014\nPinkie Pie: So then pink pony said, [high-pitched] \"Fine! Be stubborn!\"\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, we have to help the yaks.\nPinkie Pie: So in conclusion, we have to help the yaks!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmm?\nApplejack: Just go with it, hon.\nTwilight Sparkle: Great idea, Pinkie. We'll be happy to help the yaks. This is what friendship is all about.\nApplejack: Hey! I'll bring apples. This season's batch are extra juicy.\nRarity: And I shall provide the yaks with Equestria's finest textiles. They'll be silky and warm with hints of gold to complement their horns\u2014\nPinkie Pie: Stop! We can't bring the yaks any pony stuff!\nFluttershy: Why not?\nPinkie Pie: The yaks are very proud. They won't ask for help. You know what they say \u2013 \"you can lead a yak to water, but you better not let him know you're doing it.\"\nRainbow Dash: Nopony says that. Do they?\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay then. This'll be an official covert friendship mission.\nApplejack, Fluttershy, and Rarity: Mm-hmm!\nRainbow Dash: You got it!\nPinkie Pie: [excited giggling]\n\nPinkie Pie: Is it yellow? Is it slimy? Is it slimy yellow?\nRainbow Dash: We're not playing that!\n\nPinkie Pie: First, we have to infiltrate the yak compound. [grunts]\n[clang]\nPinkie Pie: These walls are high. Sneaking in will not be easy.\n[zoom!]\nPinkie Pie: [grunting]\n[gate creaks]\nRainbow Dash: Or it's super-easy 'cause I'm awesome.\nPinkie Pie: Go ahead! I'll catch up! You all know what to do!\n[thud]\n\nPrince Rutherford and yaks: [snoring]\n\n[montage music]\n\nPrince Rutherford: [yawns, gasps] What happened?!\nYak: Snow melted! Prince Rutherford was right!\nYaks: [cheering and laughing]\nPrince Rutherford: [laughs] Yaks tough! Yaks wait patiently! Yaks win!\nApplejack: Hoo-wee! Helpin' to fix an entire yak village sure takes a lot outta ya.\nTwilight Sparkle: Let's get out of here before\u2014\nPrince Rutherford: Oh, pink pony!\nPinkie Pie: [nervous gasping] Just play it cool! [to Prince Rutherford] We didn't help fix Yakyakistan! [nervous chuckle] No, no! We're just here for the snow sandwiches! But then we got here, and the snow was gone, so we thought we'd hit a diner on our way back to Ponyville! Bye-bye!\nPrince Rutherford: Wait. Yak not mad at pink pony.\nPinkie Pie: Yak not?\nPrince Rutherford: Pink pony help yaks without yaks asking. Means pink pony understand yaks.\nPinkie Pie: I do? Huh! I do!\nPrince Rutherford: Pink pony the best kind of friend. Officially honorary yak!\nYaks: [cheering]\nPinkie Pie: Yippee! My own honorary yak horns! Now I can officially horn-bump! Whoa!\n[thud]\nPinkie Pie: Yeah... You know, this is a little heavy for my small pony head.\nApplejack: [chuckles] Need some help with that, Pinkie Pie?\nPinkie Pie: [deep voice] Pink pony no need apple pony's help! [giggling and snorting, normally] Just kidding! Pink pony got apple pony good!\nMane Six: [laughing]\nPinkie Pie: Seriously, this is heavy.\n[thud]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[birds chirping]\nFluttershy and Discord: [laughing]\nFluttershy: Care for a carrot-ginger sandwich?\nDiscord: Oh!

What have you done?!\nDiscord: I was trying to make the tea party different and special like me. But all I did was make it chaotic and weird... like me. What if those ponies at the tea shop and the china shop were right? What if Fluttershy sees how crazy this place is and realizes how different we are? And then doesn't want to be friends anymore?! [hyperventilating]\nDiscord 2: Relax! We can fix this. Time to call in the team.\n[door opens]\nDiscord 2: Okay, chief. What's the plan?\nDiscord: What to do, what to do, what to do... Oh!\n[bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk!]\nDiscord: Got it! We know Fluttershy, and we know what she likes. First of all, we need to get rid of all the new stuff.\nDiscord 2: You heard him! Strike the new stuff!\n[poof!]\n[vacuum whirring]\n[poof!]\n[jar clinking]\n[smack!]\n[boing]\n[poof!]\nPi\u00f1ata: Bleh!\nDiscord 3: Pi\u00f1atas hate bats.\n[tea bags singing]\n[tea bag yelps]\nDiscord: Enjoy your all-expense-paid trip around Equestria!\n[poof!]\nDiscord: Well done, everybody, but there's still more work to do.\nOther Discords: [grumbling]\nDiscord: We need to make this place more Fluttershy and less, well, me.\n[poof!]\nDiscord: One thing I know about my dear friend is that she loves comfy chairs. But not on the ceiling. [snaps fingers]\n[poof!]\nDiscord: And I'm almost certain she likes stairs...\n[poof!]\nDiscord: ...that lead somewhere.\n[poof!]\n[stretch, whip!]\nDiscord: And although we've never discussed it, I'm pretty sure Fluttershy likes gravity. [snaps fingers]\n[crash!]\nDiscord: Okay, fellas! This is a good start, but stand back. Let me show you how it's done. We just need some of this. [snaps fingers]\n[poof!]\nDiscord: And a little of that. [snaps fingers]\n[poof!]\nDiscord: [snaps fingers]\n[poof!]\nOther Discords: [sounds of awe]\nDiscord: And a whole lot of those! [snaps fingers]\n[poof!]\nDiscord: [snaps fingers]\n[poof!]\nDiscord: [snaps fingers]\n[poof!]\nDiscord: Phew!\n[fan whirring]\nDiscord 2: How boring. I mean, normal.\nDiscord: Thank you!\nDiscord 2: Good job. The window treatments are perfectly unexceptional.\nDiscord: But we're not done yet.\nDiscord 2: You don't mean...\nDiscord: Mm-hmm.\nAll Discords: Makeover!\n\n[dance music]\nDiscord 2: Hating it. Hating it. Hating it. Hating... how much I love it!\n\n[scissors snipping]\n[whip!]\n[whip!]\n[bees buzzing]\nDiscord: [screams]\n\nDiscord: Okay, let's give these conversation cards a whirl. [clears throat, reading] \"It is very nice to see you today.\" \"Have you read any good books lately?\" \"Your garden looks positively lovely.\"\n\nAll Discords: [cheering]\n[poof!]\nDiscord: Huh. Quite strange. For the first time in my life, I don't feel quite strange. In fact, I feel... completely normal. Everything is finally perfect for Fluttershy.\n[clock chiming]\nDiscord: And just in time. [snaps fingers]\n[poof!]\nFluttershy: Discord! I'm so excited to finally see where you live!\nDiscord: G-Greetings, friend. Please do come in.\nFluttershy: I can't wait to see how... uh... Oh.\n[clock ticking]\nDiscord: Is something amiss?\nFluttershy: Um, no, no, not at all. It's just not what I expected. It's quite... lovely.\nDiscord: Please have a seat.\nFluttershy: Where is it?\nDiscord: Right here.\nFluttershy: Oh.\nDiscord: I think you'll be quite pleased with the green tea I've selected for us today.\nFluttershy: Oooh! Does it actually turn us green? Is it really envious of the other teas? What's it do, what's it do?!\nDiscord: Uh, well, it tastes delicious.\nFluttershy: Oh... Okay.\nDiscord: What particularly nice weather we're having.\nFluttershy: Yes... Yes, we are.\nDiscord: [sips tea] It did rain the other day, however.\nFluttershy: Uh-huh...\nDiscord: But the weather today is particularly nice. ...As I previously mentioned. Would you care for some milk toast?\nFluttershy: Uh, Discord, you don't seem to be yourself today. Are you feeling all right?\nDiscord: Whatever do you mean?\nFluttershy: Well, it's just... what you're wearing. And also what you're saying. And also the way you're saying it. And, um, pretty much everything else.\nDiscord: Oh, dear Fluttershy, worry not. I can assure you that for the first time, I'm feeling perfectly normal. Now, let me top you off.\n[clatter!]\nDiscord: Oops! Butterfingers! How embarrassing.\n[fizzle]\nFluttershy: Uh, what's going on?\nDiscord: I have... no idea.\nFluttershy: [gasps] Discord! You're starting to fade away!\nDiscord: Oh, you don't say... Have you read any good books lately? [chuckles nervously]\n\nDiscord: Huh. Have you tried the scones? They're positively delectable. The secret is in the extra butter.\nFluttershy: What is wrong with you?! You're acting so normal, which is not so normal for you!\nDiscord: Well, whatever do you mean? This is just me being me.\nFluttershy: No, it's not! It's you being like everypony else!\nDiscord: [gasps]\n[clatter]\n[fizzle]\nFluttershy: Eeeek! The more you do it, the more you fade away! Of course! You're a creature of pure chaos! Being normal is destroying you!\nDiscord: [laughs] How interesting. That reminds me of something I heard at the market today.\n[fizzle]\nFluttershy: Stop it! Please! You need to go back to being your not-normal normal self! Quick, Discord! Uh, do something chaotic before it's too late! Please!\nDiscord: Do something chaotic? I'll try...\n[squeak]\nDiscord: Ohhhh, that's not good...\nFluttershy: [whimpers] Then I guess it's up to me. [whimpers] Okay. All right. How about... [whimpering]\n[clatter]\nFluttershy: Oh, no! I tipped over that cup! That's pretty chaotic, right?\nDiscord: [yawns]\nFluttershy: [whimpers] What if I... [chomping, mouth full] Oh, my! Talking with food in my mouth after taking a bite from every sandwich! [gulps] How wacky! Doing anything for ya?\n[fizzle]\nFluttershy: [whimpers] Okay. Hmm. Maybe I need to start thinking like you. Ohhh... What would Discord do? Well, I guess he'd probably make another version of himself to bounce ideas off of.\n[clatter]\nFluttershy: But one wouldn't be enough. He'd need more! Way more!\n[zipping]\nFluttershy: [to her reflections] Hey there, Fluttershys! Any ideas on how to Discord up this tea party? [higher-pitched] Hi, Fluttershy! Thanks for asking! First of all, you gotta redecorate this place. I mean, this is where Discord lives! And you're telling me there aren't any stairs that lead to nowhere? [speaking normally] On it!\n[zipping]\n[crash]\nFluttershy: Better... but it still needs something. Now, that's more like it!\n[shimmer]\nFluttershy: [gasps] It's working! Okay, what else? Furniture on the ground? So predictable! Let's put them where they don't belong!\n[hammering, zip!, hammering]\n[shimmer]\nFluttershy: And he'd have a chaise lounge that would actually chase you! Because he's funny like that! Bet you can't catch me!\nDiscord: [chuckles lightly, snaps fingers, gasps, laughs loudly]\n[chaise lounge panting]\nFluttershy: Oh! And Discord would have a special kind of tea! Like a ginseng that could really sing!\nDiscord: I would. I-I would! [snaps fingers]\n[poof!]\n[tea bags singing]\nFluttershy: And he'd serve it on a floating table! We never talked about it, but I'm pretty sure Discord hates gravity!\nDiscord: I do! Who wants to be tethered to the ground when you can do this? [snaps fingers]\nFluttershy: [laughs] Now this is exactly what I was hoping for!\nDiscord: This is what you were hoping for? But this is the complete opposite of your tea parties.\nFluttershy: I wouldn't expect you to throw a tea party the way I would. We're different!\nDiscord: I know. I was afraid that if you saw exactly how different we are, you wouldn't want to be friends anymore.\nFluttershy: What?! Why would you ever think that?\nDiscord: Because you and I don't make sense to anypony else.\nFluttershy: That may be true, but we make sense to me. I never would've thought to make singing ginseng before I met you. But you've opened me up to so many more possibilities and impossibilities. So I guess what I'm trying to say is I like you because you're so different from me.\nDiscord: You do?\nFluttershy: Of course I do, silly! Besides, what's discord without a little chaos?\nDiscord: [chuckling] Well! In that case, I certainly don't need to be wearing this.\n[rip!]\nDiscord: Oops! [laughs] I forgot that I still had this on!\n[poof!]\nFluttershy: [giggling] Now, about that tea party...\n\nFluttershy: You know, your garden really is looking lovely.\nDiscord: Why, thank you for noticing. I also couldn't help but notice that you need a refill.\n[tea pouring]\nPi\u00f1ata: [sneezes]\nFluttershy: Gesundheit.\nDiscord: It really is nice having you here.\nFluttershy: I'm happy to be here. And I really do like your place. Because it's so you.\nDiscord: Why, thank you, Fluttershy.\nFluttershy: Now, how about we try some of those delicious-looking sandwiches?\nDiscord: [snaps fingers]\n[poof!]\nDiscord: [chuckles] You read my mind!\nFluttershy: [giggling]\n[tea bags singing]\nFluttershy and Discord: [laughing]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[ponies chattering]\nApple Bloom: Hmmm.\n[ponies continue chattering]\nApple Bloom: [gasps] Thank you! You must be new. I'm Apple Bloom.\nGrand Pear: I'm Grand Pear.\nApple Bloom: Welcome to Ponyville!\nGoldengrape: [scoffs] You mean welcome back to Ponyville. Grand Pear was originally from here before he opened his famous pear jam store in Vanhoover.\nApple Bloom: Really? Why'd ya move back?\nGrand Pear: I, uh... [smacks lips] Well, I needed a change of pace.\nApple Bloom: Huh. [chomps] This is delicious! [chomps] I can't believe I've gone my whole life without ever havin' this.\nGrand Pear: Glad you like it.\nApple Bloom: How much?\nGrand Pear: Nah.\nApple Bloom: Wow! Thanks, Mr. Grand Pear, sir! It was real nice meetin' you!\n[ponies continue chattering]\n\n[door opens]\nApplejack: Glad you're back, sugarcube. Just in time for breakfast for dinner.\nApple Bloom: I got the perfect topper for flapjacks at the market today.\nApplejack: [gasps] Pear jam?! What were you thinkin'?!\n[distant door closing]\nApplejack: Quick! Hide it!\n[wood breaking]\nApple Bloom: Huh?\n\n[theme song]\n\nApple Bloom: What's the big deal? It's just pear jam.\nApplejack: The big deal is that there is a long-standing feud between the Apples and the Pears!\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\nApple Bloom: Why?\nApplejack: Why?! ...Well, uh, a-actually, I-I'm-I'm not really sure. You have any idea, Big Mac?\nBig McIntosh: Uhhh... nope.\nApple Bloom: Then I guess we should ask Granny?\nGranny Smith: Ask me what?\n[dirt shuffling]\n[thud]\nApplejack: Uh, what goes better with apple fritter flapjacks \u2013 caramel syrup or praline!\nGranny Smith: [blows raspberry] Praline.\n[clatter]\nGranny Smith: [sniffs] Oh-ho-ho, that smells great, Applejack. I'ma go wash up for supper. Be right back.\n[door closes]\nApplejack, Apple Bloom, and Big McIntosh: [sighs]\nApplejack: Listen, sugarcube. Anytime Big Mac and I ever asked Granny about the feud or the Pears, she'd get so upset she couldn't talk. Best not bring it up.\nApple Bloom: O-Okay, but that Grand Pear was really nice to me, even though I'm an Apple. I wonder what happened.\nApplejack: Me, too. But if we can't ask Granny, I don't know who\u2014 We can ask Goldie Delicious! If anypony knows about the feud, it's the family historian!\nApple Bloom: I'm in! What do you say, Big Mac? Siblin' trip first thing tomorrow?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\n\n[knock, knock]\n[cat yowls]\n[crash!]\n[cats meowing]\nGoldie Delicious: Now, that's how you make an entrance! Or is it an exit? [laughs] Well, anyway, it's so wonderful to see you three. To what do I owe the pleasure?\nApplejack: Well, Goldie, we were hopin' you could tell us about the, uh... feud with the Apples and the Pears.\nGoldie Delicious: Oh. Oh, dear. Well, does Granny Smith know you're here?\nApple Bloom: No, ma'am. But I ran into Grand Pear yesterday, and he was real nice. Maybe the feud was a misunderstandin' or somethin', and we can fix it?\nGoldie Delicious: Oh, well, I don't know about that, little one. But if it's a story you're after, I suppose you have a right to know. Now, let's see, I got a stack of books here someplace... Oh! Apple Family History, Volume 137! Hmm, hmm... Here we are. \"Feud with the Bears\". I mean, \"Pears\". My eyes ain't what they used to be. A long time ago, Sweet Apple Acres wasn't the only farm in Ponyville. In fact, there was another one just right next door.\n\nYoung Granny Smith: Come and get your apples! Nothin' sweeter than bitin' into a crisp apple on a beautiful fall day!\nYoung Grand Pear: Unless, of course...\n[ponies gasp]\nYoung Grand Pear: ...you could bite into a juicy pear.\nYoung Granny Smith: [scoffs] Please. Pears are just what happens when you ain't no good at farmin' apples.\nYoung Grand Pear: Pears are nature's candy. Apples are sour. Like the expression on your face right now. [chuckles impishly]\nGoldie Delicious: [voiceover] And so it went. Granny and Grand Pear were always at each other on who was the best farmer or who took better care of their trees. If Granny read to her trees at night...\nYoung Granny Smith: [reading] \"And then, the little tree reached his branches up to the moon, and the moon said, 'Good night.'\"\nGoldie Delicious: [voiceover] ...why, then Grand Pear had special blankets made for his trees so they wouldn't get cold.\nYoung Grand Pear: Good night, trees. [kisses] I've got you covered. Mm-hmm.\nYoung Granny Smith: [growls]\n[book thuds]\n\n[Apple family ponies grunting]\nGoldie Delicious: [voiceover] In fact, all the Apples and the Pears were rivals to the core! The only Apple and Pear who ever got along were Bright Macintosh and Pear Butter.\nYoung Bright Macintosh: [whispering] Pssst! I'm not supposed to talk to you.\nYoung Pear Butter: [whispering] I'm not supposed to talk to you either.\nYoung Bright Macintosh: [whispering] My mom says if you hold a buttercup under your chin, it'll make your chin glow. But it doesn't work on me. See?\nYoung Pear Butter: [whispering] Does it work on me?\n[heart beating]\nYoung Bright Macintosh: It sure does, Buttercup.\nYoung Pear Butter: Buttercup. I like that name.\nApplejack: [voiceover] Wait an apple-pickin' minute!\n\nApplejack: Bright Mac and Buttercup? Those are our parents' names!\nGoldie Delicious: Of course Buttercup was just a nickname your father gave your mother. Pear Butter \u2013 well, that was her given name.\nApplejack: Are you sayin' our mother was a... Pear?!\nApple Bloom and Big McIntosh: [deep gasp]\n\nBig McIntosh: So we are half-Pear?!\nApplejack: I can't believe it! How did we not know?!\nGoldie Delicious: Well, uh, nopony called your mother Pear Butter.\n[cats meowing]\nGoldie Delicious: And her cutie mark was a preserve jar, but pear butter don't look too much different from apple butter, so no clues there.\nApplejack: [sighs] Is there a-anythin' else you can tell us about them?\nGoldie Delicious: I know they loved each other very much. They had that magical, star-kissed, other-side-of-a-rainbow kind of love. You couldn't be around them too long and, and not feel a little bit lighter than air yourself. [chuckling]\nApple Bloom: Anything else?\nGoldie Delicious: Hmm... I'd need Volume 138 for that.\n[cheetah grunts]\nGoldie Delicious: I'm sure I could wrangle it... in a, in a couple of days.\nApplejack: [sighs] That's all right, Goldie. It was... nice just to hear\u2014\nGoldie Delicious: Ooh-hoo-hoo! I just remembered somethin'! Your dad and his buddy Burnt Oak would get in all kinds of trouble together as colts.\nApplejack: Burnt Oak? The firewood salespony? I haven't seen him in ages.\nGoldie Delicious: He and your dad were thick as thieves back in the day. Y'all should talk to him.\n[thud]\n[cheetah grunts]\n\nBurnt Oak: Well, well, if it isn't the Apples. What can I do for ya? I know you're not here for firewood. You got more trees than anypony in Ponyville.\nApplejack: You're right. We're not here for that.\nBurnt Oak: Come to ask about your dad?\nBig McIntosh: Uh, eeyup.\nBurnt Oak: I wondered if you might. Hoped you would. It's nice to talk about him. [laughs] We had a lot of laughs. In fact, this one time...\n\nBurnt Oak: [voiceover] ...we were racin' to see who could till the fastest, and Bright Mac was leavin' me in the dust. He would've won, too, if he wasn't so... distracted.\nBright Mac: Whoa!\n[crash]\n[splash]\nPear Butter: [spits]\nGrand Pear: Oh!\n[splash]\nGrand Pear: Pear Butter, what did you do?!\nPear Butter: I-I'm not sure.\nBright Mac: She didn't do it, sir.\nGrand Pear: Excuse me?\nBright Mac: The water silo. It was my fault.\nPear Butter: [giggles]\nGrand Pear: [snorts] You owe me a new silo, boy! [to Pear Butter] And you, come with me. No daughter of mine is gonna make goo-goo eyes at an Apple!\n\nBurnt Oak: Grand Pear never would've known it was your father's fault. But there was no way he'd let your mother take the blame for somethin' he did.\nApple Bloom: So Dad was super honest! Apple doesn't fall far from the tree, huh, Applejack?\n[thunk]\nBurnt Oak: Your dad worked the Apple farm all day and then headed over to the Pears on his breaks to fix the water silo. I didn't see him for weeks! Not that he minded. Gave him a chance to get to know your mom.\nApple Bloom: Did you know our mom, too?\nBurnt Oak: Buttercup was a real peach of a Pear. But if you want to know more about her, you should ask Mrs. Cake.\nApple Bloom: Mrs. Cake?\nBurnt Oak: She and your mom were inseparable when they were fillies.\nApplejack: Then let's go! Thanks, Burnt Oak!\nBig McIntosh: Uh, would it be okay if we stopped by again sometime to hear more stories?\nBurnt Oak: I'd like that very much.\n\n[the Cakes' theme playing]\n[door opens]\nMrs. Cake: Well, cinnamon sugar on toast! All three Apple siblings!\nApplejack: Hi, Mrs. Cake. We heard you and our ma used to be real good friends, and we were hopin' you could tell us a bit about her.\nMrs. Cake: Oh, I would love to. I never knew the right time to bring it up. But I'm so glad you came! [laughs] Uh, for starters, did you all know that it was your mom who convinced me to pursue baking?\nApple Bloom: But isn't your name Mrs. Cake?\nMrs. Cake: Not always. Back when I was Chiffon Swirl, heh, I had no idea what I was supposed to do. But one day, your mom brought me some candied pears, eggs, flour, sugar, and vanilla, and told me to just be creative! Next thing I knew, I was whipping up pear upside-down cake, and I got my cutie mark! It was like she knew what I was supposed to do long before I did.\nApplejack: [to Apple Bloom] Just like you, sugarcube! Or rather, you're just like her!\nMrs. Cake: That was the first of many cakes for me, and Buttercup was with me through it all.\n\nMrs. Cake: [voiceover] She'd be my taste-tester, help with the decorating, and prep new ingredients. Over the years, I perfected my recipes. Your mom did so much for me. One day, I wanted to surprise her with a cake.\nBright Mac and Pear Butter: [laughing]\nBright Mac: [sniffs] Achoo!\nPear Butter: [blows, giggles]\nBright Mac and Pear Butter: [laughing]\n[twig snaps]\nPear Butter: [gasps] Oh. It's just you.\nChiffon Swirl: Sorry. I just brought you a little something to say thank you. But I see you're busy. Hah.\nPear Butter: [giggles] Promise you won't say anything?\n[bush rustles]\nGranny Smith: [whinny, snort] What in tarnation are you doin', Bright Mac?! We do not fraternize with Pears! [spits]\nChiffon Swirl: You and Bright Mac? Whew, I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. Your families hate each other.\nPear Butter: I can't help it. We just sorta... happened.\nMrs. Cake: [voiceover] Then Pear Butter told me the sweetest love story I have ever heard.\n\nBright Mac: Happy one hundred and thirty-one thousand, four hundred and fifty-six hour anniversary, darlin'.\nPear Butter: What? [laughs] That's way longer than we've been together.\nBright Mac: I know, but it's the anniversary of the first time I called you \"Buttercup\". It's okay if you didn't get me anythin'.\nPear Butter: Actually... I did.\nBright Mac: A guitar? For me? But... [strums guitar] I don't know how to play.\nPear Butter: Quiet, you.\n\n[Pear Butter]\nWe're far apart in every way\nBut you're the best part of my day\nAnd sure as I breathe the air\nI know we are the perfect pair\n\nWe're far apart in every way\nBut you're the best part of my day\nAnd sure as I breathe the air\nI know we are the perfect pair\n\nOn a prickly path that goes on for miles\nBut it's worth it just to see you smile\n\nOn a prickly path that goes on for miles\nBut it's worth it just to see you smile\n\nAnd I cannot be pulled apart\nFrom the hold you have on my heart\nAnd even if the world tells us it's wrong\nYou're in my head like a catchy song\n\nAnd I cannot be pulled apart\nFrom the hold you have on my heart\nAnd even if the world tells us it's wrong\nYou're in my head like a catchy song\n\nBright Mac: Wow. It's just... wow.\nPear Butter: Do you like it? Be honest now.\nBright Mac: It's the best gift you could've given me!\n\n[Pear Butter]\nThe seasons change and leaves may fall\nBut I'll be with you through them all\nAnd rain or shine, you'll always be mine\n\nThe seasons change and leaves may fall\nBut I'll be with you through them all\nAnd rain or shine, you'll always be mine\n\nOn a prickly path that goes on for miles\nYou're the only one who makes it all worthwhile\n\nOn a prickly path that goes on for miles\nYou're the only one who makes it all worthwhile\n\nAnd you should not blame me, too\nIf I can't help fallin' in love with you...\nBright Mac: Hey, no fair. I was gonna tell you the same thing.\nPear Butter: You're just mad I beat you to it.\nBright Mac: I'm tellin' ya, I was gonna pull you up, cover your eyes, lead you over here... and say, \"Surprise!\" And then you'd say, [imitating Pear Butter] \"Oh, Bright Mac, I love it!\" [speaking normally] And then I'd say I love you. Too bad it didn't work out though.\nPear Butter: Eeyup. Too bad.\n\nAnd you should not blame me, too\nIf I can't help fallin' in love with you...\n\n[paper ripping]\nGrand Pear: The Pears are moving!\nPear Butter: [deep gasp]\n\nApplejack, Apple Bloom, and Big McIntosh: [deep gasp]\n\nApplejack: I mean, I figured the Pears moved, but I didn't know all that stuff happened before with Granny and Grand Pear.\nApple Bloom: It must've been really hard on our parents.\nMrs. Cake: Oh, it was.\n\nPear Butter: We're moving?! To Vanhoover?! But that's so far!\nGrand Pear: It's what's best. There's acres of untouched land and a warehouse to make our jams. We'll get to expand our business and get away from those gosh-darned Apples.\nMrs. Cake: [voiceover] Pear Butter was devastated. But seeing no way out of it, she did what she had to do.\n\nBright Mac: So that's it?\nPear Butter: What do you want me to do, Bright Mac? We're movin'. I love you, but [tearing up] I have to stay with my family.\nMrs. Cake: [voiceover] Then Bright Mac did the most romantic thing I've ever seen anypony do.\n\nApple Bloom: What?! What?!\nApplejack: [simultaneous] What?! What did he do?!\nBig McIntosh: [simultaneous] Tell us! Tell us!\nMrs. Cake: We're gonna need one more pony to tell that story.\n\nApple Bloom: Mayor Mare, you knew our parents?\nMayor Mare: Not as well as Mrs. Cake, but I did play a part in their love story. The night before the Pear family moved, Bright Mac asked me to meet him at the edge of Sweet Apple Acres.\n\nPear Butter: [gasps]\nBright Mac: I don't want to be apart from you. Ever. I'm not sure what we'll do, but I'm sure of us. So sure that I'd marry you today.\nPear Butter: I would, too!\nYoung Mayor Mare: I think that's my cue.\nMayor Mare: [voiceover] I had the honor of officiating your parents' secret wedding, and it was perfect. Bright Mac knew Buttercup wouldn't want a big splash.\nApple Bloom: [voiceover] Reminds me of somepony else I know.\nBig McIntosh: [voiceover, chuckling] Eeyup.\nMayor Mare: [voiceover] So they had a special way to seal their vows.\nYoung Mayor Mare: I now pronounce you\u2014\nGranny Smith: What is goin' on?! What's with all these here candles?!\nGrand Pear: Pear Butter! Where are ya? You're supposed to be packing! [grimly] What are you two doing?\nBright Mac: Ma, Grand Pear, Buttercup and I are in love!\nGranny Smith and Grand Pear: What?!\nPear Butter: And we'll be married as soon as Mayor Mare says...\nYoung Mayor Mare: Oh! [quickly] I now pronounce you husband and wife!\nPear Butter: Doesn't that feel nice? [kisses]\nBright Mac and Pear Butter: [kissing]\nGranny Smith: What are you talking about, married?! You two can't be married!\nGrand Pear: Finally, something we can agree on. Pear Butter, enough of this nonsense. We're movin'! And you gotta stick with your family!\nPear Butter: But... the Apples are my family now, too.\nGrand Pear: You can't be serious. Are you choosin' to be an Apple over being a Pear?!\nPear Butter: Are you makin' me choose?\nGrand Pear: Yes. I am.\nPear Butter: Then yeah. I guess I am.\nGrand Pear: Fine!\nPear Butter: [sobbing]\n\nApplejack: I can't believe Grand Pear just up and left Ma like that! No wonder Granny never told us about any of this.\nMrs. Cake: These things are never easy.\nMayor Mare: And it's hard to know when it is a good time.\nApplejack: It seems to me that now's as good a time as any.\nApple Bloom: To talk to both our grandparents.\n\nApple Bloom: Excuse me? Grand Pear?\nApplejack: I'm Applejack, and this here's Big McIntosh. But you already know who we are, don't ya?\nGrand Pear: Sure do.\nApple Bloom: Did you really move to Ponyville just for a change of pace?\nGrand Pear: No.\nApple Bloom: Then you came here because you're sorry and that you wanted to get to know us, too?\nGrand Pear: I'm... so sorry. I-I-I was just so angry, and... well, I-I never...\nApple Bloom: It's in the past, Grand Pear. Oh! Can I call you Grandpere Pear?\nGrand Pear: [chuckles] Sure can.\n\nGranny Smith: Now where'd you all get to? I ain't seen hide or hair of ya's all day.\nApplejack: We've been all over. Learnin' about our parents.\nGranny Smith: Guh... Y-You have?\nApplejack: And our grandfather.\nGranny Smith: So... you're back, huh?\nGrand Pear: Sure am. [mumbling] Never should've left.\nApple Bloom: Findin' you and learnin' all about Mom and Dad, I feel like I found a piece of me I didn't even know was missin'.\nApplejack: Hearin' their story makes me feel closer to them somehow.\nGranny Smith: I'm sorry. I should've told you all about 'em sooner.\nGrand Pear: And I should've been here. Ah, I can't believe I let a silly feud keep me from my family.\nApplejack: Nothing's keepin' ya from us now.

[laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmmm. That sounds familiar. [gasps]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [humming and hmm-ing] No... Aha! Here it is.\nStarlight Glimmer: What is that?\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on, Starlight, don't judge a book by its cover. This is the friendship journal my friends and I used to keep. It's filled with all the things we've learned, like: \"Friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt, it's worth fighting for.\"\n[paper rustling]\nStarlight Glimmer: I'll judge a book by its cover just this once.\nTwilight Sparkle: [grumbles]\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks for coming, everypony. I've got a surprise for you.\nFluttershy: What is it, Twilight? Do I need to prepare myself?\nTwilight Sparkle: It's this!\n[magic zap]\nRarity: Ugh, what is that thing? Why is it so smelly?\nPinkie Pie: Wait a minute. [gasps] Is this our old friendship journal? I haven't seen this thing in forever!\nApplejack: Hoo-wee! It's lookin' a little, uh... overripe.\nRainbow Dash: I'll say!\n[pages turning]\nRainbow Dash: There's a smushed apple in Applejack's lessons.\n[page turns]\nRainbow Dash: Fluttershy's lessons are so small, you can barely read them.\nFluttershy: I, uh, wanted to leave room for all of you.\n[pages turning]\nRainbow Dash: I-I don't even know what this is.\nRarity: It is called calligraphy, darling. If you're going to make words, at least make them fabulous.\n[page unfolding]\nApplejack: Looks like you got a little aggressive with your friendship lessons, Rainbow Dash.\nRainbow Dash: What can I say? When I learn something, I learn it hard.\n[confetti explodes]\nRainbow Dash: [unimpressed] I found Pinkie's page.\nPinkie Pie: [giggles] Well, I am surprised!\nTwilight Sparkle: That wasn't the only surprise.\n[magic zap]\n[pages rustling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ta-da! Starlight and I decided to make one for each of you!\nApplejack: That's amazin'! A perfect copy!\nStarlight Glimmer: I learned the spell years ago when I needed to make copies of a certain\u2014 [long pause] [clears throat] ...manifesto.\nRarity: [sniffs] Ahhh! Even better than a perfect copy.\nFluttershy: Oh, I'd forgotten all about this lesson.\nRainbow Dash: [laughing] Remember this one from when I helped Daring Do? \"Never underestimate the power of friends who always got your back.\"\nPinkie Pie: Aww, Cheese Sandwich! Party cannon! Ah! Birth-iversary!\nStarlight Glimmer: After Twilight remembered the journal, I had so much fun reading all the stuff you've all learned, I just had to have my own copy.\nTwilight Sparkle: And that brings me to the second part of the surprise. My idea. How would you girls feel about making our journal available for everypony? If we can get these lessons into other ponies' hooves, maybe they'll benefit from them.\nFluttershy: Well, I think that's a great idea.\nPinkie Pie: I'm in! Yay!\nApplejack: W-We always said we wanted to.\nRarity: Sounds fabulous.\nRainbow Dash: [laughing] I'm awesome.\n[pause]\nRainbow Dash: Oh, yeah. Uh, good idea.\n\n[montage music]\n\n[foals chattering]\nToola Roola: No! I don't wanna play with you anymore!\nCoconut Cream: Why not?! You love playing hopskotch!\nToola Roola: No, you do because you always win!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey, girls. Couldn't help but overhear. You might want to take a breather, maybe read Rainbow Dash's chapter on Rainbow Falls? It might help.\nToola Roola: Sure, Princess.\nApple Bloom: Thanks, Twilight! The friendship journal's makin' us super popular!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh.\nApple Bloom: We were thinkin' of puttin' together a cutie mark summer camp. Now, everypony's definitely gonna sign up for it! This is gonna be awesome! [laughs] Cutie Mark Crusaders, whoo.\nStarlight Glimmer: A cutie mark camp is a great idea.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah, but the purpose of the journal isn't supposed to be marketing.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I just hope those foals actually learn something from our lessons.\nStarlight Glimmer: They will! I'm sure ponies all across Equestria will\u2014 Whoa!\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, hello! Can I... help you?\nOut of Town Pony: We're here all the way from Fillydelphia because we got copies of your friendship journal!\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow! How wonderful! What was your favorite friendship\u2014\nOut of Town Pony: Will you sign them?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, uh, I guess so. So, what did you think of the lessons?\nOut of Town Pony: Oh, we haven't read them. These are keepsakes. We gotta keep them in mint condition. Ha-ha.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh.\nOut of Town Pony 2: Wow, that was worth the trip!\n[visiting ponies chattering excitedly]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure lots of other ponies are being inspired to be better friends.\nDiamond Cutter: Well, I for one found the journal terribly illuminating.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\nLavender Bloom: I agree. I'm seeing sides of these ponies I didn't know were there. I only wish they'd left Rarity out. She clearly doesn't belong in that book with the rest of them.\nDiamond Cutter: Oh, I know! Who does she think she is? Certainly she did a fine job setting up the Ponyville Days celebration, but does she really believe it was a success just because of her? [inconsiderate laughter] The nerve!\n[paper rustling]\nRarity: [bawling]\nTwilight Sparkle: But that's not what she was saying! Rarity!\n\nRarity: [crying]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, poor Rarity. She overheard all the mean things those ponies were saying. She must be devastated. I'm going after her.\nStarlight Glimmer: Go ahead. I'm gonna have a chat with these two.\n\nRarity: [crying]\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity, wait!\n[smack]\nPinkie Pie: Twilight! Isn't it amazing? Our journals are everywhere!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie, I've got to\u2014\nPinkie Pie: Ponies keep stopping by to tell me my entries are hilarious!\n[scribbling]\nPinkie Pie: I even had somepony come all the way from Las Pegasus to say how much he liked my lessons!\nTwilight Sparkle: I am so glad to hear some ponies are being inspired by the journal.\nCherry Berry: Hey, look! There's Pinkie Pie! The funny one!\n[ponies laughing]\nPinkie Pie: Giggly feedback is the best kind!\n[ponies laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, at least you're getting a positive reaction. I just saw Rarity, and I'm afraid this whole journal thing really upset her.\nPinkie Pie: Aww, that's too bad.\n[ponies laughing]\nPinkie Pie: Wait. That wasn't even funny.\n[ponies laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: O-kay. Well, I guess I'll catch you later.\n[beat]\nCherry Berry: [coughs]\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\nPinkie Pie: Yup. Bye, Twilight!\n[ponies laughing]\nSassaflash: Hah! Classic Pinkie! Oh, she's even funnier in real life!\nPinkie Pie: You've known me for years!\n[ponies laughing]\n\n[pages rustling]\nRainbow Dash: Maybe it's time to call it a day.\n\"Princess Erroria\": I wipped out all the Twilight Spawkle lessons 'cause they were getting in the way of the good ones.\nTwilight Sparkle: What do you mean you skipped the lessons? We've all had valuable experiences.\nRainbow Dash: Hey, here's a great idea! Why don't you guys talk to Twilight for a while? So I can get back to things like working and napping and, well, pretty much anything else.\n\"Princess Erroria\": Aw, we don't wanna hear her bowing lessons! Come on! Tell us again about when you met Dawing Do!\nRainbow Dash: [laughs nervously] Again? Haven't we already covered that one? A couple dozen times?\n\"Princess Erroria\": We can't get enough of it! Come on, you don't want to disappoint your fans!\nRainbow Dash: Uh... It's just that I, uh, really need to get those storm clouds back in their... pens.\n\"Princess Erroria\": Oh, cool! We'll come along. You can tell us the stowy there.\nPegasus Fillies: Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!\n\n[ponies chattering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, what's going on now?\nFluttershy: Please, just leave me alone!\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy, what's wrong?\nGlasses Stallion: We want answers!\n\"Lemon Chiffon\": Yeah! We're entitled to know!\nTwilight Sparkle: What is it, everypony?\n\"Lemon Chiffon\": We wanna know why Fluttershy keeps learning the same thing over and over again! Be assertive already!\n\"Wisp\": Even I've learned more than she has! Why can't I be in the book?!\nStarlight Glimmer: What? Really?! Are you attacking my friend because you want to be in a book?!\nFluttershy: It's okay. I got this, girls. [inhales] Listen up! I am more assertive! And yes, it took me a while to get there. But can you honestly say that you could learn something one time and completely change who you are? [beat] I didn't think so.\nGlasses Stallion: Wow. You're way different from the Fluttershy in the book. I don't know how I feel about that.\nFluttershy: [sighs]\n[ponies chattering]\nTwilight Sparkle: It feels like everypony in Equestria is missing the \"friendship\" part of the friendship journals.\n\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity, are you alright?

[frustrated noises]\nTwilight Sparkle: Stress-sewing?\nRarity: When I overheard those two at the cafe, I suddenly understood why I've been getting cancellations for days!\nStarlight Glimmer: What? Why are ponies cancelling their orders?\n[squeak]\nRarity: Because nopony likes me any more! They're boycotting me! [grunts]\n[ponies chattering]\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sure if I go out there and talk to those ponies, they'll see that they're being unreasonable.\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: [yelps]\nApplejack: [panting] I need a hundred blankets, and I need 'em now! Sorry, Twilight.\nRarity: Right away, pony-who-still-likes-me!\nApplejack: I don't need nothin' fancy.\nTwilight Sparkle: What's the matter, Applejack?\nApplejack: I'm popular, Twilight! I'm popular, and I don't like it one bit!\nStarlight Glimmer: You go ahead. I'll stay here.\nTwilight Sparkle: [inhales and exhales]\n[sewing machine whirr]\n\n[loud pony chattering]\n[squeaking]\nApple Bloom: [frustrated groan]\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack, who are all these ponies?\nApplejack: They call themselves the Sweet Apple Admirers. They say they read my journal entries, and they felt like a part of the family. And now they actually wanna become part of the family!\n[camera flashes]\nTwilight Sparkle: Your journal entries?\nApplejack: Yeah, you know, all the stuff about how friends are like family and whatnot?\nTwilight Sparkle: Can't you get rid of them?\nApplejack: And kick out my own family?! Granny Smith, hang on! Let me help!\nSweet Apple Admirer: There she is!\nPonies: Yee-haw!\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] I wish we'd never released that journal.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: There you are! Okay, I just left Rarity. I think she's doing better, and\u2014 Oh, boy. Window-staring, huh? Was it that bad at Sweet Apple Acres?\nTwilight Sparkle: It's bad everywhere. I thought I was doing something good. I thought I was helping. How could our friendship journal have led to so much... anti-friendship?!\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, Twilight, it's not your fault.\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course it's my fault! If I hadn't had the big idea to make copies, none of this would be happening! I'm afraid I made life awful for my friends!\nStarlight Glimmer: I really think you're being too hard on yourself.\nTwilight Sparkle: Am I?!\n[knocking]\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: [yelps]\n[loud chattering]\n[doors slam]\n[crunch]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\nApplejack: I didn't know where else to go! I've got so much cookin' and cleanin' and family-in' to do... I ain't got time for anythin' else!\nPinkie Pie: At least ponies aren't laughing every time you talk! Not even I want to be funny all the time! I'm telling you, my days of hilariosity-ness-ness are over!\nRainbow Dash: You think you've got problems? I know I'm awesome, but I can't even go to the bathroom without somepony trying to tell me how cool I am! [beat] Uh, Rarity? What are you wearing?\nRarity: My emotions, darling! Stress couture!\nFluttershy: I don't know what I'm gonna do if I have to defend myself one more time!\nRarity: Hmm? Oh, uh, sorry, darling. Force of habit.\n[curtain drawing]\n[loud muffled chatter]\nApplejack: [snoring]\n[pop]\n[crunch]\nStarlight Glimmer: Okay, so maybe they are having a hard time with it. That doesn't mean you did anything wrong.\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, I did! Releasing the journal was my idea, and it backfired in ways I could never have imagined!\nStarlight Glimmer: It's not your fault. It's everypony else's! They're just focusing on the wrong things, and\u2014 [gasps] Wait here! I've got an idea!\n[magic zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't wait any longer. I've got to fix this.\n[ponies arguing loudly]\n[doors open]\nTwilight Sparkle: Everypony, please stop!\n[ponies arguing loudly]\nReporter Pony: Princess Twilight, I'm with the Canterlot Chronicle. Quick question \u2014 what would you say to ponies who wonder why you moved to Ponyville in the first place?\nTwilight Sparkle: I moved here to learn about friendship. That's why the journal even exists. It took some time for me to get the hang of it, but it was each of these ponies standing next to me who taught me the lessons in those journals. Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Fluttershy, too. Then it was all of you. I've learned so much from\u2014\nReporter Pony: What I mean is, some ponies would argue that it doesn't seem believable that the six of you would be friends.\nTwilight Sparkle: \"Believable\"?\nReporter Pony: Well, sure. I read this journal cover to cover, and I have to say your character would have been much more interesting if she'd stayed in Canterlot.\nTwilight Sparkle: My character?! We are real ponies! This journal is a record of things that actually happened to us! We made mistakes, and we learned from them!\nDiamond Cutter: What about Rarity? Are we really supposed to believe she learned anything she wrote in there?\n\"Princess Erroria\": That's why you wanna be Team Dash! She's the only one that didn't weally need to learn anything, because she was alweady so cool.\nPearly Stitch: Twilight was better before she got wings!\n\"Lemon Chiffon\": Fluttershy is just so painfully shy, it's hard to relate!

In fact, I wrote them down.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] You've been hanging around Twilight for too long.\nTwilight Sparkle: [chuckles nervously]\nSpike: Reason number one \u2013 I invited Dragon Lord Ember to Ponyville today. Reason two \u2013 the Dragon Lord is a dragon. Reason three \u2013 she's coming here to learn more about friendship.\nTwilight Sparkle: According to Ember's letters, the dragons are trying to be friends, but competing is in their nature, and it's leading to more and more fights.\nSpike: Which brings me to to reason number four. The Dragon Lord wants my advice, and as the new official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons, I can't let her down.\nTwilight Sparkle: I know you feel a lot of pressure, but you've got this, Spike!\nSpike: I...

Hey, Twilight! [chuckles, gasps] Glowing map... [gulps] Glowing spikes... That's not good.\nSpike: I know!\nStarlight Glimmer: At least your friendship problem is in Ponyville? Heh.\nSpike: Okay, okay. To pull this off, I'm gonna need both of you to help. You two need to keep Ember and Thorax separate while I get ice cream.\nTwilight Sparkle: You mean \"find the friendship problem\".\nSpike: Yeeeees! Go easy on me. I'm under a lot of pressure.\n\nSpike: Friendship problem? Anypony gotta friendship problem here? Any problems to solve? Friendship problems? Friendship problems! Anypony got a friendship problem here? No? Okay.\nLyra Heartstrings: [grunts] Well, I think vanilla strawberry cream is overused!\nSweetie Drops: Hmph.\nSpike: Yes! Fighting! Uh, I mean, what seems to be the problem?\n\nEmber: Mmm. Mmm. I'm stuffed. [belches]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ember, there you are!\nEmber: Okay, right. More pony hugs.\nTwilight Sparkle: How's your trip to Ponyville so far?\nEmber: Well, I'm certainly learning a lot about friendship. I had no idea it was polite to decorate your walls in your friends' favorite foods!\nTwilight Sparkle: [laughs nervously] Oh, my.\nEmber: Where'd Spike and Starlight go? I feel like I'm being avoided. [snorts]\nTwilight Sparkle: Nooooo. They're just making sure everything is perfect for your welcome party later. In the meantime, how about I show you around town?\nEmber: Sounds good. I can't exactly learn about friendship if I don't make new friends.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\n\nThorax: [grunting, sighs]\n[door closes]\nThorax: Oh!\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, hey, Thorax. Um, Twilight and Spike had some boring official paperwork to deal with, so looks like you and I get to hang out. What would you like to do?\nThorax: But I wanted to talk with Spike. He said he'd be right back.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, you will. But first, how about we grab a bite to eat?\nThorax: Huh. Well, you know, now that you've said it, I am a little hungry. Is there a dining room in the castle?\nStarlight Glimmer: No! I mean, yeah, but that's castle food. If you want the good stuff, we gotta go to town. Phew!\n\nSpike: ...and that's why you should never let cupcake flavors get in the way of your friendship.\nLyra Heartstrings: Huh. I guess I never thought of it that way. Thanks, Spike!\nSpike: Oh, come on! Glow!\nThorax: Spike! There you are! Uh, done with your boring paperwork, I see.\nStarlight Glimmer: [laughs nervously] Uh-huh. Uh-huh.\nSpike: Yep. [laughs] I am done with whatever Starlight says I was doing.\nStarlight Glimmer: Thorax wanted to get out of the castle. I thought coming to town was a really, really great idea.\nThorax: Well, maybe now we can talk.\nSpike: Uh, sssssure.\nStarlight Glimmer: I'll leave you guys to it.\nThorax: First of all, I want to say thank you for having me over. I'm in a bit of a leadership pickle, and I could use some advice.\nSpike: Well, I definitely want to help you out as quickly as possible.\nThorax: Here's my problem. There's this renegade group of changelings who still feed off of love. Even though I said, \"Hey let's not do that anymore,\" they say, \"Hey, this is how we've been doing things for hundreds of years...\" [crossfades] ...but it's like they don't want to, even though I'm the leader and I have to... [fades out]\n\n[ponies sounding interested]\nEmber: Hello, I am Ember, daughter of Torch, winner of the Gauntlet of Fire, and lord of all dragons! [roars]\n[ponies scream]\nEmber: Usually when I do that, the dragons are eager to meet me.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's not how ponies make friends.\nEmber: Ah, I get it.\nDerpy: [slurps]\nEmber: This is a weird friendship thing you ponies do, right?\n[splat]\n[honk!]\n[beat]\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, you guys are in town, too?\nEmber: What are you talking about? You've been with me this whole time.\nStarlight Glimmer: No. I'm Starlight.\n[beat]\nEmber: Riiiight. I'm sorry, but you can't blame me. You both look and act so much alike.\nTwilight Sparkle and Starlight Glimmer: What?!\n\nThorax: ...and they said to me they just keep saying the same thing. You know, I think my leadership problem started in childhood. I must've been three when... [crossfades] ...three's a different story, a-and you've definitely gotta hear it. But the story about my brother was when I was two... or was I one?\nCrusoe Palm: This is my seat! I saw it first!\n\"Rainbow Stars\": Well, I got here first!\nSpike: Thorax, uh, excuse me for a second.\nCrusoe Palm and \"Rainbow Stars\": [growl]\nSpike: Ponies, please! If I may, I think I can help solve this friendship problem. You two should sit together. You both like the same place, you both ordered muffins, you're both ponies. I think if you made a little effort, you'd find\u2014 Whoa! Okay, that had to have done it. Come on, spikes. Glow! [strains, sighs]\nThorax: Hey, that was really great advice. So what do you think I should do?\nSpike: [gasps] Uh, actually, I, uh... need a minute... alone... to, uh, really come up with great advice! [pants] I'll be right back.\nThorax: [sighs] Great. No problem. Leave me again. It's fine.\n\nEmber: I'm just saying you're both purple ponies with purple hair. You both have cutie marks with sparkly things.\nStarlight Glimmer: [chuckles] Mine's more of a glimmer. Heh.\nEmber: How is that different? Oh, good. Spike. Can you please tell these two I'm right? They look very similar.\nSpike: Uh... Well, y'know, one thing friends do is let something go when it's upsetting somepony else.\nEmber: But I'm right! Besides, who are you to be telling me about friendship? I've barely seen you all day!\nSpike: Uh, well, I've seen you.\nEmber: Are you calling me a liar?!\nSpike: [chatters]\nThorax: Hey! No one yells at my friend!\n[transformation noise]\nThorax: [bear growl]\nEmber: Spike, get away from the bear!\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, the bear is a changeling. And he's quite gentle.\nThorax: Not anymore! [bear roar]\nEmber: [roars]\nThorax: [bear growl]\nSpike: [screams] My worst fears are happening!\n\nSpike: Noooo!\nThorax: [pants] Back away, Spike! I'm not gonna let this dragon harm a scale on your back!\nEmber: You back away! I'm not gonna let you harm him! Wait. Did you say you're not gonna let me harm Spike?\nThorax: Yeah!\nEmber: But that's what I'm doing!\nThorax: Uh, what?\nEmber: Yeah, what?\nSpike: [panicked] Equestria as we know it is over! The war that pits changeling against dragon is about to begin! And it's all my fault! My title of Equestria's friendship ambassador is a lie\u2014! Oh. Hey. You guys aren't fighting?\nEmber: Why would we be fighting?\nSpike: Because I accidentally invited you both over to Ponyville on the same day?\nEmber and Thorax: So what?\nSpike: So I... was trying to keep you apart because I didn't think you'd get along.\nEmber: Oh. I get it. You thought he wouldn't like me just because I'm a dragon and I'm bad at friendship?\nSpike: No, no, of course not! But\u2014 Wait. Isn't that why you're here?\nEmber: I can say I'm bad at friendship. You can't say it about me! You know what? I don't wanna talk about it.\nSpike: Wait, please! [sighs] [to Thorax] I'm sorry.\nThorax: No, no, it's cool. You thought I would be too soft, and someone like Ember would never respect me. Just like my own changelings!\nSpike: No, that's not it! Thorax, wait! Oh, no... What have I done?\n\n[splash]\n[kick]\n[splash]\nEmber: Why are you still here?\nThorax: [sighs] Because I'm having trouble leading my pack, so I don't really wanna go home.\nEmber: Wait, you're in charge? [chuckles] Oh, boy. You need to be more assertive.\nThorax: Well, that's my problem. I don't know how! I tried asking them to please follow my directions. I even offered a prize, and then\u2014\nEmber: Shhh! Stop talking.\n[beat]\nEmber: That's how you do it.\nThorax: Whoa! That just gave me chills.\nEmber: I know you have it in you. You turned into a bear to defend Spike.\nThorax: Huh, I guess I can be tough when I'm defending my friends, but when I'm just enforcing my rules, I-I feel unsure of myself.\nEmber: There's nothing to be unsure of. You're the leader for a reason. Make a decision and let it be known that the decision is final. And if that doesn't work, turn into a bear.\nThorax: Oh, well, that's good advice.\nEmber: I know it is.\nThorax: So what's your deal? Why do you think you're so bad at friendship?\nEmber: I don't want to talk about it.\nThorax: Oh, you have to! How else are you gonna solve your problems?\nEmber: Through feats of strength and fire duels, of course. [grunts, roars]\n[explosion]\nThorax: Uh, how does that help?\n[crunch]\nEmber: Crushing another dragon in competition establishes my dominance and makes me feel great.\nThorax: Right, but, uh, how do you think they feel?\nEmber: Humiliated! Ashamed! They'd probably wanna run away and bury themselves under a rock and... never come out. They're probably sad. Kinda low. Definitely not happy.\nThorax: That's because that kind of competition can divide you. And it doesn't get to the heart of the issue. Talking about your feelings does.\nEmber: [sneezes] Ugh! I think I'm allergic to feelings.\nThorax: You know you don't have to be sappy...\nEmber: [blows]\nThorax: ...or huggy-feely about it! But you should let your friends know how you feel.\nEmber: Uh, I know where we can start.\n[whoosh]\nThorax: Where? Ohhhh. Spike. Hah. I got there.\n\nSpike: I think they're gone. They probably never want to see me again.\n[thuds]\nStarlight Glimmer: Or they want to see you now.\nSpike: [gulps]\nEmber: Guess what, Spike.\nSpike: I know. I'm so sorry.\nEmber: Let me talk about this! I... feel... [strains] mad. [sighs]\nThorax: Okaaaay... That's a good first attempt. Now maybe try to be more specific?\nEmber: [cracks limbs, breathes deeply] I'm... [sighs] upset!\nSpike: You have every right to be.\nEmber: I know I do! And I know I need to tell you how I feel because my friend Thorax said it would make me feel better. And it does!\nThorax: Yeah! And I have no problem telling you what you did was wrong because my friend Ember is helping me be more assertive!\n[thud]\nSpike: Whoa.\nEmber: Nice.\nEmber and Thorax: Ha-ha!\nSpike: You guys should be mad at me. I was so worried about how it could go wrong, I didn't even think about how it could go right. [sighs] Can you forgive me?\nEmber: I really do feel better. So, yeah. I'm good.\nThorax: Hah. Me, too. [pleased sounds]\nEmber: [groans] Again?\nSpike: [laughing]\n[spikes shimmering]\nSpike: No way! It's finally happening! I solved the friendship problem!\nStarlight Glimmer: Actually, you created the friendship problem by not trusting your friends.\nSpike: Yeah, but then I solved it by learning my lesson. I should have told my two friends about each other immediately instead of assuming they wouldn't get along.\nTwilight Sparkle: Good job, Spike.\nEmber: Is this another part of pony friendship? Telling each other what you learned all the time?\nTwilight Sparkle, Starlight Glimmer, and Spike: [giggling]\nStarlight Glimmer: Yeah, pretty much.\nSpike: Yup.\n\n[ponies chattering]\nSpike: [through loudspeaker] So, as a show of unity, I present the Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship to both Dragon Lord Ember and Thorax, leader of the changeling pack! May the flame of friendship burn for eternity.\n[ponies cheering]\nEmber: [sneezes]\n[whoosh]\n[crowd gasps]\n[beat]\nEmber: You should have more things made of rocks.\n[beat]\nSpike, Ember, and Thorax: [laughing]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nApplejack: [straining] [muffled] Hey, kid, get over here!\nApplejack and Apple Bloom: [straining]\n[thunk]\nApplejack: Tents are lookin' good. And we made good time today. At this rate, we'll be at Winsome Falls by tomorrow!\nApple Bloom: We should do the annual Big-Sister-Little-Sister camping trip every weekend!\nApplejack: Then it wouldn't be annual. And if we did it every weekend, it probably wouldn't be as special.\nApple Bloom: But the more we do it, the better we get at camping. Remember the first time we came here and Rarity had that ginormous tent?\nRarity: I heard that! [giggles] I've gotten much better at \"roughing it\", haven't I?\nSweetie Belle: Yup. This time, you only packed three suitcases.\nRarity: I know what you're thinking. But I promise, I only brought the essentials.\nApplejack: Like those light thingies?\nRarity: Of course. What is life if you can't make it beautiful?\n[bushes rustling]\nRainbow Dash: Mmmm! These berries look good enough to eat!\nScootaloo: Don't! According to my book, they're extremely poisonous!\n[berries falling]\nScootaloo: [sighs]\n[leaf landing]\nScootaloo: [gasps]\n[snap]\nScootaloo: [grunts, screams]\nRainbow Dash: What?\nScootaloo: I heard something, I stepped on something, and I saw that creepy cave... I guess I still get a little bit scared out here, even after the last camping trip.\nRainbow Dash: Don't worry, kid. You've got a big sister this time.\n\nApple Bloom: This looks amazing!\nScootaloo: This is gonna be the best Big-Sister-Slash-Little-Sister camping trip ever!\nApple Bloom: [chewing]\n[tea being poured]\n[Fly-der buzzing]\n[splat]\n[Fly-der swarm buzzing]\nEverypony: [screams]\n\n[theme song]\n\n[Fly-ders buzzing]\nEverypony: [indistinct complaining]\nScootaloo: Ow! What are these things?! Aaagh!\nApplejack: Fly-ders! Everypony, run for cover! Don't get stuck in their\u2014\n[thud]\nApplejack: ...web.\n[smack]\nSweetie Belle: [shrieks] Now what?!\nRainbow Dash: Follow me, everypony!\nScootaloo: Aaah! Not the scary cave!\n[whoosh]\n[Fly-der swarm buzzing]\nScootaloo: Where did those terrible bugs come from? And why did they destroy our camp?\nRainbow Dash: Ugh.\nApplejack: Flyders are from the Luna Bay area. Never seen 'em this far east, though. Probably attracted to the food. Best wait here until they're gone.\nApple Bloom: Oh, apple rot! What are we supposed to do now?! We had games to play and marshmallows to roast at camp! In here, we got nothin'!\nRarity: Mm, that's not entirely true. We have each other.\nApplejack: That's right! And if you girls want to, maybe we could tell some stories to pass the time.\nRainbow Dash: You want stories? I've got a ton of stories! Spoiler alert \u2013 they're all about me and how awesome I am!\nApplejack: I was thinkin' more like campfire stories?\nApple Bloom: But we don't even have a campfire.\nRainbow Dash: I got this!\n[whoosh]\n[Fly-ders buzzing]\n[stinging noises]\n[whoosh]\n[thud]\nApplejack: Wow. That was brave.\nRainbow Dash: [in discomfort] Eh... heh. It was no biggie. [coughs]\nScootaloo: We aren't gonna tell scary stories like our last camping trip, are we? It's bad enough just being in here!\nApplejack: Don't worry, Scootaloo. I was gonna tell you mine and Apple Bloom's favorite legend.\nApple Bloom: Ooh! You mean Rockhoof? I love that one! He was so strong, and when he\u2014\nSweetie Belle: Apple Bloom, shhh! We haven't heard it yet!\nApple Bloom: Oh, okay. But it's so good! Heh.\nApplejack: Well, it's true. Rockhoof was known far and wide for his incredible strength. But he didn't start out that way. You see, Rockhoof was a tiny little fella, the son of a farmer.\nApple Bloom: Just like us!\n[beat]\nApple Bloom: [laughs nervously]\nApplejack: They lived in a village that sat at the foot of a gigantic volcano.\n\n[flute music]\n[clink]\nApplejack: [narrating] And the village was protected by an elite group of guard ponies called the Mighty Helm.\nMighty Helm ponies: [laughing]\n[thunk]\nApplejack: [narrating] Young Rockhoof wanted nothing more than to be part of the Mighty Helm.\n[straining noises]\n[thud]\nMighty Helm ponies: [laughing]\nApplejack: [narrating] But he was told that he was too scrawny and weak to protect the village.\nMighty Helm ponies: [more laughing]\nRockhoof: [whimper]\nApplejack: [narrating] But Rockhoof wouldn't take no for an answer.\n\nApplejack: [narrating] Then, one fateful day...\n[rumbling]\nApplejack: [narrating] ...the volcano erupted!\n[boom!]\nRockhoof: Eeeeeeeeeeee\u2014\n\nApple Bloom: [continued] \u2014eeeeeeeeee! This is my favorite part!\nRainbow Dash, Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle: What happened next?!\nApplejack: The molten lava poured down the side of the volcano...\n\nMighty Helm ponies: [indistinct chatter]\nApplejack: [narrating] ...and try as they might, the Mighty Helm couldn't figure out a way to save the village! They had to evacuate. But the village ponies didn't wanna leave their homes. They spent their entire lives there. They had nowhere else to go! So Rockhoof decided to do something crazy.\n[digging]\nApplejack: [narrating] He thought if he could divert the flow of the lava, he might be able to save his village. He started diggin' a trench!\n\nSweetie Belle: Wait a minute. All by himself?\nRainbow Dash: It'd be impossible for one pony to dig a trench fast enough to stop the lava. I mean, even I couldn't do that.\nApple Bloom: [fangirl squealing]\nApplejack: Good thing Rockhoof didn't believe in the word \"impossible\".\n\nApplejack: [narrating] He continued to work, knowin' the odds were against him, but determined to push through it. Then, somethin' magical happened.\n[digging]\n[magic noises]\nApplejack: [narrating] Rockhoof got visibly stronger! But the lava was getting' closer.\n[rapid speed digging]\n[crunch]\n[steam hissing]\n[ponies cheering]\nApplejack: [narrating] Through his extraordinary determination and sheer force o' will, Rockhoof more than earned his place in the Mighty Helm.\nMighty Helm ponies: [laughing]\n\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [cheering]\nRainbow Dash: Good story, Applejack! Even if it wasn't about me.\nAll but Rainbow Dash: [giggling]\nApple Bloom: I love that story, no matter how many times I hear it.\nRarity: Why don't we see if it's safe to head back to camp?\nSweetie Belle: Uh, girls? There is no camp to go back to.\n[Fly-der swarm buzzing]\nAll but Sweetie Belle: [gasps]\n\n[Fly-der swarm buzzing]\nSweetie Belle: All our hard work is ruined!\nRarity: There, there, Sweetie Belle. Not to worry.\nSweetie Belle: How? Our camp was so pretty, and this cave is so... not.\nRarity: Oh, no-no-no-no, no, not true. There's beauty in everything. Even these blah rocks aren't really blah. If you look closely, you can see flecks of gold in them. And the way the firelight dances on the cave wall, shadow and light? Ooh, it's so gorgeous! Sweetie Belle, have I ever told you about my favorite legend?\nSweetie Belle: No. I didn't know you had one.\nRarity: Her name... was Mistmane.\nRainbow Dash: Mistmane? Isn't she the old wrinkly sorceress with the flower?\nRarity: Yeeees, but did you know she used to be the most beautiful unicorn in all the land?\nRainbow Dash: [flatly] No.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: So what happened to her?!\nRarity: Well, Mistmane was a very promising young sorceress.\n\n[Asian-style music]\nRarity: [narrating] She was as talented as she was beautiful and kind. Everypony loved her and missed her when she was sent to the finest magic school.\n\nRarity: [narrating] While she was gone, she was delighted to find out that her best friend, Sable Spirit, was crowned empress. She couldn't wait to return home once she finished her studies.\n\nRarity: [narrating] But once she arrived, she was devastated by what she saw.\nMistmane: What happened here?\nVillager: The Empress happened. She makes everypony work day and night on her palace. We don't have time to take care of anything else.\nMistmane: But that can't be. I know her! She would never do this.\nRarity: [narrating] But there was no denying what was in front of her.\nFoal: [gasps]\nRarity: [narrating] Sable Spirit took everything that was beautiful away from anypony else! And Mistmane was sure there had to be some explanation.\n\nSweetie Belle: I'd assume there was, too. If somepony told me either one of you two'd gone evil...\nScootaloo: Yeah, I'd never believe it.\nApple Bloom: I dunno. I've seen the way you two get when you miss breakfast.\n[beat]\nApple Bloom: [chuckles nervously] Just kiddin'. But I'd want answers too.\nRarity: So did Mistmane. She went to confront her friend.\n\nMistmane: Sable, is that you?\nSable Spirit: Don't tell me you don't recognize your old friend.\nMistmane: I don't. My friend would never work our families and friends to the bone for something as silly as a palace.\nSable Spirit: Silly? My palace is a beacon of beauty! Anypony who passes will be in awe of its majesty!\nMistmane: What good is a pretty palace if it just hides the misery of its ponies?\nSable Spirit: Beauty is everything. You taught me that.\nMistmane: What?!\nSable Spirit: You were always the pretty one. You got to go to the best magic school. Everypony missed you. Everypony loved you! I admit I was jealous, so I tried to perform a spell that would make me beautiful. You can see how that went!\nMistmane: [gasps]\nSable Spirit: I found if I couldn't have beauty, I would take it. I wasn't chosen to be empress, you know. I took it! Just like I'm going to take everything else.\nMistmane: I can't let you do that.\nSable Spirit: Let me? [laughs]\n[magic zaps]\nSable Spirit: [grunts, growls]\n[magic dragons roaring]\n[magic zaps]\n[wood creaking]\nSable Spirit: [grunts]\n[ponies cheering]\nRarity: [narrating] Everypony thought Sable Spirit was defeated, and that was that. But Mistmane knew there was more she could do to help.\n\nRarity: [narrating] Beauty isn't everything. But Mistmane knew that it does have the power to make ponies smile.\n[magic noises]\nRarity: [narrating] She made a huge sacrifice to bring that smile back to her friends' and family's faces... including Sable Spirit's.\nSable Spirit: [gasps] You did this for me? Even after I was so cruel?\nRarity: [narrating] Sable Spirit was so touched that she vowed to be more like her friend in the ways that mattered. From then on, she ruled with kindness and compassion.\n[ponies cheering]\nRarity: [narrating] Even though she gave away her physical beauty, she dedicated her life to spreading beauty all over Equestria. Any time you go out of your way to brighten somepony's day by doing something like giving them flowers, you're following in the hoofsteps of Mistmane.\n\nSweetie Belle: I think she's my favorite legend too.\n[Fly-ders buzzing]\n[splat, hiss]\nScootaloo: [screaming]\nRainbow Dash: Ugh! These Fly-ders won't quit! What do they want from us now?\nApplejack: Well, like it or not, we're food, too.\nSweetie Belle: And I've got the bites to prove it.\nScootaloo: [panicking] What are we gonna do?! They're almost here!\n[thwack]\n[rubble falling]\n[beat]\nRainbow Dash: What?! Now those bugs can't get in!\nScootaloo: [hyperventilating] And we can't get out!\n\nScootaloo: [hyperventilating]\nApplejack: Let's all just stay calm. Let me re-light this fire...\n[sticks rubbing]\n[flames crackling]\nRarity: We just have to wait until the swarm moves on. Then we'll think of a way out.\nScootaloo: How long will that be?! Don't bears live in caves?! [moaning]\nRainbow Dash: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Scootaloo. You're focusing on the wrong things.\nScootaloo: You have a plan?!\nRainbow Dash: Close. I have a story.\nApplejack: Lemme guess \u2013 it's about you?\nRainbow Dash: Practically. It's about my favorite legend, Flash Magnus!\nApple Bloom: Wasn't he the pony who took on the dragons?\nScootaloo: Dragons?! Big, scary, mean ones or like Spike?\nRainbow Dash: Oh, these were definitely the big, scary, mean kind!\nScootaloo: [panicked sigh]\nRainbow Dash: But not too scary. You can sit closer to me if you want.\n[zoom-thump]\nRainbow Dash: A long time ago, before the Wonderbolts were even founded...\n\nRainbow Dash: [narrating] ...Flash Magnus was a lowly cadet in the Royal Legion.\n[heroic music]\n[smacks]\n[plane propellor noises]\nRainbow Dash: [narrating] And the Legion needed to fly over the Dragon Lands to get to their comrades on the other side. But as they got closer to the dragons...\nFlash Magnus: [coughing]\nRainbow Dash: [narrating] ...the dragons attacked!\n[dragons roaring]\n\nScootaloo: [shivering] You said this wasn't too scary!\nRainbow Dash: [very muffled] Scootaloo, if you just hang in there\u2014\nScootaloo: What?\n[stretching, snap]\nRainbow Dash: I said if you just hang in there, I promise you'll like the ending. So, like I was saying, Flash Magnus and the Royal Legion tried to get past the dragons...\n\nRainbow Dash: [narrating] ...but the dragons wouldn't let them!\n[dragons roaring]\nCommander Ironhead: Everypony, retreat!\nRainbow Dash: [narrating] Flash Magnus and a few other cadets were separated from the battalion. He managed to get away, but the dragons captured his friends and took them back to their lair!\n[Legion cadets screaming]\n[plane propellor noises]\n[thump]\nFlash Magnus: Commander! We need to save our captured comrades!\nCommander Ironhead: I appreciate your loyalty, Flash Magnus, but getting past those dragons is going to be impossible. Nothing will work.\n\nApple Bloom: The commander was right. You can't outfight dragons.\nRainbow Dash: But you can out-think them.\n\nFlash Magnus: Commander Ironhead, I'm pretty sure I can outfly the dragons. If I can lure them into chasing me, you can all sneak into the lair and retrieve our friends before they get back.\nCommander Ironhead: Are you really willing to take that chance, soldier?\nFlash Magnus: I am, sir.\nCommander Ironhead: It's a very brave thing you're doing. You'll need all the help you can get.\n[clank, shing!]\nFlash Magnus: Is this... Netitus, the fireproof shield?!\nCommander Ironhead: It has protected Legion heroes for generations. And today, I can't think of a worthier flank for Netitus to protect.\n[clank]\nCommander Ironhead: Good luck, soldier.\n[plane propellor noises]\nFlash Magnus: [exhales] [shouting] Hey! Come and get me, fire-breath! If you can! [clanking shield] Hey, hey! Come and get me! Hey, I'm over here!\n[dragon roars]\nRainbow Dash: [narrating] While Flash Magnus bravely flew for his life, Commander Ironhoof was able to get his soldiers back.\n[dragons roaring]\n[plane propellor noises]\nRainbow Dash: [narrating] Flash Magnus flew like the wind...\n[dragon roaring]\n[shield burning]\nRainbow Dash: [narrating] ...faster than the dragons!\n[burning]\nRainbow Dash: [narrating] But he knew he couldn't do this forever. Luckily, he had a plan.\n[lightning striking]\n[electricity crackling]\nCommander Ironhead: [whistles]\n[plane propellor noises]\nRainbow Dash: [narrating] He led the dragons straight into a storm that the Legion had planted!\n[lightning striking]\nRainbow Dash: [narrating] One taste of the lightning, and the dragons retreated.\n[long pause]\n[pomf]\nFlash Magnus: [coughs]\nRainbow Dash: [narrating] Flash Magnus' plan worked!\n[Legion cadets cheering]\n\nScootaloo: Wow! I did like that ending.\nRainbow Dash: Told ya! He always inspired me to be my brave and awesome self.\nApple Bloom: Mm-hmm!\nApplejack: Yeah, I guess he kinda reminds me of you.\nRainbow Dash: Tch! You guess? Come on, I'm just like him!\nAll but Rainbow Dash: [laughing]\nApplejack: Hey, do you hear that?\nApple Bloom: Uh, I don't hear anythin'.\nApplejack: Exactly! Those gosh-darn Fly-ders are gone!

This trip is awesome!\nRarity: It is?\nSweetie Belle: We got to hear legendary stories and go on an adventure.\nApplejack: Wait, you three wanna stay?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Of course we do!\nSweetie Belle: We could turn those trees into a nice little shelter!\nApple Bloom: We can get you some big logs and branches to help build it!\nScootaloo: And I bet we could find some more berries! Come on! I can't wait to see what happens next year!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Ha! Straight to the changeling hive! I told you I could do it.\nTrixie: Well, not exactly straight, Starlight. We've been popping all around Equestria, and we still have to walk.\nStarlight Glimmer: [scoffs] It's like twelve steps away. Before Chrysalis' throne was destroyed, the closest magic would've gotten us was waaaaaaay over there. On a scale of one to ten, how happy do you think Thorax is gonna be about our surprise visit?\nTrixie: Definitely ten. I mean, who wouldn't be happy at the chance to marvel at the overwhelming talent that is the Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie?!\n[fireworks]\nStarlight Glimmer: Trixie, we're coming to offer Thorax encouragement and support. His letters make it seem like the responsibilities of being a changeling leader are a little overwhelming.\nTrixie: Yeah. I know. That's basically what I said.\nStarlight Glimmer: He's dealing with the wants and needs of his subjects. Redesigning the hive, a dread maulwurf wreaking havoc outside...\nTrixie: It does sound like a lot, but are you sure that last thing is real?\nStarlight Glimmer: The dread maulwurf? Sure it is. Thorax said it's like half-bear, half-mole, half-raging-pile-of-claws! But now that the changelings don't feed on the love of everything around them, plants have started to grow back. But this maulwurf keeps eating them all up.\nTrixie: \"Maulwurf\". Uh-huh. You're just trying to scare me, but it won't work. Because not only am I the Great and Powerful, I am also the Unscareable Trixie!\nPharynx: [growls]\nTrixie: [screams] Please tell me Thorax also mentioned a terrifying-looking changeling who greets visitors but is actually nice!\nStarlight Glimmer: [meakly] Nope.\nPharynx: And I'm not nice. [growls]\n[magic blasts]\nTrixie: Starlight, you got us here. I'll take us home. Teleportation spell, go! Did I save us?\nStarlight Glimmer: Nope.\n[dun-dun-dun]\n\n[theme song]\n\n[suspenseful music]\nTrixie: What are you waiting for?! Use some magic to get us outta here!\nStarlight Glimmer: Calm down, \"Unscareable Trixie\". We have to find out what's going on. Thorax might need our help.\nTrixie: We need our help! Teleportation spell, go! Teleportation spell, go! [gasps] Teleportation spell\u2014!\nStarlight Glimmer: Ugh! Why do you keep doing that? You know it doesn't work that way.\nTrixie: I know, but this is my process.\n[thud]\nStarlight Glimmer and Trixie: [yelp]\nPharynx: I've captured these trespassers!\nThorax: Starlight! Trixie! It's okay, Pharynx. You can let them go.\nPharynx: But they were lurking on our grounds! In the old days, I would've already feasted on their love.\nThorax: Well, that's why they're called the \"old days\", because they're old. We don't do that anymore.\n[celestial music]\nPharynx: Dah! I liked the old days better.\nThorax: Uh, what are you two doing here?\nStarlight Glimmer: We wanted to surprise you. [sheepishly] Surprise.\nThorax: Well, it's great to see you! I'm sorry about the welcome committee.\nPharynx: [hisses]\n[changelings yelp]\nStarlight Glimmer: I thought Ember helped you get more assertive so you could deal with all the renegade changelings who didn't wanna change.\nThorax: Oh, she did. Really helpful. I was able to convince all of them to change, except one of them... My brother.\nStarlight Glimmer: Your brother?\nThorax: Yep. Pharynx is my elder broodmate.\nPharynx: Ha! [grunting]\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, yeah. You guys have the same... um... eye shape?\nPharynx: What a ridiculous comparison! We are nothing alike!\nThorax: [sighs]\nPharynx: [grunts]\nThorax: Stop doing that!\nPharynx: The hive looked better with holes. [hissing]\n[plink]\nThorax: Ugh. Well, how about I show you the rest of the hive where it's less loud and bangy?\n\nThorax: There've been a lot of changes since you were here last. I'm trying to start some new activities since the only thing we did before was hunt and patrol. There's theatre, swing dancing, a once-a-week potluck lunch. Ooh! And who can change shape and organize craft time? Hmm? [transformation noise] This guy!\nStarlight Glimmer: I am really impressed, Thorax. The hive, all the activities...\nSclerite: Gah! He did it again! Pharynx dumped an entire can of black paint on me! He said my fuchsia color wasn't \"intimidating to our enemies\"! What enemies?!\nThorax: I am so sorry. I promise I'll talk to him.\nSclerite: You're the ruler of the hive, Thorax! You need to do more than talk!\nTrixie: Well, maybe not everything here is amazing.\nStarlight Glimmer: Seriously, Thorax. What is up with your brother?\nThorax: Ugh. Pharynx used to be head of patrol. But now we're peaceful and there's no need to patrol, so he just stalks around the hive making everyone miserable. The other changelings are sick of it, and if I can't get him to accept love and friendship and change like the rest of us, everything I've done here is at risk.\n[beat]\nTrixie: Uh-uh.\nStarlight Glimmer: [encouragingly] Hmm?\nTrixie: [sighs] Uh-huh.\nStarlight Glimmer: We know a thing or two about what it's like to be outsiders. Maybe we could talk to him for you.\nThorax: Do you really think you can help?\nTrixie: Thorax, if there's anypony who can help your brother, it's me. And with Starlight helping, it might take slightly longer, but I guarantee you we can do it.\nStarlight Glimmer: [groan]\nFrenulum: Thorax, we're ready to start work on the trail of plants to lead the maulwurf away.\nThorax: Oh, I have to head outside. You sure you're okay handling Pharynx?\nStarlight Glimmer: Absolutely.\nPharynx: [angry grunting]\nTrixie: Yeah... we totally got this. [chuckles nervously]\nPharynx: [continues grunting]\n\nPharynx: [angry grunting]\nTrixie: So, how do you wanna play this? I'm thinking \"good pony/bad pony\". You yell and blast him with magic while my natural charisma will convince him that\u2014 uh, Starlight?\nStarlight Glimmer: Hey, Pharynx. I know when we first met, it didn't go so well.\nPharynx: I put you in a bag. I thought it went great. [grunts]\nStarlight Glimmer: Right. [clears throat] So... not a big fan of the vines, huh?\nPharynx: They're a safety hazard. An enemy could hide in them or use them as weapons. I don't even know why they're here.\nStarlight Glimmer: Because they're pretty?\nPharynx: That's ridiculous.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, totally. We get you. But... [clears throat] maybe don't express how you feel by destroying them?\nPharynx: I don't take advice from ponies. The only thing I take from you is breakfast. At least, I used to.\nTrixie: You know, you're a lot like us!\nPharynx: Doubt it.\nTrixie: It's true. Do you know who Twilight Sparkle is?\nPharynx: No.\nTrixie: Well, she's the most well-liked, studious, do-goodiest pony in Equestria.\nPharynx: Ugh! She sounds awful.\nTrixie: Oh, you'd hate her. I used to. She made me unsure about my place in the world, which led me to act out against her.\nStarlight Glimmer: And I used to be a dictator who ran a village with an iron hoof.\nPharynx: Really? Hmm. Maybe you two do understand me.\nStarlight Glimmer: Yes! We do! But now, Trixie has come to terms with being second-best, and I no longer control ponies against their will. And our lives are so much better for it.\nPharynx: Wow. So you're both losers. Stay away from me, or I'll do to you what I did to the vines.\nThorax: Well, \"Operation: Lead Maulwurf Away\" is coming along. How'd it go with Pharynx?\nStarlight Glimmer: Your brother is, um, challenging.\nThorax: Oh, that bad, huh?\nStarlight Glimmer: It wasn't great.\nThorax: You wanna talk it out? You can come with me to the feelings forum.\nTrixie: The feel-like-what-now?\nThorax: Oh, it's a place for changelings to express their feelings so we all gain a better understanding of each other. It's really helped bring the hive closer together.\n\nGreen Changeling: Sometimes I feel like I'm a blue changeling. Sometimes I feel like I'm a purple changeling. But here I am, a green one.\nTymbal: You can be anything you want to be. Be blue one day and purple the next. Be both on the same day!\nGreen Changeling: But then I feel like I'd be living a lie.\nTymbal: It's very brave of you to share something so personal. Does anyone else have similar concerns?\nChangeling 1: I used to, but craft time has given me such a creative outlet, I feel great now!\nChangeling 2: Uh-huh. Everyone loves craft time.\n[changelings agreeing]\nChangeling 1: Well, everyone except for... you-know-who.\nChangeling 2: Yeah. You-know-who spends all his craft time making spears.\nChangeling 1: He's scary and intimidating. You-know-who makes me uncomfortable.\nGreen Changeling: He makes us all uncomfortable.\nThorax: Everyone, please! I understand Pharynx can be challenging at times.\nChangeling 1: That's an understatement. He lined a hallway with thorns!\nGreen Changeling: He teaches little changelings to growl and hiss!\nChangeling 3: My soup's too hot!\n[beat]\nChangeling 3: What? I thought the feelings forum was for sharing our problems.\nPharynx: It sounds like your lame \"feelings forum\" is for talking about me behind my back!\nTymbal: The feelings forum is for talking about anything that's bothering you. Is there something you'd like to share, Pharynx?\nPharynx: Actually, there is. The changelings used to be a fearsome swarm! Now we sit around talking about our feelings so much, you can't even stop a maulwurf from eating all your \"pretty plants\"! I could've sent that thing packing before, but I guess now we'll just try to lead it away and hope that keeps us safe!\nChangeling 1: I don't feel safe with him around!\nGreen Changeling: I'd feel safer if he were gone!\nThorax: I can't do that.\nAll changelings: We want him banished! [arguing]\nChangeling 3: [slurps] Hey, my soup's cooled down! These feeling forums are great for solving problems!\n[BWONG!]\nTymbal: Everyone, please. If we are interrupting each other, we are not affirming each other.\n[changelings resume arguing]\nTymbal: That's it! Feelings forum is over!\n[changelings grumbling]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: I... [sighs] I want to say something, but it goes against everything I've been taught as Twilight's pupil.\nTrixie: Ooh! Then, by all means, say it.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] I think Pharynx is a lost cause.\nTrixie: Mm. I'm all for second chances. Third, even. But he just seems like a bad bug.\nStarlight Glimmer: And Thorax has a duty to the whole hive, not just his brother.\nTrixie: If he keeps sticking up for Pharynx, the hive might decide they don't want Thorax as their leader.\nStarlight Glimmer: I think he might have to kick Pharynx out. But I don't wanna be the one to tell Thorax that.\nTrixie: Me, neither. But somepony probably should. I nominate you!\nStarlight Glimmer: Ugh!\n[transformation noise]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Thorax, we have something to tell you.\nThorax: It's about Pharynx, isn't it?\nTrixie: [hesitating] Mmmmmmmaybe?\nThorax: Look, I know he's an aggressive warrior type, but when I was little, every young changeling wanted to be like that.\n\n[young changelings shouting]\nThorax: [voiceover] ...Every young changeling except me. The others would pick on me for not wanting to fight.\nYoung Changeling: Look at the little grub playing with his dollies!\n[young changelings laugh]\nYoung Pharynx: Step away from my brother!\n[slam]\nThorax: [voiceover] But Pharynx never let them hurt me.\nYoung Changeling: We were just complimenting his dollies.\n[transformation noise]\nYoung Pharynx: [shrieks]\n[young changelings scream]\n[transformation noise]\nYoung Thorax: Thanks, Pharynx.\nYoung Pharynx: Why are you hitting yourself?! Stop hitting yourself! Why are you hitting yourself?!\nYoung Thorax: Ouch! Cut it out, Pharynx!\nYoung Pharynx: They're right, you know. You need to have tougher skin.\n\nTrixie: Aw, that was a really sweet story. Until the end.\nThorax: I know Pharynx loved me in his own way, and I know there's still good in him. That's why I keep sticking up for him. Anyway, what did you wanna talk to me about?\nTrixie: Me? Oh, noooo. But, uh, Starlight has something she\u2014\nStarlight Glimmer: Actually, Thorax, um, never mind! C'mon, Trixie, we've got a... thing to do.\n\nTrixie: [whispering] What are you doing? I thought we agreed you'd tell Thorax he had to kick his brother out of the hive!\nStarlight Glimmer: Maybe we don't have to. Get Pharynx and meet me at the hive entrance. I'll explain everything.\n[magic zap]\nTrixie: And how am I supposed to know where Pharynx is?!\nPassing Changeling: I just saw Pharynx.\nTrixie: Oh! Well, that was easy.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: We'll just use one problem to solve another. I switched the trail of plants around to lure the maulwurf here. The changelings may not be able to stop it anymore, but Pharynx certainly can. When it attacks, he'll save his brother, showing everypony his good side, the others will accept him, and Pharynx will finally let love and friendship into his life and transform! [pants]\nTrixie: Wow.\nStarlight Glimmer: I know, right? Great idea? Where's Pharynx?\nTrixie: He's gone.\nStarlight Glimmer: Gone like gone to the throne room?\nTrixie: Gone like gone! One of the changelings said Pharynx left the hive for good!\n[changelings cheering]\nStarlight Glimmer: [gasp] Then who's gonna stop the dread maulwurf I'm leading here?!\n[changelings screaming]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: [panting] Thorax, there you are! Pharynx is missing!\n[changelings cheering]\nTrixie: Wait for it...\nStarlight Glimmer: And the dread maulwurf is coming this way!\n[changelings screaming]\nTrixie: Told ya.\nThorax: That doesn't make any sense. The trail of plants should have led the dread maulwurf away.\nStarlight Glimmer: [nervous laugh] I might have relaid them to lead it back toward the hive.\nThorax: Why would you do that?!\nStarlight Glimmer: I thought if Pharynx saw you were in danger, the loving, caring side of him would come out when he protected you!\nThorax: But instead, he's out there alone somewhere between us and that rampaging monster?! I have to save him!\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm coming with you!\nThorax: Of course you are! This is all your fault!\nTrixie: [condescending] Oh, don't be too hard on Starlight. Her heart was in the right place.\nThorax: You're coming, too!\nTrixie: Oh. Right. I mean, I was gonna volunteer anyway...\nThorax: Who else is coming?\n[beat]\nThorax: [groans] Fine.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, sure, you could all stay here, not help Pharynx and he won't bother you anymore. It's your choice. But remember when you didn't have a choice! When you were forced to obey Chrysalis! You might have been unstoppable, but you weren't free to choose! And now you are, because of Thorax! Well, it's his brother out there, and now it's your chance to prove you're just as strong embracing love as you were feeding on it! Now is your chance to show what changelings can really be! Not because you have to, but because you choose to!\n\nTrixie: That was an amazingly epic speech, Starlight! I just can't believe not a single changeling was moved by it.\nThorax: I can't blame them. If he wasn't my brother, I don't think I'd be here. We're gonna have to face the maulwurf by ourselves.\nStarlight Glimmer: Maybe it'll be long gone and we'll find Pharynx out here alone!\n[roar]\nPharynx: [grunts]\nStarlight Glimmer: Or maybe not.\n[maulwurf growling]\n[transformation noise]\n[Pharynx-bug skreeing]\nThorax: Pharynx!\nPharynx: What are you doing here?!\nThorax: I'm here to save you!\nPharynx: Get outta here! Let me handle this!\nStarlight Glimmer: We're not leaving you!\n[maulwurf growling and roaring]\n[magic zap]\n[maulwurf roaring]\nThorax: [nervous] I may have forgotten to mention in my letters that maulwurfs have really thick hides!\n[maulwurf growling and snapping]\nStarlight Glimmer: I thought you said you could beat this thing!\nPharynx: Yeah, with the rest of the swarm! Not alone!\nChangeling 1: Good thing you're not alone!\nTrixie: I told you it was an epic speech.\n[changeling battle-cry]\n[smack!]\n[thud]\n[maulwurf roars]\nThorax: It's no use! We're out of practice and he's too tough!\n[maulwurf roars]\nTrixie: And strong! Too bad we can't get it to fight itself!\nPharynx: That's it! Thorax, remember when we were young and I made you hit yourself?\nThorax: Now is not the time to make fun of me, Pharynx!\n[beat]\nThorax: Oh, right! Of course!\n[maulwurf roaring]\n[slap]\nPharynx: Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?!\nThorax: Yeah, maulwurf, why are you hitting yourself?\n[crunch]\nThorax: Why are you hitting yourself, huh? Huh? Huh?\n[thud]\nPharynx: [hisses]\n[crunch]\nTrixie: Ooh, that looks like it hurts.\n[maulwurf roars]\n[digging]\nStarlight Glimmer: We did it! It's gone!\n[changelings cheering]\nThorax: What were you doing out here?\nPharynx: Leaving. I'm done with all of you.\nThorax: Oh. It's just, why bother fighting the maulwurf then? You coulda left it alone.\nPharynx: Well, I couldn't just let it attack you!\nThorax: But I thought you were done with us, and you didn't care.\nPharynx: I never said that. The hive is the thing I care about most.\nThorax: Well, you certainly don't act like it.\nPharynx: Well, I'm sorry if I don't get excited about pretty flowers and feeling circles and\u2014\nThorax: It's a feelings forum.\nPharynx: Whatever. It doesn't matter. Even if I do care about the hive, I obviously don't have a place there anymore.\nChangeling 1: Actually, you do. Because we've been wrong. Um, the hive may be a gentler, nicer place...\nChangeling 2: ...but that doesn't mean we won't have to defend ourselves. Clearly.\nThorax: And who better to help us do that than the only changeling who never stopped protecting us?\n[changelings chattering]\nPharynx: You all want me to stay?\nThorax: Unless you still want to leave the hive.\nPharynx: Why would I want that? I love the hive!\n[changelings cheering]\n[magic noises]\n[changelings oohing and aahing]\nTrixie: He did it! He transformed!\nStarlight Glimmer: I always knew you had it in you!\nPharynx: Really? Because I thought you said I was a lost cause and you were going to tell Thorax he should kick me out.\nTrixie: Oh! Starlight! How could you say that?\nStarlight Glimmer: Ugh! What?! That's\u2014! I mean\u2014! But you\u2014!\nThorax: Lucky for us, you weren't a lost cause.\nPharynx: Lucky for me, you didn't give up on me.\n[changelings chattering]\nTrixie: Soooo... glad everything worked out.\nThorax: Yeah! Let's talk about how you not only led the maulwurf to the hive but also drove my brother away from it!\nStarlight Glimmer: I am so sorry about that, but I would like to point out that my admittedly terrible plan did bring everything together in the end. [nervous laugh]\nPharynx: Hey. Do you guys want to hear the story about how I used to make Thorax hit himself?\nStarlight Glimmer: [relieved] Oh, absolutely, yes, right now!\nPharynx: Well, when we were young, every changeling wanted to be a warrior. Except for Thorax. He was a little weak. I had to protect him... [fades out]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nNewspaper Pony: Morning, Pinkie Pie.

Coming back here was a mistake!\n\nRainbow Dash: Come on, A. K.! So we picked a bad example. That was just one angry pony.\nPinkie Pie: Two angry ponies!\nA. K. Yearling: It doesn't matter! I never should have come with you! You two should just go home!\nRainbow Dash: Come on! We gotta follow her!\nPinkie Pie: I dunno. It really seemed like she doesn't want us cramping her saddle.\nRainbow Dash: But we have to convince her that ponies do appreciate her! As her friend, I have to make sure she believes that.\n\nRainbow Dash: Look, Pinkie! It's the Get On Inn! Daring Do stays here all the time in her adventures. Which means there must be ponies here who love Daring Do! Maybe they can help us.\nPinkie Pie: [sniffing] Mmmmm. My nose is telling me to help myself to muffins.\n\n[bell ringing]\nRainbow Dash: Come on...\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, she's fancy. I got this. [to Mrs. Trotsworth] A good evening to you, madame. We are but weary travelers who humbly wish to inquire on the status of a certain mare of intrigue taking residence here.\nMrs. Trotsworth: What in Southern Equestria are you on about?\nPinkie Pie: Is it true that Daring Do stays here?\nMrs. Trotsworth: Ha! Not anymore, she doesn't!\nRainbow Dash: Why not?\nMrs. Trotsworth: The last time I rented that rascal a room, she was in such a rush to hightail it outta here, she didn't even pay her bill!\nRainbow Dash: But\u2014\nMrs. Trotsworth: After that, a band of ruffians showed up and destroyed half the rooms looking for her. Guess she made them even more mad than she made me!\nRainbow Dash: No, no, no. You've got it all wrong.\nMrs. Trotsworth: Hmph! How do you figure?\nRainbow Dash: Daring Do was trying to save everypony from the curse of the Doomed Diadem of Xilati. And she was only in a rush because she had to get the crown back to the Tiara of Teotlale before the curse took effect. [to Pinkie Pie] Chapter seventeen.\nMrs. Trotsworth: Sounds like a tall tale to me. And a hard one to believe, now that I know Daring Do is a scoundrel and a thief! Every year, ponies come to offer precious glowpaz to the Somnambula statue in the village in hopes for a good future. Why, that poor fella had his glowpaz necklace stolen by Daring Do just yesterday!\nRainbow Dash: Hmmm...\nRainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie: [gasps] There's A. K.!\nDr. Caballeron: Daring Do ruined our town and stole our precious glowpaz! We need to make sure that if she turns up again, there will be consequences! Everypony who's with me, meet at the statue tomorrow!\n[ponies agreeing]\nA. K. Yearling: [sighs] Now I'm getting blamed for things I didn't even do? Why would I steal from them?\nPinkie Pie: They are super bad! But we're still staying the night, right? [chomp] Because I already ate all the free mini muffins! [giggles]\nRainbow Dash: Listen, A. K. After a good night's sleep, we're going to fix all of this. I promise.\n\n[ponies murmuring]\nA. K. Yearling: I shouldn't be here, Rainbow Dash. This is never gonna work.\nRainbow Dash: Of course it will! All I have to do is go up there and explain to everypony how wrong they all are.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! And then I'll be like, \"What she said!\"\nA. K. Yearling: [sighs] Easy-peasy-cheesy...\nPinkie Pie: Exactly!\nDr. Caballeron: Here it is! The remains of your\u2013 I mean, our Somnambula statue! Now that Daring Do has destroyed it, tell me, where will we hang our glowpaz?\nRandom Villager: We don't even have any glowpaz because they were stolen by Daring Do!\n[ponies shouting and booing]\nRainbow Dash: Daring Do would never steal anything! And okay, she destroyed your statue, but it was because she was trying to save you all from Ahuizotl!\n[confused chattering]\nRainbow Dash: Ahuizotl? He's about yea big? Long neck? Itty-bitty face? Weird claw thingy on his tail?\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! Ooh! I know him! He's a baddie!\n[concerned murmuring]\nRainbow Dash: Trust me, if Ahuizotl had gotten away with the Doomed Diadem, your entire village would have been swallowed up! And that's a lot worse than losing some crummy old statue!\n[ponies gasping]\n\"Cortland\": Ahem! This was not some crummy old statue! It was the namesake of our town! If you want to understand us, you must first understand her.\nRainbow Dash: Who?\n\"Cortland\": Somnambula. Long ago...\n\n\"Cortland\": [narrating] ...this village fell prey to an evil Sphinx who demanded most of their crops. Like her fellow villagers, Somnambula didn't have much, but she used what she had to keep others from giving up hope. The son of the Pharaoh, Prince Hisan, was so moved by her compassion that he decreed nopony would go hungry again. But when Hisan stood up to the Sphinx, the beast captured him, telling the Pharaoh the only way to get Hisan back was to solve her riddle. Nopony would volunteer to save the prince. Nopony except Somnambula.\n[adventurous music]\n\"Cortland\": [narrating] The Sphinx gave her the riddle. \"I shine brightest in the dark. I am there but cannot be seen. To have me costs you nothing. To be without me costs you everything.\" As Somnambula thought of the hardship she and her fellow villagers had experienced, she instantly knew the answer. \"Hope!\", she shouted.\n[Sphinx roaring]\n\"Cortland\": [narrating] The Sphinx was so enraged, it seemed she might still refuse to release the prince, so Somnambula asked her for one more challenge. But if she accomplished it, the Sphinx would leave from the kingdom forever. The Sphinx quickly agreed, asking only that Somnambula walk to the prince across a deep chasm... blindfolded! Further, the Sphinx had cast a powerful spell that prevented Somnambula from flying.\n[Sphinx laughing evilly]\n\"Cortland\": [narrating] But Somnambula never lost hope! She knew she'd need to make a leap of faith to save the prince. Guided by the sound of the prince's voice... she easily made it across.\n[Sphinx roaring]\n\"Cortland\": [narrating] The Pharaoh asked how Somnambula prevailed, and she explained that she had always hoped she could make things better for her people and that hope had carried her through. The Prince replaced the pearls Somnambula gave up with a string of glowpaz. And around her neck, they glowed bright enough to light the entire kingdom.\n\n\"Cortland\": Forever after, glowpaz became our symbol of hope.\n[ponies chattering]\nRainbow Dash: Wow. I had no idea how special the statue was to you. Somnambula sounds like a pretty cool pony. But I bet if she were here, she'd tell you how cool Daring Do is too, because they've both fought to protect this town!\n[ponies chattering]\nDr. Caballeron: If Somnambula were here today, she would condemn Daring Do for destroying your\u2013 our symbol of hope!\n[ponies booing and shouting]\n\nRainbow Dash: Hey, buddy! What did Daring Do ever do to you to deserve all this?!\nDr. Caballeron: Only... everything!\nRainbow Dash: Dr. Caballeron?!\nDr. Caballeron: Yes... Rainbow Dash. [laughing evilly] When I saw you, her closest friend, I knew that Daring Do would not be far behind. I really do owe you for leading her right to me.\nRainbow Dash: But I-I didn't mean to\u2014\nDr. Caballeron: Thank you for helping me break Daring Do's spirit by destroying her reputation, but I can't have you running off and telling her my plan. [whistles]\nRainbow Dash: Help!\nA. K. Yearling: Caballeron?! No!\nPinkie Pie: He's got Rainbow Dash! Come on!\n\nPinkie Pie: [panting] I'm... coming... Rainbow... Dash... [to Daring Do] Ah! I knew you'd come!\nDaring Do: You did? I sure didn't. What if I cause more trouble?\nPinkie Pie: You won't.\nDaring Do: How do you know?\nPinkie Pie: I just do! You wouldn't let anything happen to Rainbow Dash. You care too much.\nDaring Do: You're right. Which way did they go? To the pyramid!\n\nRainbow Dash: Somepony help! Somepony! Anypony! Pinkie Pie?! Daring Do?! Is that you?!\nPinkie Pie: Don't worry, Rainbow! We'll save you!\n[rumbling, gurgling]\nDr. Caballeron: [laughing evilly] If my previous plan didn't cause you to give up, Daring Do, then the shame of losing your dear friend Rainbow Dash to the slime will! Oh, and that ancient magic from the legend is real. There'll be no flying in the pyramid! Good luck, Daring Do! [laughing evilly]\n[slam]\nDaring Do: [grunting] He's right! We'll never get to her in time!\nPinkie Pie: If this really is like Somnambula's story, then we just have to have hope that we can.\nDaring Do: I think we need more than hope, Pinkie. There was a bridge in the story, and there's no bridge here. What are we going to do?\nRainbow Dash: [whimpering]\nPinkie Pie: I don't know, but Rainbow Dash is our friend. Just like Somnambula. We need to make a leap of faith and hope that we can save her! [grunts]\nDaring Do: Pinkie!\n[steam rushing]\nDaring Do: Aha!\nPinkie Pie: Wheeee! [giggles] I knew we'd do it!\nDaring Do: Thanks for reminding me to never give up hope, Pinkie.\nRainbow Dash: And I'm kinda \"hoping\" you ponies will untie me before we all take a bath in bubbling green slime!\nDaring Do: We're on it!\n[steam rushing]\n\n[ponies chattering]\nDaring Do: Not so fast, Caballeron!\nHenchponies: [gasps]\n[glowpaz clattering]\n\"Nile Faras\": You stole our glowpaz!\n[ponies shouting]\nDaring Do: I should have known you were just trying to sully my name so that you'd be free to steal whatever you wanted.\nDr. Caballeron: Of course that was the plan, Daring Do! At first I just wanted the glowpaz, but then I saw an opportunity to write you out of the story for good! [laughing evilly]\n[ponies gasping]\nDr. Caballeron: And with the destruction you leave in your wake, it didn't take too much to convince ponies you were a villain!\nDaring Do: You're wrong, Caballeron. And I won't let you break my spirit again. Because I'm never going to give up hope that I can protect ponies and ancient treasures from miscreants like you!\n[ponies shouting in agreement]\nDr. Caballeron: R-Remember! She ruined your statue! You're fools to believe in her! [growls] You'll pay for this, Daring Do!\n[ponies cheering]\nDaring Do: Okay, okay, that's enough. [to Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie] Thanks for helping me come to my senses. You two are true friends.\nRainbow Dash: Are you kidding? That... was... awesome!\nPinkie Pie: We're just glad you're back to your old self again.\nDaring Do: [chuckles] Me too. But I'm glad I realized that even if you're fighting for something good, you're still responsible for your actions.\nRainbow Dash: And if something bad happens that you didn't intend, you shouldn't give up hope or lose faith in yourself.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! All you gotta do is make it right. Feel free to use that in your next book!\nDaring Do: You know, I think I will.\nRainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie: [squealing and laughing]\n\n[Egyptian-style music]\n[ponies cheering]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[ponies chattering]\n[flowers rustling]\nFilthy Rich: Hmph!

We'll help all of you!\nSweetie Drops: How?!\nRarity: What I would do...\n[crowd gasps]\nRarity: ...is pick flowers that accentuate my mane. It makes for a captivating color story when you present them to whomever they're intended.\n[boop]\n[flowers rustling]\nLily Valley: That's it!\n\nRose: Color consultations was a great idea, Rarity! Now, what can we do for you?\nRarity: Oh, darling, I need a dozen lavender pieces for Photo Finish's shoot on the most beautiful manes in Equestria.\n[beat]\nRarity: I know you're swamped, but it's for Vanity Mare! She's going to take pictures of my mane, so color coordination is a must.\nRose: Anything for you, Rarity.\n\n[fans blowing]\nRarity: Have you a single big one? If the wind came from one direction, it would really intensify the effect.\nMr. Breezy: I don't. Uh, but I could make you one! It's not like I've got anything else to do.\n[door opens]\n[whistle]\nRarity: Hmm. I do enjoy the windswept look, but other ponies might need to see it before they feel it.\n[switch clicks]\n[door opens]\n[ponies aah-ing]\n\nRarity: My mane will be flowing over the chaise in the tableau I have in mind. But I was hoping to choose the color. Could you make one in a pale yellow? I need something across the color wheel from this.

More colors it is!\n[bits clinking]\n\n[bell rings]\nRarity: Pinkie? I need to put Photo Finish in a good mood, and nothing creates a better mood than your confecti\u2014 Ooh.

I can't have Photo Finish shoot my mane like this! And this party string won't come off!\nPinkie Pie: Oh, that's because it's not just party string. It's super-sticky celebration string!\nRarity: [low growl]\nPinkie Pie: Sorry. I guess my sneeze-versary was a little too sneeze-abratory. [giggles nervously]\nRarity: [shuddering sigh] It'll be fine, Pinkie. I'll find a way to clean this up before the shoot tomorrow. [whimper] Actually, you might consider doing the same.\n[stretching]\nPinkie Pie: [grunting, straining] If only we had some kind of super-sudsy mane conditioning shampoo for you and a magical cleaning remover potion for me.\nRarity: [gasps] That's it! We'll pay a visit to Zecora! She's a wonder with a cauldron. I'm sure she can mix up a fix for both of us.\nPinkie Pie: [straining]\n[splat]\nPinkie Pie: That's good, because it would take forever to yank all of those baked goods out of the super-sticky celebration string.\nRarity: I... think you may still have some baking to do.\n\n[eerie music]\nRarity: I do wish Zecora lived in town. One shouldn't have to brave the darkest part of the forest for shampoo.\nPinkie Pie: Do you think Photo Finish would want to take a picture of my mane?\n[bird flapping]\nRarity: Well, uh... Hmm...I'm not sure that your style is quite right for this particular photo essay. Photo Finish travelled everywhere in her search for the most beautiful of manes.\nPinkie Pie: [shaking]\n[poink!]\nCreature: [yelp]\nPinkie Pie: Even Yakyakistan?\nRarity: Well, yaks don't have manes, per se, and I'm not sure their style is quite what she's looking for either.\n[splash]\nRarity: Though at this moment, neither is mine.\nPinkie Pie: Don't worry! Zecora will abso-tively be able to help!\nRarity: I'm sure you're right.\n[beat]\nRarity: Listen, spooky eyes! Why don't you take a picture?! It will last longer!\n[creatures squeaking]\nRarity: On second thought, don't. Getting my picture taken in this state is what I'm trying to avoid!\n\nRarity: Are you certain that's safe?\nZecora: I'm sure they seem strange, but my methods are mine. After all, I've been doing this for quite a long time.\nPinkie Pie: I'll have those cupcakes cleaned off in no time!\nRarity: You really should bake new ones.\nPinkie Pie: Nah!\nZecora: For your mane, of course, just soap will do, so use my super-sudsy shampoo.\nRarity: Oh-ho, what a relief! I can't tell you how worried I was that my mane wouldn't be ready for the shoot. [laughs]\nZecora: You were right to be concerned. Manes are tricky, I have learned.\nRarity: Oh! [scoffs] Tell me about it!\nZecora: Cleaning is simple, but a magical fix could cause any number of troublesome ticks.\nPinkie Pie: Really?\nZecora: Oh, there are tales I could tell to make your hair stand on end. Horrifying, terrifying attempts to mane-mend!\nRarity: Well, I do enjoy a good yarn, but I'm not sure I could take anymore mane fright today.\nPinkie Pie: Well, I love a good scary story! [giggles]\nZecora: There's the contagious frizz that spreads friend to friend, or the story of the infinitely splitting end!\nRarity: [screams]\n[clatter]\nRarity: Uh-huh, hmm, yes, well, very entertaining. Uh, thanks for the shampoo. Ta-ta!\nPinkie Pie: Anything about curls that keep on curling until your whole body is one big curl?\nZecora: [laughs] There is one story I nearly forgot: of an Earth pony who needed to clean up her shop.\nPinkie Pie: Wow! That's just what I have to do! Huh, weird.\nZecora: Perhaps it'd be better if I were more clear. You can't clean up Sugarcube Corner from here.\nPinkie Pie: Geez, Zecora, I can take a hint.\nZecora: With just a few drops, any mess you'll improve if you focus on that which you want to remove.\nPinkie Pie: It won't be hard to focus on the super-sticky celebration string. It's kinda the only thing you can see.\n\nPinkie Pie: Zecora says it would only take a few drops, but I figured we should all chip in. Just in case! Remember to only focus on the party string. We don't wanna accidentally remove anything else.\nPound Cake and Pumpkin Cake: [babbling]\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! Sudsy! [giggles]\n\nRarity: [humming] A relaxing shower really gives you the chance to focus on the fabulosity of your mane! [laughs, sniff sniff] Not the most pleasant scent, but it gets the job done. [humming] My mane feels lighter alrea\u2014 [screams]\n\nZecora: [sipping]\n[door opens]\nZecora: [spits]\nRarity: It's important that you know that I am not pointing hooves, but\u2014\nZecora: I don't understand. Is that you, Rarity? Why would you think to point your hooves at me?\nRarity: Let's just say I understand why your shampoo hasn't made a splash in the marketplace.\n[cloak rustling]\nRarity: Goodness, Zecora! You could at least pretend it isn't that bad!\nZecora: I'm sorry, my dear, but there is nothing to say. You just took the wrong potion from here yesterday.\nRarity: Oh, thank goodness! I thought maybe your shampoo had triggered early-onset mare pattern baldness!\nZecora: No, this lack of hair was put into motion when you mistakenly washed with remover potion.\nRarity: [laughing] Oh, what a relief! Well, if you could just whip up a cure, I'll be on my way. So much to do before the shoot tomorrow.\nZecora: As I mentioned before, there's no easy fix. Mane-mending magic's the trickiest of tricks.\nRarity: [mumbling] Sorry?\nZecora: I doubt that your mane has left us forever. There is a chance we can fix it, I think, if we're clever.\nRarity: W-w-w-w-w-w-wait, there's, there's a chance?! You think?!\nZecora: I need to focus if I'm to work any faster. One wrong ingredient spells utter disaster. You should go finish your list of to-dos. Keep your mind off of all of these mane-losing blues.\n\n[ponies chattering]\nRarity: [exhales] There's nothing to worry about. Zecora will have a cure before I've even finished my to-dos. But I don't know if I can even show my face looking like this!\nCaramel: [gasps]\n\"Mint Flower\": [crying]\nRose: I'm sorry, miss, but I can't match your mane if I can't see it.\nGolden Harvest: What about mine?\nRose: Marigold, I should think!\nRarity: Uh, sorry.

I-I\u2014\nMr. Breezy: Kindness has nothing to do with it! Rarity always knows how to make something look its best. Probably because she looks so good herself! That ain't something us non-fabulous folk here can understand.\nRarity: N-Non-fabulous?!\n[customers agreeing]\n\n[ponies muttering]\nDavenport: Now I appreciate everypony's interest in our new sofa colors, but the yellow one is spoken for.\nRarity: Oh, thank you, Davenport. Um, perhaps I can pick it up once everypony leav\u2014\nBerryshine: I'll give you twice whatever the pony who wants to buy the yellow one is paying!\nSprinkle Medley: Three times!\nRarity: But\u2014 But\u2014 I\u2014 I\u2014\nDavenport: Sold!\n[ripping noise]\n[crowd gasps]\nRarity: [worried shriek]\n\nRarity: I can't believe how differently ponies treat you when you can't command their attention.\nTwilight Sparkle: Are you sure that's what happened?\nStarlight Glimmer: Wait. You can't command ponies' attention because your mane's messed up?\nRarity: \"Messed up\"? Does this look \"messed up\" to you?!\nTwilight Sparkle and Starlight Glimmer: [gasps]\nRarity: Honestly! How hard is it to pretend it's not so bad?\nStarlight Glimmer: Hard.\nRarity: If today is any indication of how ponies will treat me from now on, I can't simply wait to see if my mane grows back!\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sorry, Rarity. I'm sure nopony means to make you feel worse than you already do.\nStarlight Glimmer: Didn't you say Zecora was working on a cure?\nRarity: Yes, well, even if everypony isn't utterly indifferent to my presence, Zecora might not be able to fix this in time for the shoot. Can't you do a spell to restore some semblance of my mane?!\nStarlight Glimmer: The thing is, it's pretty much like Zecora said. Fixing manes with magic is\u2014\nRarity: Tricky! I know! I don't care! Make with the tricks!\nStarlight Glimmer: Huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\n[magic zap]\n\n\"Silver Medal\": [screams]\n\n[shattering]\n[magic zap]\n[bird pecking]\nRarity: This won't do! I need an actual mane!\nStarlight Glimmer: But it has to come from somewhere.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, you can't just make a mane with magic. The results could be disastrous.\nRarity: More disastrous than this?!\n[thump]\n\n[magic zaps]\n[flapping noise]\n\n[scissors snipping]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] I don't think there's anything else we can try.\nRarity: [panicked stuttering] B-But Zecora said there was still a chance!\n[door opens]\nZecora: At last, Rarity, I have searched for so long! What I told you before was totally wrong!\nTwilight Sparkle: Zecora, you found a cure? That's amazing!\nRarity: [sighs in relief] You mean I'll get my fabulous mane back in time for the shoot?\nZecora: Oh, no. I'm afraid I can't fix it before the big shoot. But in time, the hair will grow back from the root. There's no magical cure to hasten us through it, unless you went backward in time to undo it.\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh-uh. I think we can both say that's not a good option.\nRarity: [groans, bawling]\n\nRarity: I have always believed that the right outfit can make up for any other areas that are lacking. But I will need your honest opinions. [nervous ta-da] How awful is it?\nApplejack, Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash: [simultaneously] Uhhh...\nOpalescence: [yowls]\nRarity: Oh, come on! Can't anypony pretend it's not bad?!\nFluttershy: We could, um, try.\nRainbow Dash: Maybe...?\nRarity: Well, if any of you have an idea how to make this disaster look good enough for Photo Finish's piece in Vanity Mare on the most beautiful manes in Equestria, [sobbing] I'm open to hearing it!\nApplejack: Is that all?\nRainbow Dash: No problem!\nRarity: Hm?\n\n[Bessie being milked]\nRarity: I don't understand, Applejack. How is milking a cow going to help?\nApplejack: That's just it. It looks like we hired a new milkmaid...\nGranny Smith: This is pretty close to my color as a young'un!\nApplejack: Just a little down-home ingenuity.\nRarity: It's a good idea, Applejack, but Photo Finish is looking for the most beautiful manes, not bonnets.\n[thip]\nApplejack: [laughs nervously]\n\nRainbow Dash: This'll do the trick. Just you wait!\n[spinning noises]\nRarity: [gasps] You know, this is really quite fetching!\nRainbow Dash: Yes! Nailed it!\n[poof]\nRarity: ...Just not portable.\nRainbow Dash: [groans]\n\nHarry: [growling]\n[squirrel chittering]\nFluttershy: There!\nRarity: Oh, let's face it. I'll just have to call Photo Finish and cancel.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I think we all know how bad Rarity's been feeling, but I never thought she'd cancel her shoot with Photo Finish.\nRainbow Dash: You saw her mane, right?\nApplejack: But it's Rarity. If anypony can turn lemons into lemonade, it's her.\nFluttershy: I guess it's harder for her when she feels like the lemon.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, she's not a lemon \u2013 she's our friend. And right now, she needs our support.\n[knocking]\nRarity: [muffled] Come in.\n[bell rings]\nRarity: Would you mind closing the door? I'm more comfortable in the dark.\n[click]\nApplejack: Okay, Rarity, you've done just about enough sulkin'! Havin' a fabulous mane is a wonderful thing, but it ain't the only thing!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! And we're here to remind you how awesome you are, mane or no mane!\nRarity: [sighs] It's lovely of you to say, but it's hard to argue with cold, hard facts.\nFluttershy: What facts are those?\nRarity: That without my mane, I simply can't shine as I once did, and ponies treat me like the sad, invisible pony I've become.\nTwilight Sparkle: Rarity, you're not invisible. You're our friend. A friend that started a fashion empire.\nFluttershy: A friend who made us all feel beautiful in her lovely creations.\nRainbow Dash: A friend who stuck by us, no matter what!\nApplejack: A friend so generous that she once chopped off her own tail to help a sea serpent.\nTwilight Sparkle: I know you lost some confidence when you lost your mane, but unlike your hair, confidence is something you can get back right now.\nRarity: Goodness... You're right! The only pony behaving differently today was me! Besides, what doesn't shine from the outside in...\nStarlight Glimmer: Um, Rarity, what are you doing?\nRarity: I'm preparing to shine from the inside out!\n[guitar twang]\nRest of main cast and Starlight Glimmer: [gasps]\nRainbow Dash: Awesome!\n\n[flowers rustling]\nFilthy Rich: It's my own fault. I shouldn't have bought flowers without asking Spoiled what she likes.\nRose: Well, we don't have much left. What does she like?\nFilthy Rich: Um, uh... purple?\nRarity: I have a solution!\n[guitar twang]\nRose: Rarity, that mane is...\nDaisy and Lily Valley: Amazing!\nRarity: Thank you. Although I'm afraid I missed my chance at Vanity Mare, which means I have quite a few lavender arrangements to spare.\nFilthy Rich: Uh, is lavender purple?\n[flowers rustling]\n\n[fans blowing]\nRarity: Mm... The windswept look is very last-season. Perhaps you could set this up outside. It's sure to draw in the hoof traffic.\n\n[fan blowing]\nStallion: Ahhh!\n[crowd chattering]\n\n[bits clinking]\nRarity: Photoshoot or no, you can always use a chaise!\nApplejack: Well, Rarity, if you wanted to shine from the inside out, I think this afternoon, you became the brightest filly in Equestria!\nRarity: Oh, pshaw, Applejack. I'm simply making up for all the time I wasted feeling sorry for myself.\nRainbow Dash: I don't know why you were so upset. Your mane looks awesome!\nRarity: I'm just glad I have all of you to remind me that even if I accidentally use magical remover potion on my mane, I can look good on the outside as long as I feel good on the inside.\nTwilight Sparkle: How'd you end up using remover potion on your head, anyway?\nRarity: [gasps] Pinkie!\n\nRarity: If I had the remover potion this whole time, that means Pinkie must have the\u2014\n[door opens]\n[flooding noise]\nPinkie Pie: Wheeeeeeee! [giggling]\nRarity: ...shampoo.\nPinkie Pie: Shampoo? Wow! That explains why our manes are all so bouncy and soft!\n[guitar twang]\nRarity: Uh, perhaps I'll fetch the rest of that remover potion.\nPinkie Pie: Great! Hey, is there something different about you? New hoof polish?\n\nRarity: So you're sure? You're sure it's fully recovered?\nApplejack: Yes, Rarity. It's been months. Your mane looks fine.\nPinkie Pie: Oooh, look! It's the \"Most Beautiful Manes in Equestria\" issue of Vanity Mare! You should read it.\nRarity: Oh, honestly, Pinkie? After all I went through, I'm not sure it even matters what mane graces the page\u2014\n[whap]\nPinkie Pie: Read it!\nRarity: But I... I cancelled the shoot.\nApplejack: We had a little talk with Photo Finish.\nFluttershy: And explained just how beautiful we thought you were. Inside and out.\n[pages flicking]\nRainbow Dash: While you were shining from the inside out, Photo Finish took a few pictures.\nRarity: I don't know what to say!\nApplejack: Luckily, you don't have to say anything. Your style speaks for itself.\nMane cast: [encouraging noises]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nFluttershy: Thank you so much, Zecora. I never would've found the crisscross moss without you.\nZecora: Of course. I know where it grows, so it's not much to ask. Though retrieving it has been a difficult task.\nFluttershy: Oh, but the oxen visiting Sweet Feather Sanctuary next week will surely appreciate it. It really adds a shine to their coat.\n[splut]\nZecora: There we go. Now, that wasn't so tough. Fluttershy, tell me, will this be enough?\nFluttershy: Gee, I don't know. It's a pretty big pack. So maybe enough to fill up this sack? [gasps, laughs] Oh, my! You're rubbing off on me, Zecora!\nZecora: Whoa. Whoa!\n[branch snaps]\n[splash]\nFluttershy: [screams] Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no!\nZecora: [gasps]\nFluttershy: Zecora, are you all right?\nZecora: No need to fret. I only got wet. At least now I can easily grab all the crisscross moss there is to be had.\n[poof]\nFluttershy: [gasps] What's happening to you?\nZecora: Honestly, it's hard to tell. But suddenly, I don't feel so well...\nFluttershy: [gasps deeply]\n\n[theme song]\n\nDr. Horse: All right, Zecora. Let's have a listen to the old ticker.\n[jazz drum solo]\nDr. Horse: Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.\nFluttershy: Do you think it's serious, doctor?\nDr. Horse: Well, that wasn't a good sign.\nFluttershy: I can't believe a flower did this. I take back thinking it was pretty!\nZecora: [coughing]\nDr. Horse: Mm-hmm. We're looking for any color other than red.\nFluttershy: Phew. [gasps loudly]\nDr. Horse: Oh, it's just as I thought. I'm afraid you have a very rare disease called... [echoing] Swamp Fever!\n[thunder and lightning]\nZecora: Tell me, doctor. What should I do? I've never heard of Swamp Fever, mind you.\nDr. Horse: Unfortunately, very little is known about the disease. Except, of course, its symptoms \u2013 change of coat, coughing bubbles, shock sneezing, confusion, and the last stage, the afflicted turn into the very trees that drop the disease-spreading flower.\nZecora: Oh! Is there anything that can be done for such a terrible conundrum?!\nDr. Horse: A cure has yet to be discovered. I'm sorry, Zecora.\nZecora: Hmmm.\nDr. Horse: It's a lot to take in. I'll leave you two to discuss.\n[door closes]\nFluttershy: Zecora, this is all my fault! If you hadn't been helping me get the crisscross moss, you wouldn't have gotten Swamp Fever. I'm so sorry.\nZecora: Fluttershy, you are not to blame. These things happen all the same.\nFluttershy: I refuse to accept that! There has to be somepony who can help you!\nZecora: Oh. There's a healer of legend who never would fail. But I only know her from ancient folktales. Mystical and masked, she came in the night and cured everything from hoof cough to fur blight. What became of the healer, nopony knows, for she disappeared ages and ages ago.\nFluttershy: The Mystical Mask! Of course! My parents would tell me about her whenever I was sick in bed.\nZecora: There's so many accounts of her power to heal. She can't just be a legend. I think she's real.\nFluttershy: If that's who we need to cure you, then I'm going to find her! And I know just the pony who can help!\n\nFluttershy: [pants] Oh.\n[door opens]\nFluttershy: Twilight? Twilight? Twilight! Oh, I'm so sorry to bother\u2014 Are... Are you cooking?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah! Spike and I are having a cook-off!\nSpike: My cauliflower bites blew her sweet potato muffins out of the water!\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm glad you're here, Fluttershy, because we're gonna need a second opinion about that.\nFluttershy: [grunts, gulps, grunts, gulps] Um, they're both delicious, but... [quickly] Zecora-has-Swamp-Fever-and-there's-no-cure-and-it's-all-my-fault-and-the-only-pony-who-can-cure-it-is-the-Mystical-Mask-and-I-need-your-help-to-find-her!\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh...\nSpike: So, what'd she pick? The cauliflower bites, right?\n\n[pages flipping]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] That's the last book on ancient ponies, and still no mention of the Mystical Mask.\nFluttershy: Hmm. Did we check the unabridged versions?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, and the books on rare diseases, the books on rare plants, and the entire section on bog habitation.\nFluttershy: Well, we might have to look through every book in the entire library, but I know we'll figure it out.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh.\n[music]\n\nFluttershy: [sighs] Another dead end. Have you found anything yet, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: [snoring]\nFluttershy: Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Aah!\n[thud]\nFluttershy: Goodness! Are you okay?\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] I'm fine. Fluttershy, you know that I want to help Zecora. But I think we'd be a lot better off if we got some sleep. We've been at this for hours.\nFluttershy: Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize how late it had gotten.\nTwilight Sparkle: No problem. I'll grab you a pillow and\u2014\nFluttershy: Oh, no-no-no. I meant you should sleep. I can't rest until Zecora is healed.\nTwilight Sparkle: I understand how you feel, but I still think we'd have more luck if we tried again in the morning. Just promise me you'll take a break soon.\nFluttershy: [not listening] Mm-hmm.\nTwilight Sparkle: [yawns] Good night, Fluttershy.\n[door closes]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [snoring] 9-by-13-inch pan...\n[thud!]\nFluttershy: Twilight!\nTwilight Sparkle: [awake] Nonstick pans!\nSpike: [groans] What's all the commotion in here, ladies?\nFluttershy: Sorry, but I figured out who the Mystical Mask is!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] You did?!\nFluttershy: All I had to do was cross-reference a book about masks with another book on ancient Equestrian healers, then use a third book to translate it all from Olde Ponish, and there it was! Zecora was right! The Mystical Mask wasn't just a legend. The Mystical Mask was Mage Meadowbrook!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps deeply] The ancient sorceress from Hayseed Swamp? We studied her at Celestia's school! Are you sure?\nFluttershy: Absolutely! Mage Meadowbrook wasn't just a sorceress. She was also a healer, and back then, healers wore masks so they wouldn't get sick themselves!\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy, I am so incredibly proud of you for using your research skills to figure this out! But Meadowbrook lived ages ago, and didn't she disappear?\nFluttershy: Mm-hmm. But if we go to Hayseed Swamp, maybe we can find something she left behind! Something that could lead to a cure!\nTwilight Sparkle: It seems like a long shot, but I guess it's possible.\n[pyow!]\nFluttershy: [grunting] We have to try! I've got a route all planned out, and on the way, we can check up on Zecora, and then\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're leaving now?\nFluttershy: Of course! Every second we spend waiting is a second Zecora is coughing bubbles!\nTwilight Sparkle: But Fluttershy, you haven't slept! And that's a long journey!\nFluttershy: There's no use trying to talk me out of this, Twilight! [grunts] We've got no time to waste!\nTwilight Sparkle: Can we at least grab some breakfast?\nFluttershy: I packed cauliflower bites.\nTwilight Sparkle: Aw. No sweet potato muffins?\nSpike: I, uh, ate them all. They were actually really good. [chuckles]\n\nFluttershy: And that's when I realized the Mystical Mask was actually Mage Meadowbrook!\nZecora: [coughs] That's marvelous, Fluttershy. I am quite impressed. While you are gone on your journey, I'll try not to be... worried.\nFluttershy: [gasps] Oh, no. Zecora, you didn't rhyme! You must be getting worse.\nZecora: Oh. No, no, no, not at all. Something... something... ball? [sneezes]\n[electricity crackles]\nFluttershy: [gasps] That's it! We have to go now!\nTwilight Sparkle: Lead the way, Fluttershy.\n[thud]\n[circling birdies]\nFluttershy: [groans]\n[door opens]\n[door closes]\n\n[thump]\n[music]\nTwilight Sparkle: So... [chuckles nervously] where do you think Meadowbrook lived?\nFluttershy: [yawns] I'm not sure. Maybe there's somepony we can ask.\nTwilight Sparkle: I think we might be the only ponies here.\n[beat]\nFluttershy: Wait! I recognize that tree! [gasps] Yes! This has to be it! It's just like the illustrations of her home!\nTwilight Sparkle: Anypony who lives in a tree is okay by me.\nFluttershy: [grunts] Phew. Well, if the doorway is sealed up, we'll just have to dig our way in. Back up, Twilight! I don't want you to get hurt! [grunting]\nTwilight Sparkle: Or we could try the handle.\nFluttershy: [laughs nervously] It really blends in with the bark.\nTwilight Sparkle: Easy to miss.\n[door opens]\nFluttershy: Wow. It looks like this place has been abandoned for years. [gasps] Twilight, look! It's the same kind of lilypad that gave Zecora Swamp Fever! Hmm. I wonder if Meadowbrook was looking for a cure for Swamp Fever, too. [gasps] Do you think she found it?\nTwilight Sparkle: I hope so, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.\n[loud squeak]\nTwilight Sparkle: That's exactly what I'm talking about. You're making your excited squeaking noise!\nFluttershy: Uh, I wasn't making my excited squeaking noise.\n[loud squeak]\nTwilight Sparkle and Fluttershy: [scream]\nCattail: [Cajun accent] Y'all can stop screamin' now. Didn't mean to scare ya. I do that a lot.\nTwilight Sparkle: Scare ponies or rock creepily in the dark?\nCattail: Well, both, I s'pose. Name's Cattail. Pleased to meet ya.\nFluttershy: Likewise, but, um, may I ask, why are you in Mage Meadowbrook's home?\nCattail: Oh, I take care of the place. I ain't much of a cleaner, but from what I hear, my kin wasn't neither. So I doubt they'd mind a few cobwebs in our ancestral home.\nFluttershy: [gasps] You're related to Mage Meadowbrook?\nCattail: Mm-hmm.\nFluttershy: Oh, my goodness, Twilight, we did it! Not only did we find Mage Meadowbrook's old house \u2013 we actually found one of her descendants!\nTwilight Sparkle: Honestly, I would not have guessed it.\nCattail: So you're lookin' for some kind o' cure, huh? Well, now, I know Meadowbrook was known to always be writin' in her journals. If she had the cure you want, I reckon that's where it'd be. Come on. I'll show ya the library.\nTwilight Sparkle: Library?! Now we're talkin'!\n[beat]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. Well... [chuckles] Libraries come in all shapes and sizes.\nFluttershy: This is good. It'll take us less time to go through everything.\n[thud]\nFluttershy: [blows air, reading] \"Today, my mom made me eat peas. Peas are yucky.\" And we can probably skip this one, unless she found a cure when she was a foal.\nTwilight Sparkle: [reading] \"I met a colt today. He pulled my mane, so I put a frog on his head.\" Also not helpful, but I do kinda want to see where it goes. [grumbles]\nFluttershy: Wait! Listen to this! [reading] \"Today, I tried again to brew an unsniffle elixir...\"\nFluttershy and Mage Meadowbrook: [crossfading] [Cajun accent] ...and I finally got it right!\nChipmunk: [sneezing]\n[sipping noise]\nChipmunk: [sighs]\nMeadowbrook's Mother: Meadowbrook, I think it's time you had this.\n[thumping]\nMage Meadowbrook: [gasps] My very own healer's mask! You think I'm ready, mother?\nMeadowbrook's Mother: Mm-hm.\n[knocking]\n[door opens]\nMeadowbrook's Mother: [gasps] What caused this?\n\nMage Meadowbrook: [narrating] Mother calls it Swamp Fever. We've been tryin' to find a cure, but it hasn't been easy.\n[lily puffs]\nMeadowbrook's Mother: [coughing]\n[knocking]\n[door opens]\nRoyal Pin: [coughs]\nMage Meadowbrook: [narrating] The fever spread like wildfire.\n[ponies sneezing and coughing]\nMeadowbrook's Mother: [coughing]\nMage Meadowbrook: [narrating] I fear if we don't find a cure soon, everypony will be in grave danger!\n\nMeadowbrook's Mother: [coughing]\nMage Meadowbrook: [narrating] With mother sick, I didn't think I'd ever find a cure. But starin' at those cursed flowers today, I saw somethin'.\n[flash bees buzzing]\n[lilies puffing]\nMage Meadowbrook: [gasps] Flash bees! [narrating] I realized the flowers' poison didn't affect the flash bees. And if they were immune to Swamp Fever, their honey could be the cure!\n[flash bees buzzing]\n[branch snaps]\n[flash bees buzzing]\n[zaps]\nMage Meadowbrook: [narrating] But they were so aggressive defendin' their hive, I didn't know how I was gonna get it!\n\n[flash bees buzzing]\nMage Meadowbrook: Here goes nothin'!\n\nMage Meadowbrook: [narrating] Today, I cured mother...\nFluttershy and Mage Meadowbrook: [crossfading] ...and the rest of the bayou!\nFluttershy: [reading] \"It was the greatest feeling I've ever experienced, and I promise to dedicate my life to curing ponies all over Equestria!\"\nCattail: And she did just that. Right up 'til she disappeared without a trace.\nFluttershy: So all we have to do is find those aggressive flash bees and get them to give us their honey! Of course, it doesn't say how she did that...\n[beat]\nFluttershy: What? Is my mane messy? I know I haven't slept in a while, but... [gasps] Oh, no! I've caught Swamp Fever!\n\nFluttershy: Huh?\n[thump, thump]\nTwilight Sparkle: [slightly muffled] Are you sure these are necessary?\nFluttershy: What?\nTwilight Sparkle: I said, are you sure these are necessary?\nFluttershy: Yes! I won't risk infecting you or Cattail!\nTwilight Sparkle: What you can't risk is getting any sicker! If you don't rest, your symptoms will only get worse!\nFluttershy: [coughs]\nCattail: Mm-hmm. You really should rest up before going up against those flash bees. They are nasty critters.\nFluttershy: Um, you don't know this about me, but I'm pretty good with animals. And besides, Dogtail\u2014\nCattail: Cattail.\nFluttershy: Um, Zecora is counting on me. I have to help her, just like Meadowbrook helped her mother and all those bayou ponies long ago!\nTwilight Sparkle: But Fluttershy, as much as Meadowbrook took care of other ponies, I'm sure she also took care of herself.\nFluttershy: [strained] You're not gonna change my mind, Twilight!\nCattail: Ooh. For bein' sick, she sure is strong.\n\nCattail: The flash beehive is just up yonder.\nTwilight Sparkle: Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?\nFluttershy: No! It's too dangerous, Twilight. Besides, I've already gotten one friend hurt. I won't let it happen to another. [exhales] Okay, Fluttershy, you can do this! [coughs]\n\nFluttershy: [panting] [straining] Mind over matter! [grunts] [straining, panting]\n[flash bees buzzing]\nFluttershy: Hello, flash bees! I was hoping I could get some of your honey.\n[flash bees buzzing]\nFluttershy: Oh! I see. You don't let others have any. Well, I'm sorry, but I really need it.\n[zap]\nFluttershy: [squeaks] I didn't want it to have to come to this, but I'll just have to use... the Stare!\n[flash bees buzzing]\n[zap, zap, zap]\nFluttershy: [shrieks] [coughs] You really are aggressive! [coughs] Oh, dear. [whimpers]\n\nFluttershy: [groans] What happened? Where am I?\nTwilight Sparkle: [exhales] I'm so glad you're okay. You're still in Meadowbrook's tree.\nCattail: You fainted, but Twilight shot some magic up and caught ya. It was crazy.\nFluttershy: Goodness gracious! [coughs] Have you heard from Zecora? Is she okay?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh...\nCattail: We got word your zebra friend has started sproutin' leaves.\nFluttershy: She's already turning into a tree?! I thought we'd have more time!\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, you've been asleep for three days.\nFluttershy: Three days?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Mm-hmm. You were asleep so long, we were afraid you wouldn't be able to move when you woke up. But thankfully, you just wore yourself down!\nFluttershy: Oh, dear. We have to get back to the hive! I've wasted so much time, and\u2014!\nCattail: Now hang on there, Fluttershy. Those flash bee critters are tricky.\nTwilight Sparkle: Cattail's right. I can't even use magic to calm them down. We'll have to find another way to get the honey.\nCattail: We've tried everything from disguises to things I won't even speak of. [shudders]\nTwilight Sparkle: He's been through a lot these past three days.\nFluttershy: Wait... Disguises...\n[flash bee buzzing]\nFluttershy: [gasps] That's it! I know how she did it! I know how Meadowbrook got the honey!\n\n[flash bees buzzing]\nFluttershy: This is how Meadowbrook got the honey from the flash bees!\nCattail: She threw a mask at 'em? I wouldn't recommend that.\nFluttershy: No. The male bees aren't aggressive around the queen bee, and this mask has the same stripes that she does.\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy, that's brilliant!\nFluttershy: [sneezes]\n[zap]\nCattail: Whoa!\nFluttershy: There's no time to waste!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hooves crossed!\nCattail: Oh, golly! I can't watch!\nFluttershy: [coughs] Mind over matter!\n[flash bees buzzing]\nFluttershy: [buzzing]\n[splat]\nFluttershy: Twilight... It's working!\n\nZecora: [gulps]\n[leaves rustling]\nTwilight Sparkle: I think she's cured now, Fluttershy.\nZecora: Ohhh, I do feel fine, and this honey is divine.\nFluttershy: Oh, you're rhyming again! Welcome back, my friend!\nZecora: Thank you, Fluttershy, for all you endured. If not for you, I would not be cured.\nFluttershy: Oh, if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have been sick in the first place.\nZecora: Regret is not what you should feel, because on this journey, you've learned a great deal.\nFluttershy: That's true. I certainly learned that if you don't take care of yourself, you won't be able to take care of anypony else. In fact, if I had rested like Twilight had suggested all along, maybe I would have thought to use Meadowbrook's mask sooner.\n[window squeaking]\nDr. Horse: [coughing]\n[bubbles popping]\nDr. Horse: Please tell me you found the cure!

We'll try somethin' else tomorrow.\nKettle Corn: But I like circle painting.\nScootaloo: And on the way to figuring out what you're meant to do, you'll find a ton more stuff you like.

We'd save time and they could help each other!\nScootaloo: Just like we used to!

I can't believe we got a cutie mark on the first day!\nApple Bloom: Yup. This camp was a pretty swell idea. Everypony's really enjoyed it.\nScootaloo: [sighs] Everypony except Rumble. He didn't have much luck with anything.\nSweetie Belle: Trying to find out what you're meant to do can be frustrating.

I don't want my cutie mark!\nSweetie Belle: [gasps] He said it again!\nScootaloo: Not wanting a cutie mark is like not wanting to breathe!\nSweetie Belle: Everypony wants to know what they're meant to do!\nRumble: Hmph! Not this pony.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Why?!\nRumble: Because cutie marks are silly, and... a-and they just force you into one thing your whole life!\nSweetie Belle: That's silly. Having a cutie mark doesn't mean you can't do other things.\nApple Bloom: Yeah! Our cutie marks are in helpin' other ponies with their cutie marks, but I still like makin' potions with Zecora.\nRumble: And when was the last time you did that?\nApple Bloom: Um... I-I-I think it was, uh... Well, we've been pretty busy helpin' other ponies lately.\nRumble: Oh. You mean doing the thing you got your cutie mark for? The thing you're stuck doing for the rest of your life?!\nSweetie Belle: Okay. Maybe we will be doing that more than anything else. But we love being Cutie Mark Crusaders!\nRumble: Well, that's fine for you, but I'm not gonna be put in a box!\nScootaloo: A blank flank who doesn't want a cutie mark? That's gotta be the strangest thing I've ever heard.\nApple Bloom: Granny always says, \"Some ponies have to find their own hay.\"\nScootaloo: Are you sure she didn't mean \"find their own way\"?\nApple Bloom: Oh. That would make more sense.\nSweetie Belle: I can't believe Rumble isn't interested in getting his cutie mark either, but we can't force him.\nScootaloo: And we've got a whole camp full of ponies who are interested in getting cutie marks.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Mm-hmm.\n\n[whoosh]\nRumble: [sighs] Here he comes. The fastest, most elite flyer in Equestria!\nThunderlane: Thunderlane!\nRumble: Whoa! [yelps] Urgh... I was gonna say me. You're not the only Pegasus in the family, you know.\nThunderlane: Oh, sorry, little brother. You're right. You might be the most elite flyer in Equestria some day. But for now, you should try other things, too! Speaking of which, aren't you supposed to be at camp?\nRumble: [scoffs] That camp is for losers who can't do anything.\nThunderlane: Great, so there's no pressure. You can try everything and not be worried about looking bad.\nRumble: I'm not worried about that. I just don't want to get a cutie mark in any of their ridiculous activities.\nThunderlane: Well, you're still going back tomorrow. You can't be a blank flank forever!\nRumble: Huh...\n\n[bell rings]\nSweetie Belle: All right, cutie mark campers, that's it for jam-making!\nPipsqueak: But this is fun, and I didn't get my cutie mark yet. What if I'm not good at anything else?\nScootaloo: You don't get a cutie mark just because you're good at something or even because you like it. There's more to it than that.\n[splat]\nKettle Corn: I'm real good at painting circles, but I got my cutie mark in haikus.\nSkeedaddle: Which is what I like! But... I'm still a blank flank like you.\nPipsqueak: So you can't get a cutie mark in something you like?\nApple Bloom: Now, we didn't say that.\nRumble: You don't have to!\nScootaloo: Rumble, you came back!\nRumble: Say bye-bye to painting circles. You'll be too busy haiku-ing from now on!\nKettle Corn: But... I like circles.\nApple Bloom: Come on, Rumble. That's not how cutie marks work.\nPipsqueak: So that's how cutie marks work?\nApple Bloom: Am I speakin' Olde Ponish?! I just said it wasn't!\n\n[Rumble]\n\"Cutie marks are great,\" they say\nPfft, yeah, right!\nThey make you special in your way\nBut that special mark that's just for you\nWill erase the stuff you liiiiiiike... to do\n\n\"Cutie marks are great,\" they say\nPfft, yeah, right!\nThey make you special in your way\nBut that special mark that's just for you\nWill erase the stuff you liiiiiiike... to do\n\nKettle Corn: So, no more painting?\nSkeedaddle: No more haiku?\nSweetie Belle: Rumble, stop!

Where do you think you're leadin' our campers?\nRumble: They're not your campers anymore! I'm starting a new camp!\n[digging noise]\nRumble: Everypony on this side of the line is in Camp Blank Flanks Forever!\n[foals cheering]\nScootaloo: Whoa-whoa! You can't be a blank flank forever!\n[foals gasping]\nRumble: That's just the kind of talk I'd expect to hear from Camp Cutie Mark! Which is why blank flanks need a camp where we can enjoy being blank flanks and appreciate our blank flankiness without being pressured to get a cutie mark!\n[foals cheering]\nScootaloo: Now hold on, everypony.\nRumble: Blank flanks forever!\nFoals: Blank flanks forever! Blank flanks forever! Blank flanks forever! Blank flanks forever! [cheering]\nSweetie Belle: What just happened?\nScootaloo: Has everypony gone mad?!\nApple Bloom: In a word: yes.\n\nBlank flanks!\n\nSweetie Belle: I just can't see what we did wrong. I thought everypony was having fun.\nApple Bloom: They were until that Rumble came and made a mess of things. What are they doing now?\nScootaloo: It looks like whatever they want.\nSweetie Belle: Honestly, it's not all that different from what they were doing here.\nApple Bloom: Then what was the point?\nScootaloo: Point is that Rumble is a madpony who must be stopped!\nSweetie Belle: Now calm down, Crusaders. We just need to talk to him again. The key is to remain calm.\n\nSweetie Belle: [yelling] Cutie marks... make you... special!\nRumble: By putting you in a special little box!\nSweetie Belle: [yelling] Special!\nRumble: Box!\nApple Bloom: Come on, Sweetie Belle. I think you've \"remained calm\" long enough.\n[foals chattering]\nSweetie Belle: Kettle Corn, you covered your cutie mark?!\nKettle Corn:\nI'm blank flank again,\nKeeping my options open.\nI'm more than haikus.\nSweetie Belle: You just haiku'd right then!\nRumble: Don't let them get in your head! You're an open-ended question! Blank flanks forever!\nFoals: Blank flanks forever!\n[click]\n\nI'm blank flank again,\nKeeping my options open.\nI'm more than haikus.\n\nPipsqueak: Blank flanks forever! Blank flanks forever!\n[horseshoes clinking]\nPipsqueak: Whoa! You're cracking great!\nSkeedaddle: Thanks! [gasps] Oh, no! What if I get a cutie mark in it?!\nRumble: Then you'll be stuck doing it forever! Blank flanks, no more potential cutie mark activities!\n[clink]\n[thunk]\n[thunk]\n[tik]\n[beat]\n[painting noises]\n\nSweetie Belle: Well, Cutie Mark Day Camp is a bust.\nApple Bloom: No, it isn't! It's a swell idea! We just can't seem to talk any sense into that... that Rumble.\n[rumble]\n[whoosh]\nScootaloo: Maybe we can't, but I bet I know somepony who can.\n\n[whoosh]\nThunderlane: Lemme get this straight. My little brother up-ended your entire camp? How in Equestria did he do that?\nSweetie Belle: Well, [inhales] [motor-mouth] it started when he couldn't toss a horseshoe or paddle a kayak or shoot an arrow or use a pencil, and we felt bad that he wasn't good at anything, but now he doesn't want a cutie mark at all because he's afraid he'll get stuck doing something he doesn't like forever, you know? [gasps]\nThunderlane: No, I don't. Rumble's good at all that stuff.\nApple Bloom: Well, that doesn't make a lick of sense. Unless... he was bein' bad at stuff on purpose!\nThunderlane: [sighs] I was afraid of this...\nScootaloo: Afraid of what?\nThunderlane: Ever since I became a Wonderbolt, Rumble's either watching me or trying to fly like me. He won't do anything else. That's why I thought your camp was such a good idea.\nScootaloo: I don't understand. If Rumble wants to be a Wonderbolt someday, what's wrong with that?\nThunderlane: Not a thing. But right now, he isn't even giving anything else a chance.\nApple Bloom: Sounds to me like Rumble isn't afraid of bein' put in a box at all.\nSweetie Belle: It doesn't?\nApple Bloom: Nope. I think Rumble's already picked out a box. He's afraid he'll get a cutie mark that'll keep him from it.\n[whoosh]\n[quick Wonderbolts motif]\n\n[birds chirping]\nPipsqueak: I don't know how to say this, Rumble, but Blank Flank Forever Camp is kinda...\nSkeedaddle: Boring?\nRumble: If we wanna stay blank flanks, we can't risk doing stuff.\nSkeedaddle: What if I get a cutie mark in being bored?\nScootaloo: Attention, blank flanks of Cutie Mark Day Camp!\n[thump]\n[foals chattering]\nSweetie Belle: The Cutie Mark Crusaders are pleased to announce today's special guest \u2013 Thunderlane!\n[whoosh]\nThunderlane: Hey, everypony! It's me!\n[whooshing]\n[foals ooh-ing and ahh-ing]\nApple Bloom: Anypony who's interested, gather 'round for a day of activities with a genuine Wonderbolt!\n[thump]\nSkeedaddle: Uh, sorry, Rumble. But cutie mark or not, I'm not missing out on this!\nFoals: Whoa!\n\n[foals straining]\n[clink, spinning]\n[zip]\n\nApple Bloom: All right, campers. It's time for our last activity of the day.\nSweetie Belle: A Wonderbolt obstacle course! Just like the one they'll fly through in their upcoming show!\nScootaloo: But on the ground, since not everypony has wings.\n[foals cheering]\n[bouncing noises]\nRumble: Thunderlane, aren't you gonna run the course?\nThunderlane: Nope! I know I'm a Wonderbolt and my cutie mark is all about moving fast, but I really like to cook!\nRumble: Since when?\nThunderlane: We take turns making the meals at Wonderbolts HQ. I didn't want to at first, but now I love it! I just wish I'd tried it sooner.\nRumble: You do?\nThunderlane: Of course! There's more to me than just flying, and I bet there's more to you, too.\n\nKettle Corn:\nObstacles are fun!\nRunning free through mud and dirt\nBeats circle painting!\nApple Bloom: That haiku pretty well sums it up.\nScootaloo: Looks like Thunderlane was right about the obstacle course getting Rumble to come back over.\nSweetie Belle: Hey, Rumble. Aren't you gonna do our Wonderbolt course?\nRumble: I'm cooking today. Maybe I'll do the course tomorrow.\nApple Bloom: So you're comin' back tomorrow?\nScootaloo: You're not worried about getting your cutie mark?\nRumble: Nah. I already know I'm a good flyer. It kinda runs in the family. I guess it's time to see what other stuff I can do.\nThunderlane: Hm-hmm.\n\nObstacles are fun!\nRunning free through mud and dirt\nBeats circle painting!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[music]\n[quill breaks]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh!\n[rumbling]\nSpike: [belches, sighs] Aw, thank goodness. I thought I had too many deep-fried gems.\nTwilight Sparkle: [mutters] It's from my parents! Spike, they won a zeppelin cruise and get to take the whole family! [sighs] I wish I had time to go with them, but there's just too many princess duties I have to take care of.\nSpike: Come on, Twilight. Even Princess Celestia takes a break sometimes, and she raises the sun.\n[beat]\nSpike: [grunt]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\nSpike: You need a vacation! I can keep track of the friendship log, boost community morale, and answer fan mail for a few days.\nTwilight Sparkle: But, Spike, you're as much a part of my family as anypony. I can't just leave you here to do all that work.\nSpike: [loudly] What?! I can't hear you! You're on vacation!\nTwilight Sparkle: I guess I could use a little time off from being a princess. You're the best, Spike!\nSpike: I know.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm gonna go pack everything neatly into one suitcase!\nSpike: Wait for it...\nTwilight Sparkle: [shouting] Cruises have activities, right?! I should probably make a schedule?!\nSpike: There it is.\n\n[theme song]\n\n[awed muttering]\nTwilight Velvet: Oh, gee. I am really looking forward to a relaxing vacation.\nNight Light: Watch out. She won't admit it, but when your mother says \"relaxing vacation\", she means \"doing something crazy\". Last time, she ended up bungee-jumping over Luna Bay!\nTwilight Velvet: What was that, hon?\nNight Light: Oh, I was, uh, just telling Twilight about my new, uh, bingo strategy book! It's a, heh, real page-turner!\nShining Armor: Oh, I can't wait to get on this zeppelin and fly like a Pegasus!\nTwilight Sparkle: Really? I remember you getting airsick on Admiral Fairweather's Wild Ride at Pony Island.\nShining Armor: Oh, please! I grew out of airsickness a long time ago.\n[feedback]\nIron Will: [over loudspeaker] I hope you ponies feel welcomed aboard, because you are!\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, that was an... assertive welcome.\n[whirring]\n\nSparkle family: [awed reactions]\nNight Light: Guess this is what it's like to be big-time prize winners. [laughs] I just wish I could remember what contest we won.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait. You don't know where this prize came from?\nTwilight Velvet: When somepony offers you a free vacation, you just sign the paperwork and don't ask questions!\nNight Light: Especially when it means we all get to fly off together. What should we do first?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, I did categorize the ship's activities and make a schedule organized by each of our interests. Dad, you're easy. Bingo competition right here.\nNight Light: Oh, I just love how the numbers and letters are organized in their little boxes. It's so satisfying.\nTwilight Sparkle: Shining Armor, they've got a tiny boat race in a tiny pool here.\nShining Armor: Aw, sis. Only you would remember I love tiny things.\nFlurry Heart: [babbles]\nTwilight Sparkle: And Cadance, there's a Peewee Princess Playtime here that Flurry's gonna love!\nFlurry Heart: [babbles]\nPrincess Cadance: Oh, wonderful!\nTwilight Velvet: Hmm. This barrel jumping at Neighagra Falls sounds interesting.\nTwilight Sparkle: Eh. I just want to see you all have a good time. And this works out perfectly, because we have room for the one thing I wanna do! Our ship passes the Frozen North at sunset, which is the only time you can see the astrological phenomenon known as the Northern Stars. It's like the stars are shooting out of the setting sun!\nRest of the Sparkle family: [interested reactions]\nPrincess Cadance: Well, we definitely don't want to miss that.\nTwilight Sparkle: Then it's settled. Hmm. But we don't have anything to do right now. Any suggestions?\n[feedback]\nIron Will: [over loudspeaker] Attention, cruise ponies! Don't let this zeppelin be a bore! Leave your room and see the tour!\nPrincess Cadance: A tour could be fun.\nSparkle family: [agreeing]\n\nShining Armor: I'm flying! I'm\u2014 [groans, gags]\nPrincess Cadance: I'm afraid Flurry may be airsick. Since I know that isn't a problem for you, would you mind taking her below?\nShining Armor: [grunts]\n[feedback]\nIron Will: [over loudspeaker] Far to our right, you can just make out the white tufts of Cloudsdale, where Princess Twilight Sparkle once toured the weather factory.\n[interested reactions]\nTwilight Sparkle: How'd he know that? And why announce it on a cruise?\n[indistinct conversations]\nPrincess Cadance: Why don't we move to the other side of the deck?\n[indistinct conversations continue]\nIron Will: [over loudspeaker] We are now high enough to see all of Canterlot, even the royal tree where Princess Twilight and her brother Shining Armor were born!\nTwilight Sparkle: What? That's not right.\n[clamoring]\nTwilight Velvet: [gasps] Oooh!\nNight Light: Let's get down for that!\nTwilight Velvet and Night Light: [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Um, you guys know that's not where we were born.

Us, too.\nIron Will: [over loudspeaker] On our route north, we will pass the spires of the Crystal Empire, where Princess Cadance rescued her Alicorn baby Spike from a monster made of fire!\nPrincess Cadance: Well, that doesn't even make sense.\nNight Light: Well, \"Royal Grandparents\" sounds a bit fancy, but of course you can take our picture.\n[camera shutters clicking]\nTwilight Sparkle: What?!\nCruise Ponies: [excited sounds]\nPrincess Cadance: Uh... Oh!\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, that's it! Does anypony know where the cruise announcer is?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Excuse me, sir.\nIron Will: You can call Iron Will \"Iron Will\"!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] What are you doing here? And why do you keep announcing random things about me and my family?\nIron Will: The assertiveness seminar market dried up, so Iron Will started a new career organizing themed vacation packages!\nTwilight Sparkle: And the theme of this vacation is...\nIron Will: [over loudspeaker] Everypony, stomp your hooves if you are here for the premiere Cruise of the Princesses Experience!\n[clamoring, hooves stomping]\n\n[ponies clamoring]\n[door closes]\nTwilight Sparkle: Iron Will, I'm not sure it was entirely honest of you to offer this cruise to my family without telling us that ponies bought tickets just to see Cadance and me!\nIron Will: Iron Will outlined all the details of the cruise in the Prize Acceptance and Consent Form that you signed.\nTwilight Velvet: Well, when somepony offers you a free vacation, who reads the fine print?\nIron Will: Iron Will prides himself on providing a quality vacation experience. But if Twilight Sparkle and her family don't want it, Iron Will can cancel the cruise and break the hearts of every princess-adoring pony on board.\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\n\"Sunny Side\": I love you, Princess Twilight!\nPrincess Cadance: As much as I want a family vacation, I don't think I could entertain all these cruise ponies. My hooves are pretty full taking care of Flurry Heart.\nTwilight Velvet: I guess we were just so excited by the idea of a family cruise.\nNight Light: [sighs heavily] All right. I guess we better turn this ship around.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait! Iron Will, what if I offered you a deal? If I agree to do whatever princess activities you want, will you promise that my family gets to do the activities they want?\nShining Armor: Sis, you don't have to do that. We want you to enjoy yourself, too.\nFlurry Heart: [babbles]\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't want the vacation to end now or let down all these ponies who were looking forward to seeing us. So what do you say, Iron Will? Do we have a deal?\nIron Will: Princess Twilight has a deal!\nTwilight Sparkle: Great! So it looks like we have some time before Dad plays Bingo.\nIron Will: Actually, we have just enough to pick the winner of our grand-prize raffle.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. Well... [chuckles] who doesn't like prizes?\n\nIron Will: All right, cruise ponies! When the zeppelin flies, it's time for a prize!\n[ponies cheering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you all for being so gracious and respectful to me and my family. And now, without further ado, the winner is...\n[papers rustling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Star Tracker!\n[hooves clopping]\nTwilight Sparkle: Congratulations, Star Tracker! Enjoy your prize! Okay, Dad! Bingo time!\n[bump!]\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh... Oh. I'm sorry.

[chuckles nervously]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, well... I guess you should come with us, honorary family member.\nNight Light: Sure! [laughs] There's always room at the bingo table!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [amplified] Ahem! Is everypony ready?\nNight Light: Sure are, sweetie! Give that cage a whirl!\nTwilight Sparkle: Dad? [amplified] What did you say?\nStar Tracker: He... He said to, uh, uh, give it a-a whirl. Heh.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. Um, thanks.\n[sloooop]\n[rattling]\nTwilight Sparkle: [amplified] I-19!\nNight Light: Hey, hey! Now we're talkin'! This Princess Bingo is great!\nTwilight Sparkle: Did you get that one, Dad? [amplified] Can anypony tell me how my dad is doing?\nStar Tracker: He, uh, he said the Princess Bingo is, uh, great. Heh.\nPonies: [chanting] Princess Bingo! Princess Bingo! Princess Bingo! [continues underneath]\nStar Tracker: Twilight is my favorite time of day. [laughs] And it's also your name.

Just made it!\n[squeak]\nTwilight Sparkle: And I'm ready to give you the tiny boat race of your life!\nShining Armor: [whinnies, sick noises]\nTwilight Sparkle: Are you sure you're not airsick, big brother?\nShining Armor: [queasily] No way. How can I be airsick? I'm in the water, so it totally cancels out! [gurgles]\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't think that's how it works. But I'm ready if you are.\nIron Will: Technically, Princess Twilight Sparkle should officiate the princess paddle boat race.\nTwilight Velvet: Well, I suppose I could could race your brother.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. Well, as long as Shining Armor gets to race, I'm happy.\n[magic zap]\n[cameras clicking]\n[thump]\nStar Tracker: [nervous noises] S-Sorry.\nTwilight Sparkle: [inhales]\nStar Tracker: [nervous] I'm gonna write about this race tonight in my journal!

[laughs]\nTwilight Velvet: [cheers]\n[splashing]\nTwilight Velvet: Oh, my word, that was exciting! Wasn't it, son? [laughing]\nShining Armor: [nauseous] Just so everypony knows, I'm getting out of this boat because of how not sick I feel.\n[splash]\nTwilight Velvet: Aww, that's all right, dear. We'll take you back to the room.\n[squeak]\nIron Will: [through microphone] That was just the first heat! Of ten!\n[abs popping]\nIron Will: Now, who's ready to see a princess face when they win their race?!\n[cruise ponies cheering]\n\n[babies gurgling]\nFlurry Heart: [giggling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Cadance, I'm so glad you got in the Peewee Princess Playtime!\nPrincess Cadance: Flurry is having a wonderful time.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's great. I'm just on my way to take some old-time Appleloosan photos!\nStar Tracker: Themed photoshoots are the best. [nervous noise]\nTwilight Sparkle: And then do a quick question-and-answer session on becoming an Alicorn before Mom's barrel ride at Neighagra Falls! I really hope I don't miss that.\nPrincess Cadance: Twilight, are you sure you don't mind doing all of these princess activities?\nTwilight Sparkle: Mind? What? Absolutely not. I mean, you guys are having fun, right? [sighs] Besides, I have to make sure these cruise ponies are happy if I want to be a good princess.\nPrincess Cadance: You're already a good princess, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: Honestly, as long as I get to see the Northern Stars tonight with everypony, I'll be happy. But right now, I gotta go take some pictures. See you later!\n\"Sun Cloche\": Why don't you play and make a princess friend?\n[babies gurgling]\nPrincess Cadance: Uh... I am so sorry, everypony, but it looks like Flurry needs her nap.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, why did that last question have to be a two-parter? I just hope I have time for one barrel ride with Mom!\n[thunk]\n[crunch]\nTwilight Velvet: [gasps] Neighagra Falls was amazing! The endless open air, the water in my mane! Oh! The small confines of the barrel!\nNight Light: [chuckles] Another relaxing vacation in the books, hon. [kiss]\n[splash]\nTwilight Velvet: Oh, honey, I know you're disappointed, but we waited as long as we could. Maybe you should take a break from these princess things.\nTwilight Sparkle: Disappointed? No! I've just been answering some detailed questions about Alicorns! You know how much I love details!\nTwilight Velvet: I just don't want you to forget. It's your vacation, too.\nTwilight Sparkle: How can I when it's a totally successful vacation?\nNight Light: All right. Well, uh, we can't wait to see those Northern Stars!\nIron Will: Iron Will lived up to his side of the bargain, and Princess Twilight only has one more thing to do for the day.\n\nIron Will: [through microphone] It's your last chance. Come get in line if you want the princess to sign!\nCruise ponies: [excited chattering]\n[time passing music]\nCruise ponies: [excited squealing]\nFan: [indistinct] I'm never letting this go!\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] How long have you been waiting?\nStar Tracker: [nervous noises]\n[distant whooshing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, no. What time is it?! [panicked noises, gasps]\nNight Light: [in middle distance] Wow. [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: [crying]\n\nPrincess Cadance and Flurry Heart: [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: [tearing up] I missed them? I missed the Northern Stars? [crying]\nPrincess Cadance: You were right, Twilight. They were breathtaking.\nFlurry Heart: [gurgles]\nNight Light: Aw, we wish you'd been here to see it, sweet-pea, but we're sure you're making a whole bunch of cruise ponies happy.\nStar Tracker: [laughs] I'm so happy I could cry!\nTwilight Sparkle: [suddenly indignant] Oh, yeah. The cruise ponies are happy. My family is happy. Even Iron Will is happy.\n[crunch]\nTwilight Sparkle: You know who isn't happy? Me!\n[smack]\n[crunch]\nStar Tracker: [yelp of pain] Augh, my hoof!\nTwilight Sparkle: [insincerely] I'm sorry. But maybe that wouldn't have happened if you weren't practically standing on my tail! Not even my real family stands so close! Rrgh!\n[thump]\n\nPrincess Cadance: Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: I only made that deal with Iron Will so my family and the cruise ponies could have the vacation they wanted.\nPrincess Cadance: What about what you wanted?\nTwilight Sparkle: I just want everypony to be happy.\nPrincess Cadance: Well, sometimes ponies want more from a princess than you can give, and it can be hard to know where to draw the line.\nTwilight Sparkle: You seem to know pretty well.\nPrincess Cadance: Once I had Flurry Heart, the line was easier for me to see. You will always have obligations as a princess, but you also have an obligation to yourself.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] You're right. I think I need to set some boundaries. But first, I owe somepony an apology.\n\nTwilight Velvet: Aww, how's that, dearie?\nStar Tracker: Better. Thanks.\n[door opens]\nStar Tracker: [panicking] Uh, I think I should go!\nTwilight Sparkle: No, Star Tracker. You should stay. I have something to tell you. All of you. I'm glad you all got to do the things you wanted, but I should have stood up for myself so that I could do what I wanted, too. [to Star Tracker] It wasn't fair of me to lash out at you. If I felt like you were standing too close, I should have said something. I'm sorry. [to everypony] What do you say we do something off the schedule?\nEverypony else: [gasps]\nStar Tracker: Who are you?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yup! We're gonna do something I want us to do, as a family. Honorary members, too.\n\nShining Armor: [gags]\nTwilight Sparkle: [giggles]\nFlurry Heart: [giggles]\nEverypony: [laughs]\nNight Light: Now that's cold! This is more like it!\nStar Tracker: You and your family have been really kind to include me, but you deserve your own vacation together. [laughs nervously] And I'm really glad we met, too!\nTwilight Sparkle: Ohhh!\n[splat]\n[boing]\nIron Will: [through microphone] Attention, cruise ponies! If it's your dream, come to the deck for ice cream!\nCruise ponies: [excited chatter]\nStar Tracker: Oh, no! Leave the princess alone!\nIron Will: What did you say to Iron Will?\nTwilight Sparkle: It's okay, everypony. [through microphone] [clears throat] First, I want to thank all of you for coming. It means a lot that you'd spend your hard-earned bits just to be with us. But I honestly came on this cruise to take some time off from being a princess. I'm just a pony, too, after all. And even though I want everypony here to be happy, I'd really like to spend the rest of the cruise relaxing with my family.\n\"Sunny Side\": Of course, Princess Twilight.\n\"Sun Cloche\": But why was this trip advertised as a Cruise of the Princesses if you just wanted to get away?\nIron Will: [whistling] Iron Will's Cruise of the Princesses makes no guarantees as to the participation of actual princesses.\n[pages rustling]\nCruise pony: What?!\nCruise ponies: [angry chatter]\nIron Will: But Iron Will learned his lesson before. Satisfaction not guaranteed. No refuuuuuuunds!\n[ponies gasping]\n[guitar riff]\nShining Armor: Wow. He may be pushy and manipulative, but nopony can say that minotaur isn't prepared.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: There's still plenty of activities. We pass Fillydelphia on the way back. I could give Flurry Heart a quick history tour.\nPrincess Cadance: That's very thoughtful. But right now, the family and I have something scheduled for you.\nNight Light: Behold! The Northern Stars!\nFlurry Heart: [gurgling]\nTwilight Sparkle: You did all this for me? This is amazing! Thank you. And Shining Armor, I can't believe you're up there even though you're airsick!\nShining Armor: I am not air\u2014 [gurgles] [nauseous] Oh, okay. Maybe I'm not feeling great!\nFlurry Heart: [laughing]\nTwilight Velvet: Oh, dear!\nNight Light: Whatever you say.\nPrincess Cadance: [giggling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Now this is the only activity I need.\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nPinkie Pie: Okay. All we need is a dot of salt, a dab of sugar, and a spritz of ginger.\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh... Are those real measurements? How do you keep track without a recipe?\nPinkie Pie: Pie baking is more art than science. And this will be my masterpiece! It's to celebrate Rainbow Dash's seventy-third Wonderbolt training session!\nTwilight Sparkle: Seventy-third? That's specific.\nPinkie Pie: I know! The pie is blueberry because Wonderbolt outfits are blue. The crust is rainbow, for obvious reasons. But the most special part is the seventy-three super secret sweets and spices that represent each training session! [giggles] Could you please pass the... [quickly] brown sugar, pink sugar, sweetroot, apple jelly, berry mash, and a towel?\n[splattering]\nTwilight Sparkle: You sure are going to a lot of trouble for Rainbow Dash's pie.\nPinkie Pie: Phew! That's because I know how much she loves them! My pies are her favorite! It's worth all the trouble to see her happy. Now I'm going to need some cocoa powder, cocoa flakes\u2014 Ooh! Cocoa bar! [chomp] [mouthful] Want some?\nTwilight Sparkle: Isn't that for the pie?\nPinkie Pie: [gulps, laughing] Oh, Twilight! That's hilarious! You don't mix chocolate into a blueberry pie! This is my mid morning, pie-making chocolate fuel that keeps this pie baking train chugging down the tracks! [chomp, babbles, gulp] Break time's over! Now let's finish this pie! Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, choo-choo!\nTwilight Sparkle: [chuckles]\n\n[theme song]\n\nSpitfire: Good training, everypony. Nice work, Crash. You really added that sparkle to that pressure diamond-drop.\nRainbow Dash: [gasps]\nPinkie Pie: Surprise! Happy seventy-third Wonderbolt training session! [blows party horn]\nRainbow Dash: My seventy-third training session? That's specific.\nPinkie Pie: I know! I'm just so proud and happy for you, and I've been counting all your training sessions, and I was going to wait until your hundredth, but I got too excited, and I know how much you love pie, so happy seventy-third training session!\nRainbow Dash: Whaaa?! You didn't have to do this.\nPinkie Pie: I know I didn't have to, but I reeeally wanted to! [squealing] Have a bite.\nRainbow Dash: Whoa! What's that?! Huh. Guess it was nothing. But wow, heh. This pie is the best I've ever had! Mmm! Is that cinnamon?\nPinkie Pie: I knew you'd love it! Have more. I made the whole thing for you.\nRainbow Dash: Really? Oh, that's so great! But I need to go change. A-And then I have to take Tank to the vet. Heh. His sensitive tortoise tummy's been acting up again. Do you mind if I take this pie with me?\nPinkie Pie: Of course not! I gotta get back to my shift at Sugarcube Corner anyway. Congratulations again!\nRainbow Dash: Heh. Thanks.\n[trash cart squeaking]\nPinkie Pie: [sighs] I knew she'd love it. [gasps deeply] Is that...? Is that...?!\n[zoom]\nPinkie Pie: Stop!\n[clattering]\nPinkie Pie: You didn't see a blueberry rainbow-crust seventy-three-ingredient pie with a slice eaten out of it in here, did you?\nJanitor Pony: Uh... n-no?\nPinkie Pie: Right. Of course you didn't. That would be ridiculous. Because I made it for Rainbow Dash, and she loves my pies. She would never throw them away like trash in the trash with other trash, right? Right?!\nJanitor Pony: Um... riiight?\n\nPinkie Pie: Hmmm... That pie couldn't have been the one I made. I must be seeing things. I did have a lot of chocolate this morning. [chomp, gulps] But what if I wasn't seeing things? What if that was my pie? [scoffs] That would be bananas! [chuckles, laughing crazily] [gasps] Unless Rainbow Dash's been replaced by an imposter who throws delicious pies away!\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: Or... has she been brainwashed by a pie-hating evil queen?\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: You make a good point. Rainbow Dash is too stubborn to be brainwashed. Plus she hates washing. Hmm. There's something else going on here. Let's look up a few of the more recent pies I've made for her. The boysenberry pie I made for her birthday... and her three half-birthday lemon meringues... and the \"It's Not Your Birthday But Here's a Pie Anyway Day\" custard pie! She ate all of these... Right?\n\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] Another pie!? Thank you so much! Whoa! What's that?!\n[zip!]\nRainbow Dash: [chewing noises] Huh. Guess it was nothing. Heh-heh.\n\nRainbow Dash: Awesome! Three lemon meringues? Uh... Hey, what's that over there?\n[thunk, thunk, thunk]\nRainbow Dash: [chewing noises] Oh, never mind. Heh. Great pies!\n\nPinkie Pie: Happy \"It's Not Your Birthday But Here's a Pie Anyway\" Day!\nRainbow Dash: Thank you! No way! Check that out!\n[thunk]\n[clang]\nShoeshine: Oh! It's not even my birthday!\nRainbow Dash: Oh, sorry. Guess it was nothing. [slurp] Mmm! But that custard was everything!\n\nPinkie Pie: Have I ever really seen Rainbow Dash eat one of my pies? And do I always look when somepony points behind me? What's there?! Heh. Good one. But I need answers.\n\nPinkie Pie: I've sent Rainbow Dash a pie every month she's been a Wonderbolt, and you're telling me you've never seen her eat one?\nSpitfire, Soarin, and Fleetfoot: Uhhh...\nSpitfire: Uh, affirmative. Or, uh, negative. Um... I-I-I mean, she wasn't seen eating one.\nPinkie Pie: Hmm... Interesting. Very interesting.\nSpitfire: Are we under investigation?\nPinkie Pie: As chief detective on the pie case, I've labeled you all ponies-of-interest. So it's best you tell me everything you know.\nSpitfire: Well, we have been getting mysterious monthly pie donations.\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] Would you be able to pick these pies out of a line up?\n\n[ceiling fan creaking]\nPinkie Pie: I hear Rainbow Dash's pet tortoise Tank has been having tummy troubles. When did it start?\nDr. Fauna: About a week ago. Poor Tank had all the telltale signs of sugar overload \u2013 jittery shell, sleeplessness, reptilian indigestion.\nPinkie Pie: Hmmm... And this all happened the day after I made Rainbow Dash a \"Thanks For Lending Me Your Jacket\" peach pie. It seems the pieces of the puzzle are plopping into place, but the picture isn't pretty. [gasps] Note to self \u2013 P. Alliteration Pie. Is that everything, Doctor?\nDr. Fauna: Well, there's also this.\nPinkie Pie: Interesting. Did you have the lab analyze the flavor of that pie?\nDr. Fauna: No. But you know, Miss Cheerilee was in here not long ago. The class hamster was having similar symptoms. [gasps] Perhaps it's a pie pandemic!\nPinkie Pie: Perhaps. And I just might know Pony Patient Zero!\n[pipe bubbling]\n\nCheerilee: Dr. Fauna's right. I do always have to remind the foals and fillies not to share the pies with the class hamster. Animals just can't digest pony food.\nPinkie Pie: Indeed. But where do these pies come from?\nCheerilee: Well, they're from Rainbow Dash. She drops off her \"Day After Rainbow Dash's Half-Birthday\" pie every year.\nPinkie Pie: Did you say the day after her half-birthday?! Very, very interesting. Because I give her a pie on her half-birthday every year! And I have a feeling it's the same pie.\nCheerilee: Well, wherever it comes from, the students just love it.\nPinkie Pie: I'm so glad. At least I can be sure somepony is.\n\nPinkie Pie: She didn't eat the blueberry. She didn't eat the banana. She didn't eat the cream, and she didn't eat the chocolate. She didn't eat any of 'em! Why?! And don't tell me this all just started recently! It's been going on for years! Cheerilee said so herself. If there's one thing I know, you can't escape the truth!\n[dings]\n[whoosh!]\n[lightning strikes]\nPinkie Pie: Rainbow Dash doesn't like pie, and she's been lying to me about it the whole time! [screams]\n\n[door opens]\nPinkie Pie: [muffled scream]\nApplejack: Pinkie Pie?! Pinkie Pie!\n[clicking]\n[ka-chunk!]\nApplejack: Whooooaaaa! [grunting] Oh. Party-planning cave. Right. You okay? Or are you just screamin' for fun?\nPinkie Pie: Screaming is fun. But I'm not okay! I've been making Rainbow Dash pies for years, but she doesn't even like them. She's been lying to me!\nApplejack: But everypony loves your pies. They're the greatest thing since sliced apples.\nPinkie Pie: Thank you!\nApplejack: And I could swear I've seen her eat one of your pies before.\nPinkie Pie: Have you reeeaaally?\nApplejack: Um, I... thought I had. That's why I said it?\nPinkie Pie: Are you sure?\nApplejack: Maybe I haven't...?\nPinkie Pie: Exactly! Because it's all been a sham! Rainbow Dash has been laughing at my pies behind my back and scheming of a way to get rid of them for years!\n\n[clouds rumbling]\n[thunder]\nRainbow Dash: Bring forth the worst-tasting food in all of Equestria!\n[carts rolling]\nRainbow Dash: And now I will destroy Pinkie Pie's horrid abominations, freeing the land of these disgusting pies forever!\nPinkie Pie: Nooooooo!\n[magic zaps]\nRainbow Dash: Good riddance, strawberry cream and peaches 'o plenty! Begone, apple crumble and lemon surprise!\n[magic zaps]\nRainbow Dash: Gone! Gone! Gone! [laughing evilly]\n[thunder]\n\nApplejack: I really don't think that's what's happening.\nPinkie Pie: I don't think so either. I know so.\nApplejack: Well, I've got just the thing to get your mind off all this madness. We've had a great apple harvest, so I was hopin' you could whip up a few of your delicious pies.\nPinkie Pie: Yes. I will make pies. Lots of pies. I'm going to make Rainbow Dash so many pies, it'll force her to admit the truth. Or I'll catch her in the act of getting rid of them. Operation: \"Pie of Lies\" is a go. Thanks, Applejack. I knew I could count on you to come up with a plan.\nApplejack: I don't think that's what I did. Also, uh... how do you get out of here?\n\nRainbow Dash: [snoring]\nPinkie Pie: Surprise!\nRainbow Dash: [yelps] W-W-What's happening?!\nPinkie Pie: Happy unofficial \"Wake Your Friends Up\" Day!\nRainbow Dash: Ugh. I've never heard of \"Wake Your Friends Up\" Day.\nPinkie Pie: Well, it's unofficial. But I made you your favorite pie in celebration! Ta-da! Gifts are the second most important part of \"Wake Your Friends Up\" Day.\nRainbow Dash: What's the first most important part?\nPinkie Pie: Accepting the gifts and enjoying them immediately.\nRainbow Dash: Uh... Well, I'm sorry I forgot about \"Wake Your Friends Up\" Day. Let me make it up to you. Here!\nPinkie Pie: [sneezes]\n[thudding]\nTank: [chomp]\nPinkie Pie: [sneezes] The pie! Where'd it go?!\nRainbow Dash: What do you mean where did it go? Heh-heh. Mmm-mmm.\nPinkie Pie: How\u2014?! Where\u2014?! When\u2014?! [distressed sounds]\n\nPinkie Pie: Congratulations on your seventy-fourth Wonderbolt training session! Here's a pie. Now eat it!\nRainbow Dash: Okay, this is getting a little out of hoof. I haven't even trained yet.\nPinkie Pie: Well, I wanted to pre-celebrate because I already know how great you're gonna do. Eat the pie!\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie, look out!\nPinkie Pie: I'm not gonna fall for\u2014 [screams] Whoa! [grunting]\n[splat]\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie! Are you okay?!\nPinkie Pie: [grunting] Get me down!\nEMT Pony: Sorry, ma'am, but we have to make sure you didn't sustain any internal injuries.\nPinkie Pie: But the pie! What happened to the pie?!\nRainbow Dash: Oh! The pie was delicious! You just get better!\nPinkie Pie: Noooooooo!\n\nPinkie Pie: [unconvincing] Ah! Somepony help me! Rainbow Dash, thank goodness you're here! I was trying to fix the top pie on my pie pyramid, but the whole thing became unstable. And there's only one way to save me! You have to eat the pies!\nRainbow Dash: Don't worry, I got ya!\nPinkie Pie: Oh, right. Or you could save me that way.\nRainbow Dash: You gotta be more careful, okay?\nPinkie Pie: [growls] Rrgh!\n[thud]\n[pies splat]\n\nPinkie Pie: Rainbow Dash! I wanted to thank you for saving me from the pie pyramid, so have a pie! Have three! Have fifteen! I know how much you love them! Now eat up!\nRainbow Dash: Uh... Thanks!\n[fillies laughing]\nRainbow Dash: I can't wait to eat [loudly] all these pies!\n[fillies clamoring]\nPinkie Pie: What!? Where did they\u2014?! How did you\u2014?!\nRainbow Dash: Delicious! You did it again, Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie: [growls]\n\nPinkie Pie: Rainbow Dash, there you are! I made a pie for everypony, and you're the only one who hasn't eaten hers yet. So here. Your pie. For you to eat. Now.\nRainbow Dash: Are you okay? You seem to be staring more than usual.\nPinkie Pie: I just really like to watch others enjoy my pies. [unhinged giggling]\n[beat]\nRainbow Dash: You sure you don't have to blink?\nPinkie Pie: Me? Nope. I'm not much of a blinker. [licking] Don't mind me. Go ahead and take a bite.\nRainbow Dash: Well... Do I want to take a big bite or a small bite...? I just don't know... Or maybe medium? No, no, no. Definitely not medium.\nPinkie Pie: [panting] [strained] Just try some.\nRainbow Dash: Ahhhh... Do you have any milk?\nPinkie Pie: [grinding teeth]\n[deep bell ring]\nCherry Berry: [chomps slowly]\n[bird flaps slowly]\n[whipping]\nRainbow Dash: [slurps]\n[bell rings]\nRainbow Dash: Ah, never mind. Your pies are just too good to resist.\nPinkie Pie: What?! No! No! That's it! I can't take it!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, everything okay, Pinkie?\nPinkie Pie: No! Everything is not okay! You hate my pies!\nRainbow Dash: What are you talking about?\nPinkie Pie: You know exactly what I'm talking about! I saw what you did! Well, I didn't see what you did. But I know that you've been fake-eating my pies! You threw away the pie I made for your seventy-third Wonderbolt training session, and I know you secretly somehow got rid of all the other pies I gave you! Admit it!\nRainbow Dash: That's crazy! What do you think I did? Somehow make them all disappear into thin air?\n[splat]\nRainbow Dash: [nervous chuckle] Okay. So maybe I made one of them disappear into thin air.\n\nPinkie Pie: How could you?!\nRainbow Dash: What?! I, uh... I-I just wanted to share these amazing pies with the folks of Cloudsdale! So I, uh... I was trying to send them up via... balloon mail.\nPinkie Pie: But you just said they were delicious.\nRainbow Dash: Well, obviously that's because... I have amnesia!\n[beat]\nRainbow Dash: I've been brainwashed!\n[beat]\nRainbow Dash: I-It's Opposite Day?\nPinkie Pie: Your memory is working fine, you hate washing, and I know today's not Opposite Day because I baked you a pie for it every year. A pie that you'd probably just throw away. Or give to charity. Or destroy with your laser eyes while laughing at me!\nRainbow Dash: Laser eyes?\nPinkie Pie: Oh! Oh! So you admit it!\nRainbow Dash: What? No! I can explain!\nPinkie Pie: I don't want to hear it!\n[pie tin clangs]\n\nRainbow Dash: She won't listen to me. She won't let me apologize. [sighs] I feel terrible.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, you have been lying to her. To all of us, actually.\nApplejack: Yeah. Is there anything else you're lyin' about that we should know?\nRainbow Dash: No! Well, not that I can think of off the top of my head. Is it my fault that I don't like pies? And not just Pinkie's pies. All pies! I know how much she loves making pies, and if I told her I didn't like them, it would have crushed her.\nApplejack: Uh, you kinda crushed her anyway.\nRainbow Dash: Oh, but I...! [stutters, sighs] You're right. I guess I should've just eaten the pies in the first place. [gasps] Wait! That's it! I know how I can make it up to her!\n\nPinkie Pie: Pee-yew! Gummy, is that you?\n[thud]\nPinkie Pie: Huh. What is that? Oh. It's you.\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie Pie, wait! I know now that I should've been honest with you from the start, because lying to your friends is wrong. And because getting rid of all those pies was a giant hassle. I mean, do you have any idea how many pies you've made for me over the years?\nPinkie Pie: Yes, I know exactly how many. I have a very detailed pie-ling system.\nRainbow Dash: Of course you do. The point is I thought the hassle was worth it just to spare your feelings, but I was wrong. So to make up for it, I made this pie for you. Well, I guess I made it for me. To eat in front of you. Point is I'm eating this pie for friendship!\nPinkie Pie: Wait. That smelly circular monstrosity is a pie?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! I know I can't go back and eat all the pies you made for me in the past, so instead I'm going to eat this one giant one for you now. So here I go.\n[splat]\n[splat]\nRainbow Dash: Ahhhh...\nPinkie Pie: Wait! I can't watch you do this!\n[clattering]\nPinkie Pie: I mean, is that crust or some kind of concrete?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, honestly, I have no idea.\nPinkie Pie: Oh, I can't believe you're willing to eat this terrible pie for me. It's ridiculous, and this whole thing is overly complicated, and... [sighs] I think I finally understand why you lied.\n\nRainbow Dash: Whoa! What's that?!\n[zip!]\nRainbow Dash: [chewing noises] Huh. Guess it was nothing. Heh-heh.\nPinkie Pie: [squeals] I'm so glad you enjoyed my pies!\n\n[thunk, thunk, thunk]\nRainbow Dash: [chewing noises] Oh, never mind. Heh. Great pies!\nPinkie Pie: [high-pitched squeal]\n\nRainbow Dash: No way! Check that out!\n[thunk]\n[clang]\nShoeshine: Oh! It's not even my birthday!\nRainbow Dash: Oh, sorry. Guess it was nothing. [slurp] Mmm! But that custard was everything!\nPinkie Pie: Seeing you eat my pies makes me the happiest pony in all of Equestria!\nRainbow Dash: Heh. I know it does.\n\nPinkie Pie: You did a lot of ridiculous and overly complex things to get rid of my pies because it made you happy to see me happy. Just like I went to a lot of effort to make you the pies because it made me happy to see you happy.\nRainbow Dash: Yes!\nPinkie Pie: And if you're willing to go through all of that, it really shows how much you're willing to do for your friends.\nRainbow Dash: Aw, shucks. It was nothing.\nPinkie Pie: Now get out of that thing and give me a hug!\n[splat]\nPinkie Pie: Just remember. In the future, you can always be honest with me.\nApplejack: Uh, I could've told her that.\nRainbow Dash: [straining] Heh. Cool. H-How about this? Your hugs are too tight.\nPinkie Pie: [laughing] No, they're not.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nStarlight Glimmer: Oooh! Excuse me.

I probably have more in common with Twilight than any pony in Equestria!\nStarlight Glimmer: Right...\nSunburst: [sighs] Anyway, I better get some sleep. [yawns] Ponyville might be small, but there's a lot to do. Maybe we should ask Twilight what she recommends we see!\nStarlight Glimmer: Um... sure.\nSunburst: Great! Good night, Starlight.\nStarlight Glimmer: Um...\n[door closes]\nStarlight Glimmer: ...Good night.\n\n[door opens]\nStarlight Glimmer: [singsong] Knock, knock!\nSunburst: [yelps] Oh. Hi, Starlight. [yawns] Is it morning already?\nStarlight Glimmer: Yup! Maybe a bit early, but like you said, there's a lot to see in Ponyville.\nSunburst: Uh... Right. Okay.\nStarlight Glimmer: Plus, I couldn't really sleep. I just kept thinking about all the stuff we have in common and how much fun we'll have today.\nSunburst: Great. Uh, is Twilight up yet?\nStarlight Glimmer: Actually, I'm pretty sure she's busy with princess stuff today.\nSunburst: Oh. [yawns]\nStarlight Glimmer: But I've got a full day of stuff planned. Just you and me.\nSunburst: Uh, great. Um, would you mind turning around or preferably... leaving the room so I could get changed?\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh! Right! Sorry. [laughs nervously]\n[door closes]\n\n[fly buzzing]\nStarlight Glimmer: One genuine Sweet Apple Acres apple tree! Because we used to drink so much apple juice as foals?\nSunburst: Uh, I don't remember that.\nStarlight Glimmer: Really? I mean, it was all we drank. Here. Try an apple. I bet that'll jog your memory. [grunts]\n[thunk]\nTrixie: [yelps] Ow.\nStarlight Glimmer: Trixie? What are you doing here?\nTrixie: Huh. I often seek the privacy of the orchard to practice new feats of amazement. And also, I fell asleep.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh. Well, Sunburst and I were just catching up, so\u2014\nTrixie: [gasps] I don't suppose the two of you want to see a never-before-witnessed magical marvel?\nSunburst: Sure!\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] Why not?\n\nTrixie: Behold, visiting friend from Starlight's past, and be amazed by the Great and Powerful \u2013 and current best friend of Starlight \u2013 Trixie!\n[fireworks]\n[chains rattling]\n[padlock clicks]\nTrixie: I give you... the Unicorn Escape! [grunting] Just... a sec... One more... [grunts] twist... and... [grunts] [straining] The Great and Powerful Trixie requires a little assistance.\nSunburst: I know this trick. There's a special link, but I could never hold the chain up long enough to find it.\n[chains rattling]\nSunburst: [grunting]\nTrixie: [pained grunting]\n[pop!]\nTrixie: Well, if I could do magic like that, I'd have a whole slew of new tricks at my disposal.\nSunburst: I always liked close-up magic because I knew I could do it if I just practiced enough.\nTrixie: [giggling]\n\n[montage music continues]\n[clomp, clomp]\n\n[newspaper tearing]\n\n[cards shuffling]\n\n[box shaking]\n[ball rolling]\n\nTrixie: Starlight, why didn't you tell me how much Sunburst and I had in common?\nStarlight Glimmer: [sarcastic] Gee. I don't know.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: I know Trixie's \"magic\" is, you know, fun. But the Mirror Pool is actual magic.\nSunburst: Whoa. This place is pure pony lore.\nStarlight Glimmer: Yup. I mean, it's supposed to be all dangerous, and I guess I shouldn't have broken the seal to get in, but you wanted to see the sights of Ponyville, right?\nSunburst: So, Pinkie Pie just dove in and made copies of herself?\nStarlight Glimmer: Mm-hmm. If we made copies of ourselves, we could get a year's worth of hanging out over in one day.\n[beat]\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, not that we would.\n[tapping]\nSunburst: Do you hear that?\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh. I hope it's not a leftover Pinkie Pie.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Not exactly.\nStarlight Glimmer: Maud! How did you get in here?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] This cavern's actually connected to mine.\nSunburst: Uh, what are you doing?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Tapping.\nStarlight Glimmer: Maud isn't super chatty. I mean, you and I could sit around and talk all day, but she looks pretty busy.\nSunburst: Are you taking some kind of core sample?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Not exactly. I'm uncovering this section of strata for closer study. You might want to step back.\n[crumbling]\nStarlight Glimmer: [coughing]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I'm studying this area's metamorphic\u2014\nSunburst: \u2014foliation. Is this gneiss, phyllite, or slate? Wow. The pressure above must be pretty uniform to get the planar fabric to be this consistent.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] You know about geology?\nSunburst: Eh, I dabble. For example, by the speleothems in this cave, I kind of figured there was another way out.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Because of the calcite deposits.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs]\n\n[montage music continues]\n[bubbling]\n[squeaking]\n[ting!]\n\n[tapping]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight? Where's Sunburst?\nStarlight Glimmer: [mumbles \"I don't know\"] Doing stage magic with Trixie? Studying new rocks with Maud? You're here, so I guess you two aren't off translating some ancient Olde Ponish text.\nTwilight Sparkle: What are you talking about? Why would Sunburst be doing any of that? I thought he came to Ponyville to see you.\nStarlight Glimmer: I thought so, too, but it hasn't worked out that way. When we were foals, we had more in common than any two ponies in Equestria. But now, it seems like he's got more in common with my friends than he does with me.\n[clunk]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. Everypony changes, but that doesn't mean there aren't still things you both like. You both love magic, right?\nStarlight Glimmer: Magic?\nTwilight Sparkle: Sure. You're really good at it, and Sunburst practically knows every spell that ever was.\nStarlight Glimmer: [gasps] You're right! Thanks, Twilight! You're the best!\nTwilight Sparkle: Heh. I try.\n\nSunburst: Starlight, what happened? Maud and I found some fascinating sedimentary stratum, but when I turned to show you, you were gone.\nStarlight Glimmer: Maud does have a way of making rocks really interesting, but I wanted to work on something a little more \"us\".\nSunburst: What's this?\nStarlight Glimmer: Just a little something I made up.\nSunburst: Whoa! You made up this spell? Just now?\nStarlight Glimmer: Yup!\n[magic zap]\n[wind whirling]\nSunburst: Wow.\nStarlight Glimmer: I know, right? But wait, there's more!\n[magic zap]\n[wind whirling]\nYoung Starlight Glimmer: Cool, right?!\nYoung Sunburst: Um... sure.\nYoung Starlight Glimmer: Now we can play Dragon Pit! Just like we used to!\nYoung Sunburst: Actually, I thought we could go with Maud and\u2014\nYoung Starlight Glimmer: I mean, nothing was better than just you and me playing this game when we were foals, right?\nYoung Sunburst: Starlight.\nYoung Starlight Glimmer: Do you what to be red or blue?\nYoung Sunburst: Starlight! I don't want to play the game at all!\n[magic zap]\n[whoosh]\n[shimmer!]\n[door creaks]\nTwilight Sparkle: What's going on in here?\nStarlight Glimmer: Nothing. I was trying to have fun doing the one thing I thought we still had in common, but I guess we don't even have that anymore.\n\nSunburst: I don't understand. Starlight and I have known each other since we were foals, but that doesn't mean we have to be foals to hang out.\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, Starlight does have a tendency to overdo.\nSunburst: I mean, it is surprising how well I get along with all of her friends, but she and I still have tons in common.\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe you just need to remind her what those things are.\nSunburst: That's it! That's exactly what I'll do! Uh, right after I think of them.\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh-oh.\n\nTrixie: Obviously you and I hit it off. I am quite impressive. And we share a love for prestidigitation.\n[poof!]\nSunburst: Right. And Starlight and I share a lot of things, too. I just need to think of them. What else do you guys have in common?\nTrixie: Well, we've both made not-so-great choices in the past.\n[pop, pop!]\n[pop!]\nTrixie: And we're self-conscious about everypony judging us, even though we've both changed and are trying hard to be better.\n[sawing]\nSunburst: Yeah, we don't really have that.\n[beat]\n[clop, clop]\nTrixie: Hmph! I can think of something you have in common. You're both poor practice audiences.\n\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Starlight and I don't really have a lot in common. Other than feeling different from most ponies. And comedy.\nSunburst: Comedy?\n[clatter]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I'm very funny.\nSunburst: Was that a joke?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] No.\nSunburst: Oh. Well, that's more than I can think of that she and I have in common.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] We don't really spend that much time talking about that, though. Mostly we're just comfortable around each other.\nSunburst: [sighs] We used to be. We did everything together. But now I'm wondering if we've spent so much time apart that we don't connect over anything anymore. And if we can't connect over anything, then maybe we're not even friends!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Well, at least it's not serious. That was a joke.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] I appreciate you trying to help, Twilight. But it seems pretty clear that Sunburst and I have grown apart.\nTwilight Sparkle: I understand. But I feel like that only happens if you both let it. You still want to be friends, right?\nStarlight Glimmer: I created a spell so we could relive playing a game in our childhood home... and bodies.\nTwilight Sparkle: Right...\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm just not sure Sunburst wants to stay friends, too.\nTwilight Sparkle: I think you might be surprised.\n[door opens]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Prepare yourself...\nTrixie: ...for the new and improved Dragon Pit!\n\nSunburst: We had to take out a few spaces to get it to fit, but you hardly miss them. Maud made the dice.\n[die clatters]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Pumice is the lightest igneous rock. It seemed the best choice.\n[die clatters]\nTrixie: And I added the special effects. There's nothing like a little well-placed magic smoke.\n[poof!]\nTwilight Sparkle: Looks like somepony's dragon is going to get trapped.\nStarlight Glimmer: I thought you didn't want to play this game.\nSunburst: Well, I didn't want to pretend to be a foal, but I know you wanted to play. I thought it'd be fun to play a version big enough for full-grown ponies. What do you think? Fun, right?\nStarlight Glimmer: Actually, it's missing something.\n[magic zap]\n[cracking]\nSunburst: Aaaah! [grunts]\nStarlight Glimmer: [giggles] Now it's fun.\nAll except Maud Pie: [laughing]\n\n[brakes hissing]\nStarlight Glimmer: I don't know why I got so worried about us not having anything in common.\nSunburst: Yeah. I kind of think it doesn't matter as long as we enjoy each other's company.\nTrixie: And that game was certainly enjoyable.\nStarlight Glimmer: What made it even better was getting to play it with all my friends.\nSunburst: See you soon?\nStarlight Glimmer: You bet. I want to hear if you find anything interesting in that barrel.\nSunburst: Trust me, Starlight. You'll be the first to know.\n[train whistle blows]\n[train chugging]\n[ominous music]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nStar Swirl the Bearded: [narrating] The best elements within us can spread light and virtue, and I know ponies who represent them all \u2013 strength, bravery, healing, beauty, hope, and sorcery. Myself and these Pillars of Equestria were gathered together by another to maintain and share the light of these powerful ideals. But we soon came to believe the pony who brought us together only wanted that power for himself. Cast out and alone, this power-mad pony turned to darkness to satisfy his thirst. Transformed into a Pony of Shadows, he returned for revenge \u2013 to extinguish the Pillars' light and rob the world of hope. To stop him, the Pillars and I must make a grave sacrifice. But we shall leave behind a seed in hopes that one day it will grow into a force to stand against the darkness for all time. We must now face the fiend with the only plan we have...\n\nSunburst: [reading] \"...I only hope it will be enough.\" That's the last entry. And maybe Star Swirl's final words before he vanished.\n\n[theme song]\n\nPrincess Celestia: I've always wondered what happened to Star Swirl. This is quite a discovery, Sunburst.\nTwilight Sparkle: So it's genuine? You can verify that this journal really belonged to Star Swirl the Bearded?!\nPrincess Luna: Indeed. From the looks of it, the last thing he wrote before facing the Pony of Shadows.\nRainbow Dash: Uh... So, the Pony of Shadows was really real?\nPrincess Celestia: It appears so.\nPrincess Luna: We never met the other Pillars, and we were too young to understand the danger they faced.\nApplejack: Hold on a second now. All those legendary ponies were real, too? And they went off with Star Swirl to face the Pony of Shadows, and then none of them were ever heard from again?\nPinkie Pie: Uh, yeah. Weren't you listening?\nFluttershy: But what happened to them all?\nRarity: They must have defeated the villain, since Equestria is still full of light and hope.\nStarlight Glimmer: But how? And where did they go?\nPrincess Celestia: My Olde Ponish is a bit rusty, but I wonder if the answers can be found somewhere within the pages of this book.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, I just happen to be an expert in Olde Ponish. I mean, I've practically memorized every ancient text about Star Swirl there is!\nSpike: Seriously. All of them.\nPrincess Luna: We have fond memories of our old teacher. If you could discover what happened to him, we would be most grateful.\nSunburst: Solving a thousands-year-old mystery could take forever! Think of the research! The re-reading! The re-re-reading!\nPrincess Celestia: You might find you need help.\nApplejack: Luckily, she's got a whole bushel o' helpers right here.\nRainbow Dash: Totally! Uh... how long will all this research take, exactly?\nTwilight Sparkle: Let's get this back to my library. I'm sure we'll figure out what happened in no time.\nRest of Mane Six: [excited chatter]\n\n[candlelight fizzles]\nSpike: [yawns] Figure it out yet, Twilight?\nSunburst: [snoring]\n[thud]\n[paper rustling]\nSunburst: [yelps] What did you figure out?\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] You figured something out? [slurps]\nFluttershy: What is it?\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Nothing. I mean, Star Swirl was a genius, obviously. But forget Olde Ponish. There's parts where his hornwriting is like another language! [groans]\nApplejack: Twilight, we've been studyin' and referencin' and cross-referencin' for three days straight now.\nRainbow Dash: Ugh. I haven't spent this much time reading since the last Daring Do book came out.\nRarity: Perhaps it is time to take a break. This mystery is over a thousand years old, after all. Another day or two won't make a difference.\nTwilight Sparkle: Two days?! I don't want to waste two seconds! I'm close to an answer. I can feel it.\nStarlight Glimmer: [reading] \"Hearg sylfum se Ponhenge\". What's that?\nTwilight Sparkle: The Temple of Ponhenge?! You can read that?!\nStarlight Glimmer: The hornwriting's pretty sloppy, but it's nowhere near as bad as mine. [reading] \"Toward dol grimlic of Fola Firgenbeorg\"?\nSunburst: \"At the base of Foal Mountain\"...\nStarlight Glimmer: [reading] \"User endemest scield\".\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] \"Our last stand\".\nSpike: [yawns] Well, that sure sounds like a clue to me. [blows]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: This is it. Ponhenge. I can't believe it.\nSunburst: I've never seen magical runes like these before! Have you?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh-uh.\nRainbow Dash: I don't think anypony's seen any of this for a long time. [straining] Whoa!\nApplejack: It'd take a whole team of ponies to clear away all this brush.\n[rock clatters]\nFluttershy: Even then, I'm not sure we'd find out what happened here over a thousand years ago.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] You're right. I suppose it was a long shot.\nSpike: Cheer up, Twilight. Finding a whole set of ancient ruins is pretty impressive. Maybe you could write a paper on it.\nTwilight Sparkle: I guess I hoped we'd get here and the mystery would just magically be explained.\n[magic shimmering]\nSpike: Uh... Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\n[magic humming]\nTwilight Sparkle: Star Swirl!? I... I've wanted to meet you my whole life! I can't believe you're here!\n[low humming]\nSunburst: I don't think he is here. I don't think any of them are.\n[static fizzling]\n[magic zap]\n[boom!]\n[boom!]\nPony of Shadows: [laughing evilly] You summon me at your peril, Star Swirl! Once I defeat all of you, this realm will embrace the darkness as I did so long ago! [roars]\n[vines snapping]\nPony of Shadows: [laughing evilly] Drawing me here will only make me stronger. You will never defeat me!\nStar Swirl the Bearded: We did not come here to defeat you.\n[magic shimmering]\nPony of Shadows: What are you doing?!\nStar Swirl the Bearded: We came... to contain you.\nPony of Shadows: [screams]\n[thud, poof]\n[magic shimmers]\nPinkie Pie: [to Twilight] Well, you did ask for a magical explanation.\n\nRainbow Dash: Uh... what just happened?\nStarlight Glimmer: It looked like Star Swirl cast a spell that banished the Pony of Shadows.\nSunburst: Of course! Powerful magic like that would leave an impression on this place. Bringing the book back here let us see what happened.\nApplejack: Which was what?\nTwilight Sparkle: Star Swirl and the rest of the Pillars sacrificed themselves to save Equestria.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: It's amazing to think one of the greatest mysteries of Equestria was solved with a musty old book from an antique shop.\nSunburst: But I wouldn't say the mystery's solved. Star Swirl's spell was one of the most powerful feats of magic in all of history. It'll take years of study before we fully understand it.\nTwilight Sparkle: I think I understand Star Swirl's spell!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I know I've finished one of Star Swirl's spells before, but this one was on a whole different level! Was it an explosion of magical feedback? An evocation? A kind of incantation? It's Star Swirl, so the possibilities are endless! And once Starlight set me on the right track with his crazy hornwriting \u2013 [laughs, snorts] I mean, he was a genius, so I guess we can forgive a little messiness \u2013 I went through the journal again, and it's amazing!\nRarity: Twilight, darling. We understand you're excited, but that's all we understand.\nRainbow Dash: What exactly is so amazing?\nTwilight Sparkle: Only how Star Swirl and the other Pillars sent the Pony of Shadows to limbo!\nApplejack: They did what now?\nTwilight Sparkle: They used their magic to open a portal between worlds \u2013 to limbo \u2013 and pulled the Pony of Shadows inside.\n[poof!]\nRarity: Darling, your diorama!\nTwilight Sparkle: I made more!\n[clatter]\nTwilight Sparkle: Star Swirl thought the only way to trap the Pony of Shadows in limbo was for the Pillars to take him there.\nApplejack: So they got stuck, too!\nFluttershy: The Pony of Shadows must have been really awful for them to do that.\nPinkie Pie: I suppose being trapped for all time with a super-duper bad guy in limbo might be okay if you were doing the limbo, but that's still pushing it.\nTwilight Sparkle: The thing is, I think I can get them out.\nSunburst: Twilight, are you serious? You can save the most legendary ponies of all time?\nStarlight Glimmer: I-I don't know. Opening portals between worlds didn't work out well for me. Are you sure it's safe?\nTwilight Sparkle: First of all, you opened portals through time. And second of all, Star Swirl wrote the spell you used to do it. If he'd been here, he could have stopped it. Equestria would be safer with him in it. We have to save him.\nApplejack: But you'd be savin' all the Pillars, right? A-And they disappeared ages ago.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's the thing about limbo. It isn't one place or another. It's in between, so time stands still. If we can pull them out, it'll be like they never left. I actually built another model to demonstrate\u2014\nRainbow Dash: [groans]\n[thud]\nSpike: What can we do to help?\nTwilight Sparkle: If I'm right, we need to find items that are connected to the Pillars in some way.\nRainbow Dash: You mean, like, stuff that belonged to them?\nFluttershy: How would we know what to look for? Or where?\nTwilight Sparkle: Luckily, Star Swirl took a lot of notes. [reading] \"My compatriots are as varied as the realm itself and hail from every corner of our land, bringing with them artifacts and talismans of great power.\"\n[magic shimmering]\nStarlight Glimmer: Um, Twilight? What are you doing?\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm not doing anything!\nApplejack: Rockhoof's shovel!\nRainbow Dash: Flash Magnus' shield!\nRarity: Mistmane's flower!\nFluttershy: Meadowbrook's mask!\nPinkie Pie: And the blindfold Somnambula wore when she faced that nasty sphinx!\nTwilight Sparkle: I guess we don't need to figure out who should get what.\n\nPetunia Paleo: Professor! It's a Mighty Helm headpiece! Maybe it belonged to Rockhoof himself!\nProfessor Fossil: Legends don't wear helmets. This belonged to a real pony.\nApplejack: Oh, I can guarantee Rockhoof was as real as you and me.\nProfessor Fossil: [chuckling] And I suppose that ravine was dug with his trusty shovel to save the village from an erupting volcano.\nApplejack: Probably.\nProfessor Fossil: I love old legends as much as anypony. But a pony strong enough to save a village from rushing lava with a shovel is... preposterous.\n[rumbling]\n[ponies yelping]\nApplejack: [straining, grunts]\n[loud thud]\n[birds chirping]\nProfessor Fossil: I can't believe you just did that. Y-You saved us!\nApplejack: I bet if you told somepony else the story, it might sound... [gasps] \"preposterous\".\nProfessor Fossil: I suppose some stories might be true...\n[magic humming]\nProfessor Fossil: And Rockhoof's appears to be one of them.\n\n[gate creaking]\n[smack!]\nRarity: Ow!\n\"Lotus Petal\": You keep those hooves to yourself, dearie! This place has been in my family for generations, and I'm not about to let some whippersnapper take the last good piece of it! Time was, ponies came from far and wide to see these gardens. But that flower's the only worthwhile thing left!\n[hedge trimmers snipping]\n[broom sweeping]\n[hedge trimmers snipping]\nRarity: Perhaps it just seemed like your gardens were worthless. But a little pruning can work wonders. Of course you will have to look after more than just one flower now.\n\"Lotus Petal\": You've given me back my family's legacy. The flower you wanted seems like a fair trade for that.\n[magic humming]\n\nRainbow Dash: I can't believe Flash Magnus' shield ended up in the Dragon Lands.\nSpike: Good thing you brought the official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons to help you navigate our customs. Like our favorite sport \u2013 gorge surfing!\nMaar: Wahoo! [whooping] Ollie!\n[dragons cheering]\nRainbow Dash: Okay. That was awesome.\n\"Billy\": Dragon Lord Ember commanded us to make peace with ponies, but it doesn't mean you can surf in our spot.\n[dragons growling]\nSpike: Whoa, fellas. As the official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons, I have to say that's not very friendly.\nGarble: Well, what do you know? The puny pony-dragon's sticking up for his pony pal.\nRainbow Dash: Hey! That's an ancient pony artifact!\nGarble: Hooves off my gorge board! I found it in the desert, and finders keepers.\nRainbow Dash: It isn't yours.\nGarble: Huh. It sure looks like mine. But I might consider racing you for it.\nRainbow Dash: No problem.\nGarble: Um... No. I mean [to Spike] you.\nSpike: [nervous chuckling]\n\n[dragons cheering]\nDragon: Awesome!\nGarble: [blows raspberry]\nSpike: [gulps]\n\"Billy\": On your marks... Get set... Surf!\n[lava splashing]\nSpike: Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaaa! Aaah! [grunting] [painting] I won? I won! Woo-hoo! Give up the shield, Garble!\nGarble: [grunts] Lord Ember only commanded us to be nice to ponies. She never said anything about pony-loving dragons.\n\nSpike: Uh, s-since Dragon Lord Ember commanded you to make peace with ponies, you can't very well attack one of their friends, can you?\nGarble: I guess we'll find out! [grunts] Aaah!\n[thunk]\nGarble: Ugh. Why is he always hiding behind ponies?\nSpike: I wasn't hiding when I beat you down the ridge.\nGarble: You fell.\nRainbow Dash: Wow. You must be slow if all Spike had to do to win was fall down.\nGarble: I'm faster than you.\nRainbow Dash: Doubt it.\nGarble: Fine! I'll race you back to the top. If you win, you can have your pony junk. But if I win, you'll leave and I get to give it to him!\nRainbow Dash: Fine. I'm pretty sure I could beat you anyway. But with that heavy hunk of metal on your back, it'll be a snap.\nGarble: Huh? Oh, yeah. Thanks for the tip.\n[shield clatters]\nGarble: See ya at the top, loser! Hey! That's mine!\nSpike: Finders keepers, remember?\n\"Billy\": See, because that's what you said to them when they first showed up\u2014\n[thud]\n\n[flash bees buzzing]\nFluttershy: Just remember not to turn away from them, Cattail. Flash bees can get pretty aggressive. I guess that's why none of the other bayou animals can get to the water.\n[animals whimpering]\nCattail: Wouldn't it make more sense for you to wear the mask that calms the bees?\nFluttershy: It would... if I didn't have to fly up here to move their hive. There!\n[flash bees buzzing]\nFluttershy: Now the other bayou creatures can get to the water without the bees feeling threatened.\n[splashing]\nCattail: You know, you didn't have to help with this. I would've lent you the mask anyway.\nFluttershy: I know. [giggles] But I couldn't leave without helping.\n[magic humming]\n\n\"Fahal Alkhayl\": I don't think anypony can find anything in there.\nDaring Do: I wouldn't give up hope just yet.\n[slime draining]\nPinkie Pie: This old blindfold was stuck in the drain.\nDaring Do: Weren't you looking for a blindfold?\nPinkie Pie: Oh, yeah!\n[magic humming]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't believe I'm gonna meet Star Swirl the Bearded! You know, outside of my dreams.\nStarlight Glimmer: I can't believe you're actually going through with it.\nTwilight Sparkle: What do you mean?\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm all for pushing the envelope, obviously, but this is pretty out there for you, Twilight.\nSunburst: What's \"out there\" about saving the most legendary ponies of all time from a thousands-year-old prison?\nStarlight Glimmer: Well... nothing when you say it like that. Unless \"the most legendary ponies of all time\" knew what they were doing, and we shouldn't mess with it.\nSunburst: I'm sure Star Swirl and the Pillars did the best they could back then, but magic has come a long way. Mostly because of the work they did.\nStarlight Glimmer: That's true. And you did get your wings from finishing one of Star Swirl's spells.\nTwilight Sparkle: Exactly.\nStarlight Glimmer: But then I messed with one and nearly destroyed the universe, so...\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight, Star Swirl the Bearded is the greatest wizard who ever lived. The chance to have him back in Equestria is worth the risk.\nSpike: That's good news.\nRainbow Dash: Otherwise, we'd have brought this shield for nothing.\nApplejack: I hope you don't think you're the only one to find her artifact, because this here shovel says otherwise.\nRarity: [laughing] Honestly, you two. Not everything is a competition. But Mistmane's flower is by far the most attractive of the artifacts.\nPinkie Pie: You're just saying that because you didn't have to scuba dive in a pit of green slime to get yours!\nFluttershy: Or move a flash beehive.\nTwilight Sparkle: Good work, everyone. Let's do this!\n[magic zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans]\n[magic zaps]\n[magic humming]\n[boom!]\n[thuds, crashes]\nStar Swirl the Bearded: What... What has happened?\nTwilight Sparkle: It worked! We brought you back!\nStar Swirl the Bearded: To where?\nTwilight Sparkle: You and the others have been trapped in limbo for over a thousand years, but I figured out how to get you ho\u2014\nStar Swirl the Bearded: What?! No, no, no, no! You must undo what you've done!\nTwilight Sparkle: What? Why? I mean, I don't think I can.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: You cannot bring us back!\nTwilight Sparkle: But I did. I brought all the Pillars back.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: You cannot bring only the Pillars back!\n[lightning strikes]\n[ponies gasp]\nPony of Shadows: [laughing evilly]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, no!\n\n[to be continued]\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[Previously on My Little Pony]\n\nSunburst: That's the last entry. Star Swirl's final words before he vanished.\n\nApplejack: All those legendary ponies were real, too? And then none of them were ever heard from again?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: They used their magic to open a portal to limbo.\n\nPony of Shadows: [screams]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: We need to find items that are connected to the Pillars in some way.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: We brought you back!\n\nStar Swirl the Bearded: You cannot bring only the Pillars back!\n\nPony of Shadows: [laughing evilly]\n\n[theme song]\n\nPony of Shadows: [laughing evilly] Your pitiful attempt to imprison me has failed, Star Swirl!\n[magic fizzles]\nStar Swirl the Bearded: You must return us to limbo. It's the only way to stop him.\nTwilight Sparkle: I only figured out how to bring you back.\nSunburst: Working on it! No table of contents!\nPony of Shadows: Allow me to assist. [grunts]\n[vines lashing]\n[rocks breaking]\nPony of Shadows: There! Without the power of Ponhenge, your banishing spell is useless!\nStar Swirl the Bearded: You have studied my writings. Surely you have some other plan.\nTwilight Sparkle: No. I just wanted to save you. I didn't think\u2014\nPony of Shadows: Don't fret. When I extinguish the light and hope of this miserable world, you won't remember any of this.\nTwilight Sparkle: No!\n[magic zap]\nPony of Shadows: Argh! This one is almost as... strong as you, Star Swirl. But even in my weakened state, she cannot stop the might of shadows! [grunts]\n[magic zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: [straining]\n[magic zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Lucky for her, she's not alone!\nPony of Shadows: [straining] Arrrrggghhhh!\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Know this, fiend! We will not rest until we find a way to return you to limbo!\nPony of Shadows: [growls] Never! Your days of glory are through, Star Swirl. Now my dark power will reign, and you six will bow to me!\n[whoosh]\nRainbow Dash: Um... where'd he go?\nSomnambula: That is a riddle we must unravel. And quickly.\nMage Meadowbrook: How long have we been gone?\nFluttershy: Over a thousand years.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Then my spell worked \u2013 before it was meddled with \u2013 and the realm has been at peace for a millennia!\nPinkie Pie: Weeeeell... we did have to save everypony from Nightmare Moon and Discord and Chrysalis and King Sombra and Lord Tirek, and there was that one time when Starlight traveled through time and almost destroyed life as we know it! But that's all in the past.\nFlash Magnus: If you are truly this accomplished, we will stop the Pony of Shadows twice as fast together.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: We shall see. It is an easy thing to say you have saved the world. It is quite another to do it.\nRainbow Dash: Oh, we've saved the world, Beardo. And we can do it again.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Be that as it may, the problem of locating the Pony of Shadows remains, and this land is vast.\nRarity: It sounds like you need a map. Luckily, we have just the thing.\n\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Something about this magic seems familiar...\n[magic zap]\n[ponies gasp]\nRarity: Did you know he can do that?\nTwilight Sparkle: He's Star Swirl! He can do anything!\nStar Swirl the Bearded: This map, and indeed this very castle, are grown from the seed we planted over a thousand years ago.\nRockhoof: Then it did work!\nSunburst: What worked?\nSomnambula: Each of us infused a crystal seed with our magic in hopes that it would grow into a force for good.\nMistmane: We wanted to leave something to protect the realm in our absence, but we never dreamed our gift would become so powerful.\nApplejack: Y'all mean the Elements came from you?\nPinkie Pie: You know, the sparkly crystal things that grow from the Tree of Harmony and represent each of us? Laughter, honesty, generosity, loyalty, kindness, and magic!\nSomnambula: They are reflections of our own elements of hope, strength, beauty, bravery, healing, and sorcery.\nMage Meadowbrook: We had no idea our small seed would bloom into the living spirit of the land. I am glad our mantles have passed to such capable ponies.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: More importantly, we no longer need Ponhenge to send our foe back to limbo. We can use the stored magic in this Tree of Harmony.\nTwilight Sparkle: But doesn't a banishing spell take a lot of power? We'd have to sacrifice the Elements for that.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Mm-hmm.\nFluttershy: They'd be gone... forever?\nTwilight Sparkle: Star Swirl, I don't think the Tree can survive without the Elements. If it dies, Equestria will suffer.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: If the Pony of Shadows has his way, your land will not exist. So unless you have a better idea...\n[magic zap]\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Our foe will seek dark places from which to draw power. I will prepare my spell so that we may strike as soon as you find him.\nRainbow Dash: What are we waiting for?\nFlash Magnus: I like your spirit!\n[excited chatter]\n\nSpike: What about this one?\nTwilight Sparkle: Seapony etiquette isn't going to help right now, Spike.\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, Twilight? Are you okay?\nTwilight Sparkle: I just unleashed ultimate evil and doomed Equestria because I was obsessed with meeting my idol! Why wouldn't I be okay?!\n[thud]\nStarlight Glimmer: [scoffs] You didn't know that was gonna happen.\nTwilight Sparkle: But I should have listened to you and left things alone. Now the Elements of Harmony will be lost to fix my mistake!\nStarlight Glimmer: Maybe there's another way.\nSpike: If there is, Twilight will find it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Portal gate... Portal keys... Portal spells... Yes! If the Pillars can hold open the gateway to limbo, a powerful pony can do the banishing spell herself! Do you know what this means?\nSpike: [panting] I can stop carrying books?\nTwilight Sparkle: The Pillars don't have to leave Equestria! Even though we'll lose the Elements, we'll have the ponies that created them. And the Pony of Shadows will be banished for good!\nStarlight Glimmer: That's great. Heh. But I was thinking of another way that maybe doesn't involve banishing at all?\nTwilight Sparkle: Star Swirl knew what he was doing when he cast that spell. If I can make it even better, maybe he'll see that I take magic as seriously as he does.\n\nRockhoof: It seems the dark places Star Swirl indicated on the map have changed.\nApplejack: I bet the Pony of Shadows would've loved the Ghastly Caverns before a thousand years of erosion turned it into the Ghastly Gorge.\nFluttershy: The Appeloosian Wastes sure sounded dark and desolate.\nRarity: Who knew they would become such a popular square dancing destination?\nPinkie Pie: And I get how this part of Equestria used to be cast in eternal night where the Pony of Shadows could draw power and wreak havoc while ponies were powerless to stop him. But...\n[clang]\nPinkie Pie: [echoing] ...it's kinda made a comeback! Did I mention it's really bright?!\n\nStar Swirl the Bearded: It seems there are fewer dark corners in the realm these days.\nRainbow Dash: Isn't that a good thing?\nFlash Magnus: True. The Pony of Shadows will have a hard time regaining power. When he rears his head, we'll be ready!\n[thunk]\nFluttershy: Isn't there some way to banish him without losing all of you?\nMage Meadowbrook: Oh, I wish there were. But to save our home, we are willin' to leave it.\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't think you'll have to! My spell isn't finished yet, but I think we can send the Pony of Shadows to limbo without all of you having to go as well!\nStar Swirl the Bearded: While I appreciate your enthusiasm, Twilight, this is hardly the time to take risks on half-baked spells.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\nApplejack: Beggin' your pardon, Mr. the Bearded! But Twilight doesn't do anythin' halfway!\nPinkie Pie: Especially not magic!\nRainbow Dash: Seriously! She got her wings by finishing one of your spells!\nRarity: I think you'll find her work is worth reading before you dismiss it out of hoof!\nFluttershy: Mm-hmm!\nMage Meadowbrook: While it is an unconventional approach, I believe it could work.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Hmm. I suppose there is a chance.\nSunburst: But we still have no idea where to find the villain.\n[cutie marks shimmering]\nSpike: Maybe we should try there?\n\nApplejack: The Hollow Shades. I think a branch of the Apple family lives there.\nSunburst: They'd have to be pretty distant. The Hollow Shades was abandoned eons ago.\nRarity: Hmm, that's odd. The only time the map's called all of us to one place was Starlight's village.\nRainbow Dash: So it's like a super-villain tracker! No offense.\nTwilight Sparkle: Do you think the map could be trying to tell us where the Pony of Shadows is?\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Hmm... The Tree of Harmony acting to protect the light of the realm... Yes. A good thought, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: [squeals]\nStar Swirl the Bearded: I will make my notes on this spell. Ready yourselves for battle.\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, I know I'm not as experienced as all of you, but is banishment really the only option? I mean, it's been a long time. Maybe the Pony of Shadows is ready to talk?\nStar Swirl the Bearded: I doubt we can save our homeland with a conversation.\nStarlight Glimmer: But we could try.\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight, I'm sure Star Swirl and the others did try.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: The Pony of Shadows was not interested in reconciliation. Once a villain, always a villain. Twilight, Sunburst, would you accompany me? I wish to refine this spell for our use.\nRockhoof: Come. We must prepare for the struggle ahead.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] I know Star Swirl is a great wizard, but this whole plan seems... wrong. The map's only ever sent us to solve friendship problems.\nSpike: Maybe so, but the Pony of Shadows doesn't really seem like the \"friendship\" type.\nStarlight Glimmer: Honestly? We don't know anything about him.\nSpike: Well, nopony does.\nStarlight Glimmer: That's not entirely true.\n\n[squeaking]\n[grinding]\nStarlight Glimmer: You all knew the Pony of Shadows before he became what he is now. You must've been friends. So what happened?\nRockhoof: The tale of our rift is a sad one.\n\nSirens: [operatic singing]\n[ponies arguing]\n[clang!]\nRockhoof: [narrating] Stygian was a pony like the rest of us, though more scholar than hero. He recognized our emerging world would need champions to defend it.\nAria Blaze: [hisses, roars]\nSirens: [roaring]\n[magic zap]\n[ponies cheering]\nFlash Magnus: [narrating] He may have gathered us together, but he himself was just an ordinary unicorn who soon grew jealous of our abilities.\n\nMistmane: [narrating] He stole objects from each of us. Artifacts to use in a spell.\nMage Meadowbrook: [narrating] And we cast him out for it.\nSomnambula: [narrating] We always thought he'd return and seek forgiveness. But when we saw him again, his heart was bent on revenge. He dashed even my hope of saving him.\n[magic zap]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: But why did he steal the artifacts from you?\nMage Meadowbrook: No doubt it was an enchantment to take our powers for himself.\nStarlight Glimmer: Hmm...\n\n[door opens]\nStarlight Glimmer: That looks like a lot of work.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: It is what must be done, and it would be best if we were not disturbed.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sorry, Starlight, but we can't stop to talk. The stakes are too high, and we have to\u2014\nStarlight Glimmer: Banish Stygian to limbo. I get it.\nSunburst: Uh, who?\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Stygian was the name the Pony of Shadows gave up when he turned to darkness.\nStarlight Glimmer: And I'm just trying to figure out why.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Envy. He wanted more power than he had, and that desire led him down a path from which there is no return!\nStarlight Glimmer: I know from experience that's not always true. When the map called you six to my village, it was for a friendship problem. Are you sure this is different?\nTwilight Sparkle: I...\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Stygian wants to destroy all that is good in this world. There's no way to befriend a pony like that.\nStarlight Glimmer: I guess I'm lucky your idol wasn't around when you decided to be my friend. I might've been banished to limbo, too.\n[door closes]\n\nSomnambula: I am glad we have the chance to see what has grown from our efforts so long ago.\nMistmane: It seems a shame to harm it.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: A necessary sacrifice. With the Elements' power, we will bind the Pony of Shadows in limbo. And thanks to Twilight, we will remain to watch over the realm ourselves.\n[magic humming]\nRockhoof: Um... how do we use them?\nRarity: Well, you... Oh. I'm not sure. They simply work for us.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: The Elements are attuned to you. We must use their magic in pairs.\nRainbow Dash: No problem. We're used to banishing evil before breakfast.\n[hoof-bump]\nApplejack: And it'll be an honor to save Equestria with y'all.\nStarlight Glimmer: I really hope Twilight knows what she's doing...\n\nSunburst: I don't remember reading anything that said the Hollow Shades was like this.\nMistmane: Ohhh. The Pony of Shadows must have twisted it to his purposes.\n[evil chuckle echoing]\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Prepare yourselves. He is here. Stygian! Show yourself and face us!\nPony of Shadows: [laughing evilly]\n[rumbling]\n[cracking]\n[ponies scream]\nSunburst: [groans] I definitely would've remembered reading about this.\nPony of Shadows: [laughing maniacally] Welcome to the Well of Shade! When you turned your backs on me, I discovered this place. The darkness spoke to me of a power beyond any I could imagine, and I listened. The shadow and I became one. Soon, all of the realm will be the same. Then all ponies will feel the despair I did when you cast me out!\nStar Swirl the Bearded: We did what we had to do. You tried to steal our powers for yourself.\nPony of Shadows: No! It was you who were selfish! And now you will pay!\n[magic zap]\n[cracking]\nStarlight Glimmer: Are you still sure this isn't a friendship problem?\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Ready? Open the portal...\n[shatter!]\nStar Swirl the Bearded: ...Now!\n[magic shimmering]\n[wind whistling]\n[magic zap]\nPony of Shadows: No! You will not trap me again!\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Twilight! Push him in!\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh? There's... a pony in there.\nPony of Shadows: [roars]\n\n[light humming]\nTwilight Sparkle: Are you... Stygian?\nStygian: I was, once. Until my friends betrayed me.\nTwilight Sparkle: But Star Swirl says you betrayed them. You wanted their magic...\nStygian: No! I wanted their respect. I brought them together. I planned strategy, and I read all I could about the beasts we faced. But I didn't have magic or strength, so nopony ever noticed me. I went to Ponhenge to make my own copies of the artifacts. With them, I thought I could be a Pillar, too, and stand by their side in battle. I never wanted to steal their power. But instead of sharing and letting me help, my friends threw me out. [voice deepening and growling] So I became stronger than any of them! The darkness welcomed me when no pony would, and I will do what I must to protect it!\nTwilight Sparkle: This is all a misunderstanding! If the Pillars knew how you felt, I'm sure they wouldn't have turned their backs on you. The shadow isn't who you really are. Let me help you be Stygian again.\nStygian: Even if my friends did still care, what makes you think you have the power to help me?\nStarlight Glimmer: Because it's what she does. I wasn't so different from you, and Twilight helped me change. If there's one pony in Equestria that can save a friendship, it's her.\nStygian: I... I want to believe you... [growls] But the darkness will not be stopped!\nTwilight Sparkle: Aah! [grunts]\nPony of Shadows: Argh! [pained groans]\nTwilight Sparkle: Fight the darkness, Stygian! You don't need it anymore! Revenge isn't what you want! Friendship is!\nPony of Shadows: [growls]\nStarlight Glimmer: Twilight!\n[magic zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: [straining]\nPony of Shadows: [roars]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh! The shadow won't let go of him. He wants to stop, but he can't do it alone.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Then we must help him!\n[magic shimmering]\nPony of Shadows: [roars, screams]\n[magic explodes]\n[whoosh]\nTwilight Sparkle: [grunts, sighs]\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! Oh, it felt sooooo good to do that again!\nPinkie Pie: Friendship power rush! Whoo!\nRarity: The Elements! They didn't disappear!\nFluttershy: Maybe because we used them for healing magic instead of banishing?\nApplejack: Look!\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Long ago, you needed our help, Stygian. But instead of listening, we turned our backs on you. Pride clouded my judgment. I owe you an apology. Thank you for helping us see the errors of our ways, Twilight. It seems I never accounted for the Magic of Friendship.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you, Swirlstar! Uh, Star Swirl!\n[cutie marks shimmering]\nStarlight Glimmer: [clears throat] Soooo... apparently a conversation can save Equestria?\nStar Swirl the Bearded: [chuckles] Something tells me I will be making a lot of apologies today.\n\nStar Swirl the Bearded: I simply cannot believe how tall you've gotten!\nPrincess Celestia: Well, it has been over a thousand years. Will you stay here and teach magic once again? My sister and I have such fond memories of your lessons.\nPrincess Luna: As long as you don't ask for those essays we owed you before you disappeared.\nPrincess Celestia: [giggles]\nStar Swirl the Bearded: [chuckles] I'm not certain Canterlot is where I belong. The realm has grown, and I believe I'll have a look around before I settle in any one place.\nMage Meadowbrook: And I long to see what has become of my home.\nMistmane: I believe we all do.\nPrincess Celestia: Then I hope you will return to Canterlot on occasion and share the wisdom of your great experience with the next generation of ponies.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: We would be honored. But if it is wisdom you seek, look no further than your own pupil. She showed me that the power of friendship is a magical force indeed. And that in turning away from others, you hurt yourself as well.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's funny. I thought meeting my idol would give me all the answers I ever wanted. But instead, I forgot what I already knew. Good thing I had a student of my own to remind me.\n\n[credits]\n"}]}, {"season": "8", "eps": [{"full_transcript": "\nTwilight Sparkle: This happened while we were gone?\nApplejack: Wow!

I invited her to come to Ponyville, but she wanted to spread the word of the Storm King's defeat and share what she learned about friendship.\nApplejack: Y'all think that's why the map grew? Friendship quests beyond Equestria?\nFluttershy: I hope not. I've had quite enough life-threatening adventures, thank you very much.\n[squeaking]\nPinkie Pie: How many friendship quests do you think we need to go on before we have to expand the throne room?\nTwilight Sparkle: We can't do it all alone.\nPinkie Pie: Sure we can! We just need to knock this wall down, get some paint...\nTwilight Sparkle: No. I mean, the world is filled with so many different creatures who know nothing about friendship. We need help if we're gonna teach them all about friendship. Lots of help.\nRarity: Perhaps. But where does one go to learn about friendship?\nTwilight Sparkle: Here! They can all go here!

Open seating? Or is that... too unstructured?\nPrincess Celestia: [giggles] Oh, Twilight. You were my star pupil. If anyone knows how to run a school, it's you.\nTwilight Sparkle: There's a big difference between attending a school and running one. It's not like there's a rule book to follow.\nPrincess Celestia: Actually, there is. The EEA guidebook is very specific about how to run a school.\nTwilight Sparkle: The EEA? I've never heard of that. Should I have heard of that?!\nPrincess Celestia: Of course not. You've never run a school before. The Equestria Education Association is a board of learned ponies that oversee every school in Equestria.\nSpike: Even your school? But you're you!\nPrincess Celestia: Not even a princess can do whatever she likes when it comes to shaping young pony minds. The EEA ensures that whether it's unicorns studying magic, Pegasi learning weather, or Earth ponies researching agriculture, all schools are held to the same high standard. They'll need to approve your plan before you can move forward.\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, Spike, looks like we have a presentation to make.\nSpike: [scoffs] After everything we've been through, how hard can that be?\n\n[deep chord]\nSpike: I'm gonna go with \"really hard\".\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, hello. My name is\u2014\nNeighsay: Princess Twilight Sparkle. I am Chancellor Neighsay. Equestria owes you a great debt.

Will you leave the school unattended to gallop off on your... \"adventures\"?\nTwilight Sparkle: My journey beyond Equestria showed me firsthoof that the threats out there are greater than we imagined!\n[EEA members hushed whispering]\nTwilight Sparkle: If we want to keep our land safe and create a friendlier tomorrow, we need to teach the Magic of Friendship far and wide.\nNeighsay: A school for ponies to learn how to protect themselves.\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, more like respecting differences and communicating.\n[long pause]\nNeighsay: The EEA concurs. Every pony should be prepared to defend our way of life. So, if your work is in order, provisional EEA approval is granted. We will need to observe your school up and running before it can be fully accredited.\nTwilight Sparkle: Then please, join us for Friends and Family Day. It'll be the perfect time to see our progress!\n[stamp]\n\n[various glints]\n[splashing]\n\nRainbow Dash: It's too much. Too much!\nRarity: Ugh, you think so?

I'm your teacher. I hope you enjoy class. But if you don't enjoy it, that's okay, too.\nApplejack: I don't know about all this.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's going to be fine. Everything about this school just feels right.\nStarlight Glimmer: See? If Twilight isn't stressed, you've got nothing to worry about.\nApplejack: And you're sure you want us to be teachers?

By boring him into surrender?\nOcellus: Our teachers are a little different than I expected.\nYona: Ugh! Pony school waste of time! Yak school teach how to braid yak hair! Braiding yak hair is best! Whoa!\n[thud]\nSmolder: Oof! Is there anything in Yakyakistan that isn't the best?\nYona: Yes! Wait. No! Yaks best.\nSmolder: No claws, no wings, no fire. What is it exactly you're proud of?\nSandbar: Whoa, cool it. No need to harsh Yona's love for her heritage, okay?\nGallus: Awww, are we not being sweet and friendly enough for you, pony?\nSilverstream: That was sarcasm, right? Because you weren't being sweet or nice!\nSmolder: Maybe dragons and griffons are just too tough for friendship.\nYona: Yaks tough, just not nasty.\nGallus: Who you calling nasty, klutz?\nGallus and Yona: [grunting]\nRainbow Dash: Okay, break it up! Break... it... up!\nStarlight Glimmer: What is going on here?!\nGallus: Just a friendly discussion about the magic of friendship amongst friends.\nApplejack: Everypony\u2014 I mean, everyone, go to your next class! I just can't believe it. Fights breakin' out when they're supposed to be learnin' friendship?\nStarlight Glimmer: Things definitely aren't going as \"by the book\" as Twilight planned.\nRainbow Dash: That's because we're terrible teachers! Face it. This school isn't gonna work.\n\nApplejack: [fading in] ...fights breakin' out in the hallway...\n[other main characters talking over each other]\nPinkie Pie: ...putting myself to sleep!\nRainbow Dash: I don't look like that, do I?\nPinkie Pie: [snores]\nTwilight Sparkle: I get it. Things are getting off to a rougher start than expected. But that's okay!\nSpike: Who are you, and what have you done with Twilight Sparkle?\nTwilight Sparkle: Every school in Equestria follows these rules. As long as we do too, we'll be fine.\nStarlight Glimmer: Maybe we should... try something new?\nTwilight Sparkle: The EEA will be here this afternoon for Friends and Family Day. They need to see a school that follows their guidelines.\nFluttershy: Even if those guidelines aren't working?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, then we have to try harder and make sure they do.\n[bell rings]\nTwilight Sparkle: Another morning, another chance to inspire our students!\n[door opens]\n\nSandbar: Hey! Professor Dash's class is this way.\nOcellus: Where are you going? You're not [gasps] skipping, are you?\nSmolder: That's exactly what we're doing.\nSilverstream: But Friends and Family Day\u2014\nGallus: Is after class. Relax. This is just a quick... mental health break.\nOcellus, Silverstream, and Yona: [whispering]\nSilverstream: That sounds legit! We're in!\nSandbar: I guess I'll tag along, too.

What are you all doing? Aren't classes that way?\nOcellus: Ah\u2014 [clears throat] A generosity field trip, daaaaarling.

Wait, what did you say about me?\n[students giggling]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: You're sure sticking to the book is gonna work?\nTwilight Sparkle: My friends can handle anything. They'll have these problems turned around before we know it.\nNeighsay: Problems?\nTwilight Sparkle and Starlight Glimmer: [gasps]\nTwilight Sparkle: Chancellor Neighsay! You're here!\nNeighsay: Yes. And you seem unprepared. If there are problems...\n[scribbling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Problems? Ha! Of course not! We can't wait to show you around!\n[scribbling]\nTwilight Sparkle: [chuckles nervously]\n\nGallus: And that's why griffons breathe fire when we get mad.\nSilverstream: They do not! Wait! Do they? No! Really?!\nYona: Griffons just full of hot air!\n[students laughing]\nSmolder: And yaks are actually good at jokes. How about that?\nOcellus: What are dragons good at?\nSmolder: Competition! Who's up for a race?\n\n[skidding brakes]\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash! Why aren't you in class teaching?\nRainbow Dash: Because my students are gone! Uh, g-gone somewhere else! Doing a loyalty lesson! And-and I was just going to grab, uh... this pencil! Because they need it. Wherever they are. Which I know, 'cause... I'm the teacher!\nTwilight Sparkle: I see. [laughs nervously] Well, Chancellor, we have other classes. We can just\u2014\nNeighsay: Let's follow the professor. I'm quite curious about this lesson in loyalty.\n\n[students laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: [voiceover] Of course, we want to instill a sense of loyalty towards others. We encourage acts of generosity and kindness.\n[students yelping]\nGallus: Figured we shouldn't be the only ones enjoying the view.\nYona: Waaaah! Yak not best at flying!\nTwilight Sparkle: [voiceover] And appreciation for the value of laughter...\nYona: Flying is best!\nSilverstream: Congratulations, Yona! You are officially the weirdest thing I've seen so far!\nSmolder: What do you say, Ocellus? Can you be weirder than a flying yak?\n[changeling zap]\n[other students gasping]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: ...and to always be honest in any situation.\nNeighsay: Honesty is imperative. Princess, are we going in circles?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, look at the time! We'd better head to the lake for Friends and Family Day. I'm sure all the students and faculty will be there.\n\n[ponies chattering]\nPrince Rutherford: [laughs]\n[clink]\n[buzzing noise]\nEmber: What is that?!\n[shocked noises and screams]\nNeighsay: Aah!

This act of aggression against ponies\u2014!\nTwilight Sparkle: I-I'm so sorry, Chancellor. We clearly had some students get a little carried away.\nNeighsay: Those are students? But you said you were opening this school to protect Equestria! To defend ponies from... dangerous creatures who don't have our best interests at heart!\nTwilight Sparkle: My school teaches for all of us to work together through friendship.\nNeighsay: And how do you know these creatures won't take what they have learned here and use it against us?\nTwilight Sparkle: Friendship isn't just for ponies!\nNeighsay: It should be.\nPrince Rutherford: Unicorn think yaks no need friendship? Maybe yaks no need pony school!\nNeighsay: Well, perhaps you should return to your kind.\nEmber: \"Your kind\"?! Smolder, let's go!\nSeaspray: Queen Novo will want to hear of this!\nGrampa Gruff: Well, this place seemed lame anyways.\nThorax: [despondently] It's fine. We know not every pony sees us the way you do. We're used to it.\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Celestia helped me reach out to all the kingdoms! When she hears you closed the school because\u2014!\nNeighsay: Because you failed to meet the EEA's standards?\nTwilight Sparkle: What?!\nNeighsay: Irresponsible teachers, students skipping class, endangering ponies! Your school is a disaster. Perhaps if you had had higher standards for who was admitted, this could have been avoided. Regardless...\n[magic noises]\n[chains rattling]\nNeighsay: By order of the EEA, I am shutting this school...

I'm gonna tell you what you did wrong.\nTwilight Sparkle: What?!\nStarlight Glimmer: You gave up too easily.\n[beat]\nStarlight Glimmer: Hey, you made me a guidance counselor. That means tough love.\nTwilight Sparkle: Neighsay was right. I failed. The school was a disaster.\nStarlight Glimmer: So was I when you met me. But you showed me that when you know in your heart something is right, you stand up for it. You did that for me. Why not for this?\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't go against the EEA! They're in charge of all the schools in Equestria!\nStarlight Glimmer: And you're in charge of all the friendship in Equestria. Why should you let somepony else stop you from doing your job?\nTwilight Sparkle: But the EEA rulebook\u2014\n[splash]\nStarlight Glimmer: Doesn't matter! You can write your own rules! Because you are doing something new. Something important!\nTwilight Sparkle: You're right! Why we're doing this is way more important than how we're doing this!

The School of Friendship is back in business!\nRainbow Dash: What?!\nRarity: But why?!\nFluttershy: Oh, no.\nApplejack: Bad idea.\nPinkie Pie: Do we still get to guess?\nRainbow Dash: No offense, Twilight, but teaching at that school was the most boring, horrible, awful thing ever.\nApplejack: Uh, pretty sure she's gonna take offense to that.\nTwilight Sparkle: No, Rainbow Dash is right. I owe you all an apology. I was so focused on doing things the EEA way, I didn't listen to any of you. I'm sorry. I promise, this time, we'll run the school the way friends should \u2013 together.\nRarity: So... we'd be allowed to teach however we want to?\nFluttershy: No more scary pop quizzes?\nPinkie Pie: Confetti cannons for everycreature?\n[party cannons clanking]\nTwilight Sparkle: Whatever you need to teach the Elements of Harmony.\nPinkie Pie: Yippeeeee!\n[party cannons fire]\nApplejack: Well, in that case, we're behind you one hundred percent, Twilight.\nSpike: [clears throat] Just two small problems.

Yeah?\nPinkie Pie: [squee]\nRarity: We need to think like our students. If someone told us we would never see each other again, what would we do?\nPinkie Pie: Go someplace we could all hang out and eat lots and lots of cupcakes!\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: What?\nFluttershy: Sandbar was friends with all of the missing students... and he just got plenty of cupcakes.\nApplejack: Huh. He was at the farm this mornin' pickin' up a wagonload of apples...\nRarity: And I saw him in a shop buying pillows and blankets!\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] He must be taking all that stuff to the other students! We've gotta follow him!\n[smack]\n\nGallus: [laughing] Huh. This place is way cooler than I thought it'd be.\n[thud]\nSmolder: [chewing] Even I'm impressed.

If only my family back home could see it...\n[thump]\nSilverstream: [chewing]\nOcellus: I wish the other changelings could meet you all.

What is that thing?\nOcellus: [sighs] Am I the only one who didn't sleep through Professor Fluttershy's \"Critters of Comfort and Conflict\" class? It's a puckwudgie.

Did Professor Fluttershy say anything about how to beat puckwudgies in her lecture?!\nOcellus: Uh... I'm sorry, I can't remember!\nGallus: I'm gonna go ahead and guess it's not pillows, apples\u2014\n[needles flying]\nGallus: ...or cupcakes.\nSilverstream: Wouldn't class have been about how to make friends with them?\nSandbar: Uh, guys? They're getting really close...\nYona: Yona not scared! Yona have friends!\n[puckwudgies gnashing]\n[whoosh]\nGallus: Is that Professor Egghead?!\n[magic noises]\nSpike: Aw, yeah!\n[puckwudgie noises]\nFluttershy: Oh! Don't hurt them! Just ask them to leave nicely.\n[thunk]\n[fuse burning]\n[party cannon fires]\n[fireworks exploding]\nYona: Not bad! [quickly] For pony.\nOcellus: Wow! They're amazing!\nGallus: I had no idea our teachers were actually cool.\nSandbar: [chuckles] I've been trying to tell you!\nSilverstream: Did you see that?! Rainbow Dash was like voooooom and then werrrrr, and the puckwudgies went flying! And then the birds came and\u2014!\nSmolder: Yeah, we all just lived it. But you're right. That was pretty amazing. Even by dragon standards.\n[puckwudgie noises]\nTwilight Sparkle: Is everycreature alright?\nStudents: [general agreement]\nSpike: [panting] You're lucky we got here in time!\nStarlight Glimmer: You know, this probably isn't the safest place for a campout.\nOcellus: Does that mean you're going to send us back to our homes?\nTwilight Sparkle: Not exactly. We have another option in mind.\nGallus: We're listening.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's pretty clear you've already started learning friendship without your teachers. But we'd like to show you even more... if you'd come back to school?\nSmolder: Not much of a choice.\nApplejack: To be honest, we felt exactly the same way when Twilight told us she was reopening the school.\nRarity: But this time, we guarantee it shall be different.\nRainbow Dash: Oh, yeah! With class run my way, it'll be two hundred and twenty percent cooler.\nFluttershy: And without the EEA\u2014\n[puckwudgie noise]\nFluttershy: \u2014it'll be much friendlier.\nPinkie Pie: Plus, all your nations won't go to war if you come back with us! Bonus!\n[beat]\nSandbar: Wait. What's happening?\n\n[magic noises]\nPrincess Celestia: Twilight! I was so relieved to get your letter!\nSeaspray: As was Queen Novo. Oh, we're just glad you're alright, Silverstream!\nGrampa Gruff: [to Gallus] Don't expect a welcome party from me, sonny! It's time you got home!\n[smack]\nGallus: I'm not leaving.\nGrampa Gruff: Whaaaat?!\nOcellus: None of us are. Sorry, Thorax.\nPrince Rutherford: Yak not understand.

You can't even get inside!\n[magic noises]\n[chains shattering]\nTwilight Sparkle: School is back in session!\nStudents: [cheering]\n[magic warbling]\nNeighsay: Who dared remove my seal?\nTwilight Sparkle: I did, Chancellor Neighsay! And I respectfully ask you to step aside, or classes will start late.\nNeighsay: Classes won't start at all! The EEA has spoken, and none shall pass!\n[boom!]\nYona: Yak pass if yak say! Hmph!\nNeighsay: This is for the greater good. The school was disorganized, the teachers unqualified! And those dangerous and unpredictable \"students\" put ponies' lives in danger!\nPrince Rutherford: [growls]\nEmber: [growls] I'll show you unpredictable!\nGrampa Gruff, Ember, Prince Rutherford, Seaspray, and Thorax: [shouting]\nPrincess Celestia: Hold on, please! I'm sure Princess Twilight Sparkle has a good explanation for all of this.\nTwilight Sparkle: I do! It's true that my School of Friendship is EEA-unaccredited...\nSpike: Look! She said it without doing the eye thing!\nNeighsay: Then it is not a school!\nTwilight Sparkle: It's not an EEA school. It's a friendship school with its own rules. I should know. I wrote the book!\n[thump]\nTwilight Sparkle: These students reminded me that every friendship is special, so the way we teach it has to be just as unique.

You, you, you!\nMudbriar: M'yes. M'yes. M'yes.\nPinkie Pie: I'm sorry. Let's start over. Hi, I'm Maud's sister, Pinkie Pie.\nMudbriar: I know.\nPinkie Pie: Sooooo... how did... you two meet?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] At a rock show.\nPinkie Pie: Oh! You're into rocks, too?\nMudbriar: No. I like sticks.\nPinkie Pie: Then why were you at a rock show?\nMudbriar: It was a petrified wood show, which technically makes it a stick show.\nMaud Pie: [deadpanly happy] Except that in the per-mineralization process of petrification, all organic material is replaced with silicates \u2013 i.e., rocks.\nMudbriar: While retaining the original structural elements of wood \u2013 q.e.d., it was a stick show.\nPinkie Pie: I'm... really into sticks, too! They're great for hitting pi\u00f1atas! Haaaaa...\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Pinkie...\nPinkie Pie: Oh! You wanna go first?\nMudbriar: That is stick abuse.\nPinkie Pie: It is? I'm sorry. Oh, this is awful. I'm not being a very good sister. Let's start over. I'm Pinkie Pie! Nice to meet you!\nMudbriar: Technically, we've already met.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] You should introduce Pinkie to your pet.\nPinkie Pie: Oh! Your pet likes fetch!\nMudbriar: This is my pet. So no.\nMaud Pie: [deadpanly happy] Aw. Look at Twiggy and Boulder playing together.\nMudbriar: They're adorable.\nPinkie Pie: [whispering, to Maud] It's just a stick.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Don't be rude.\nPinkie Pie: [sighs] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. One more time. I'm Pinkie Pie! [through gritted teeth] Nice to meet you!\nMudbriar: Technically, we've already met.\nPinkie Pie: [growls, snort]\n\nPinkie Pie: [straining] Daaah! I don't get this guy!\nStarlight Glimmer: Wow. Maud has a boyfriend?\nPinkie Pie: [groans] How could she like someone so weird? He has an inanimate object for a pet!\nStarlight Glimmer: So does Maud.\nPinkie Pie: Boulder has ten times the personality of some random stick! Mudbriar, too, for that matter. He's not like Maud at all! Maud is hilarious, friendly, caring, and easy to talk to!\nStarlight Glimmer: Yep, that's Maud.\nPinkie Pie: But this guy is awkward, quiet, and kind of... strange.\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, that also sounds like Maud.\nPinkie Pie: [laughs] You're so funny, Starlight! Maud is nothing like Mudbriar. If she were, then we wouldn't be best sister friends forever.\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, Maud obviously likes something about him.\nPinkie Pie: [groans]\nStarlight Glimmer: Maybe you just need to spend more time with him. Find out what you have in common.\nPinkie Pie: That's easy \u2013 nothing!\nStarlight Glimmer: You both care about Maud. I know. He could help you with her party.\nPinkie Pie: I guess...\nStarlight Glimmer: And I'll keep Maud busy while you and Mudbriar plan the best surprise birthday ever.\nPinkie Pie: That I can do!\n\nPinkie Pie: Listen. Maud's birthday is tomorrow, and there's no time to waste. You're not afraid of slides, are you?\nMudbriar: No. Whyyyyyyyyyyy??!\n[crash]\nMudbriar: Oof!\nPinkie Pie: No reason. Wheeeeeee!\n[crash]\nMudbriar: [groans]\nPinkie Pie: Welcome to my party planning cave!\nMudbriar: Technically, due to the speleothems growing from the ceiling, this is more of a cavern than a cave. Maud taught me that.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah, okay.\n[squeaking]\nPinkie Pie: Here's what I'm thinking for her surprise party \u2013 edible rock candy plates, gem-shaped ice cubes, a pebble pi\u00f1ata. Uh... we'll skip that one.\nMudbriar: Might I make some suggestions?\nPinkie Pie: Oh. Suggest away! That's why you're here! You and me! Planning... together! Friends!\nMudbriar: I have a vision board of everything Maud loves, and none of those things are on it.\nPinkie Pie: Hmph. Let me see this \"vision board\".\nMudbriar: It's not a physical thing. I'm envisioning it. [quietly] Om, I enter through the large door of my mind palace and enter to the back, where I have all of my books and possessions, and what do I encounter? The Maud Room. None of those things are there. [out loud] Just as I thought. Maud doesn't like surprises.\nPinkie Pie: Where does it say that? She never told me that!\nMudbriar: Mmm. It sounds like she was protecting your feelings. She's very caring that way.\nPinkie Pie: Stop acting like you know my sister better than me!\nMudbriar: Technically, I never said that.\nPinkie Pie: [angrily] Well, technically, I don't care! And since I've been best sister friends forever with Maud my entire life, I think I'm the expert here! Oh, but fine. If you don't believe me, let's ask her! [whispering] But we have to be super-sneaky.\nMudbriar: Can you be more specific?\nPinkie Pie: No!\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Huh. You must be Mudbriar.\n[beat]\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm Starlight Glimmer. Nice to meet you. I've heard great things!\n[beat]\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm so glad the two of you are spending time together. So... how's it going?\nPinkie Pie: Mudbriar and I have just spent the best time bonding! And we're really starting to make some headway becoming besties, except for one teensy-weensy disagreement that maybe you could settle, Maud. See, Mudbriar here seems to think that [starting to laugh] you don't like surprise parties! Isn't it funny how [suddenly angry] wrong he is?!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I like surprise parties...\nPinkie Pie: Hmmmm.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] ...because I know they make you happy when you throw them for me.\nPinkie Pie: See? Wait, what?!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I'd rather just do something small with you, Starlight, Boulder, and Mudbriar for my birthday.\nPinkie Pie: No party? No party?! Did he put you up to this?!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Mm-mm.\nPinkie Pie: [whispering] Maybe you should consider, I don't know, taking things a little less serious with Mudbriar because he's kinda sort of... [loudly] impossible to like?!\nStarlight Glimmer: Hey, Mudbriar, have you ever flown a kite? Let me tell you all about it. See, the first thing you should do is\u2014\nPinkie Pie: I just can't believe you would choose sitting around with him over a party with your own sister!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I didn't choose either of you. Technically, I said I wanted to be with both of you.\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] \"Technically\"?! Ugh, you even like the way he talks?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Everything about him makes me happy.\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] [tearing up] Then I guess you don't need a best sister friend forever anymore.\nMaud Pie: [deadpanly concerned] Pinkie...\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, wait, let's all slow down and talk about this.\nPinkie Pie: No! [crying]\nMudbriar: See you later!\n\nPinkie Pie: [crying] I don't understand! How could Maud like Mudbriar? Is it Opposite Day? Nothing makes sense!\nFluttershy's apparition: I'm not shy, and I hate animals!\nRarity's apparition: Fashion?! Not for me, darling!\nApplejack's apparition: Peh! An apple a day is downright disgusting!\nRainbow Dash's apparition: Slow and steady wins the race!\nTwilight Sparkle's apparition: I never learned to read!\nMane five's apparitions: [laughing]\nPinkie Pie: What if I don't like cupcakes?! [screams]\n\n[rooster crows]\nPinkie Pie: Good morning! Oh, wait. Bad morning. [groans]\n[door opens]\nLimestone Pie: Get out of bed, sis. If you're gonna be here, you gotta work.\nPinkie Pie: Ohhh.\n\n[pickaxe clinking]\nPinkie Pie: You're probably wondering why I came back to the family farm in the middle of the night.\nMarble Pie: Mm-hmm.\nPinkie Pie: Well, it all started when\u2014\nLimestone Pie: Less talking, more farming!\nPinkie Pie: [sad groan] It's just... Maud has a boyfriend.\nLimestone Pie: I'm not jealous! Who said anything about jealous?!\nPinkie Pie: Don't be! He's super-duper weird! And somehow, he tricked Maud into liking him. And now I'll never get to see her again! [sighs] I came home because you two know her better than anypony. What am I missing? What does she see in him? [tearing up] What does he have that I don't?! [starts bawling]\nLimestone Pie: Buck up, Pinkie Pie. You look as miserable as I feel all the time.\nPinkie Pie: [sniffs]\n[splash]\nPinkie Pie: It's just that I love Maud, and I want to love Mudbriar, but I can't see anything to like about him!\n[beat]\nLimestone Pie: Ugh, fine! We're taking a work break. Come on!\n\nLimestone Pie: I'm looking at a sparkling bright blue and white rock. See it?\nPinkie Pie: You mean that lumpy grey one?\nLimestone Pie: No, the beautiful blue and white one. Right there.\nPinkie Pie: I would not describe that as beautiful, blue, or white, but... [laughs nervously] Okay.\nLimestone Pie: [to Marble] Show her.\n[rock cracks]\n[glistening]\nLimestone Pie: It's a geode! The outside looks like a regular rock, but the inside is filled with beautiful gems.\nPinkie Pie: So you're saying I should crack open Mudbriar like a rock! It all makes sense! No, wait. It doesn't.\nLimestone Pie: It's a metaphor, Pinkie! You see Mudbriar as a rock, but Maud sees him as a gem. Even if you never see past his dullness, you can see how happy he makes Maud. And to a sister, that's all that matters.\nMarble Pie: Mm-hmm!\n[rock clinks]\nPinkie Pie: Oh, Limestone, Marble, thank you! I don't know what I'd do without you two! Pie pile!\n[thud]\nLimestone Pie: Okay, okay! You're crushing me to gravel, Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie: I really owe Mudbriar an apology. [gasps] And I owe Maud a party! I just hope I'm not too late!\n\n[paper rustling]\n[whirring hooves]\nPinkie Pie: I brought you an olive branch to say sorry. I was really unfair to you, and I'm ready to listen to your ideas for Maud's birthday, if you still want to plan it together.\nMudbriar: Technically, this isn't even an olive branch. It's a quercus, most likely castaneifolia.\nPinkie Pie: Oh, come on! [through gritted teeth] Sorry! Keeping it together...!\nMudbriar: And I love a good quercus. Friends?\nPinkie Pie: Friends!

He said the best present would be me throwing you a surprise party you didn't have to go to.\nMudbriar: Technically, it wasn't a surprise because she could see the pre-party preparations from up here.\nPinkie Pie: [through gritted teeth] Technically...

What can I help you with?\nBracer Britches: What's the thread count of this shirt? I can't be seen in anything less than a thousand.\nFluttershy: Um, thread... count? Um... Well, I'm not sure. Let's see... Um, one, two, three, four...\n[raccoons chittering]\nFluttershy: Um, excuse me for just one second. [pants]\n[raccoons chittering]\nFluttershy: Oh, I'm afraid I don't know much about fashion to satisfy these customers. What am I gonna do?\n[raccoons chittering]\nFluttershy: Oh, I've never tried to act before, but... I suppose it's worth a shot.\n\nFluttershy: [clears throat, snooty voice] Severe but not unapproachable. Acceptable business attire. [normal voice] Oh, does that sound like a shop pony to you?\n[raccoons chittering]\n\nFluttershy: [snooty voice] So sorry for the wait. The shop has some... staffing issues today.\nBracer Britches: Yes, well, I still haven't had an answer on this thread count.\nFluttershy: Here at Rarity For You, our merchandise defies typical attempts to quantify its quality, but rest assured, it will make you the envy of all who see it.\nBracer Britches: Oh, in that case, I'll take three!\n[ka-ching!]\nFluttershy: Ta-ta!\n[door opens, closes]\nFluttershy: [normal voice, sighs, faints, pants, sighs] Smoky Jr., I can't believe it worked! [snooty voice] I suppose clothes really do make the pony after all.\n\nLuckette: I don't know about you, but I have a full day of shopping planned. And if even one shop pony isn't up to my standards, well, I shall make my displeasure quite plain.\nStrawberry Ice: Oh, you are wicked! [laughing]\nRarity: Canterlot fashion show or no, I simply can't leave Fluttershy to fend for herself with these Manehattanites. [panting]\nBracer Britches: Rarity?\n[screech]\nRarity: Oh, darling, I'm afraid I can't stop. Potential emergency at the boutique.\nBracer Britches: Oh, well, whatever it is, I'm quite certain the pony you left in charge can handle it. Oh, she's simply divine!\nRarity: Oh, well, I always knew Fluttershy had it in her. [laughs] And there's still time to catch the train to Canterlot!\n\nFluttershy: [snooty voice] It's an unique play on the old standard. We call it a Rarity cut with a triple-cut stitched hem and a guacamole chevka pattern fabric.\nSilver Berry: Don't you mean \"chevron\"?\nFluttershy: If I had meant \"chevron\", then that's what I would've said.\nSilver Berry:  [chuckles] Of course. It's so unique! So en vogue! It must be mine!\n[ka-ching!]\n[raccoons chittering]\nFluttershy: [normal voice] Aw, thanks, everyone. But I feel I should push the snootiness further.\n[raccoons chittering]\nFluttershy: If you really wanna help, I suppose serving tea would be nice. Oh, if you don't mind.\n\n[tea pouring]\nOld Money: I like my accessories bold and shiny, and I'm just not seeing anything nearly bold and shiny enough.\nFluttershy: [snooty voice] I'm afraid bold and shiny won't work with your whole... modelle. Perhaps... pointy.\nOld Money: Pointy? Yes! I must have pointy!\nFluttershy: Not everypony can pull off a found object, but you... nearly get there.\n[ka-ching!]\nValley Trend: [millennial accent] I need, like, a red carpet glitz-and-glamour gown that's also casual, but, like, still artsy and a total head-turner.\nFluttershy: Yes. Casual chic pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter is very branch\u00e9 this season.\nValley Trend: Uhhh... Like, I don't understand any of that, so, like... I don't care about it?\nFluttershy: Um, one moment, please.\n[zip!]\n[raccoons chitter]\nFluttershy: [normal voice] Oh, I think I need a new character.\n\nFluttershy: [hipster voice] Okay, I've got, like, this high-key savage look for you? It's a totally live ensemble with a little, like, thingies that sparkle and make the whole squad go, \"Whoa! That pony is 'woke'!\"\nValley Trend: That is, like, exactly what I need!\n[raccoons chitter]\n\n\"Snow Hope\": This store is a desperate wasteland of nothingness. Do you have anything in black?\nFluttershy: [hipster voice] Can you, like, chill for one sec? BRB.\n[zip!]\n\nFluttershy: [goth voice] It's not like the futility of shopping can be made better with black leather and metal studs, but they help.\n\"Snow Hope\": Uh.... that jacket completes me.\nJoan Pommelway: [spits] [British accent] This tea's, like, lukewarm. It's barely drinkable.\nFluttershy: [snooty voice] This tea must always be at a precise temperature! See that it doesn't happen again!\n[raccoon chitter sadly]\nFluttershy: [hipster voice] Whoa, that color is, like, almost too lit for you? [goth voice] The blackness of this vest is a reflection of your soul. [snooty voice] This hemline is nothing short of an inspiration of craftsponyship. Are you sure you deserve it?\n[music]\n[hoof pounding]\n[raccoons chittering]\n[slow motion sounds]\n[splash]\nFluttershy: [gasps]\nMare E. Lynn: [screaming]\nFluttershy: [snooty voice] I don't know what's worse \u2013 that you spilled the tea or that it's still cold! Either get it right or go back to the forest!\n[racoons chittering angrily]\n[dishes clatter]\nFluttershy: Oh, it is so hard to find good help these days.\n\n[raccoons chittering]\nSpike: Okay! Okay! Slow down, everyone! I'm doing my best!\n[raccoons chittering]\nSpike: So, Rarity is busy at an important fashion show, and Fluttershy is running her shop in Manehattan, but to do it, she's playing different shop pony characters that are all mean?\n[raccoons chittering happily]\nTwilight Sparkle: How in the world did you figure that out, Spike?\nSpike: I'm not Dragon Charades champion for nothin'!\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't imagine Fluttershy would ever be mean to her animal friends. This sounds serious. Spike, tell everyone it's time to head back to Saddle Row!\n[raccoons chittering]\n\nFluttershy: [snooty voice] I wouldn't think it was possible to make something so dowdy even more matronly, but here you are. [goth voice] It's like a scream in the void, empty and ultimately meaningless. [hipster voice] I would srsly help you right now, but, like, I don't wanna, you know?\n[raccoons chittering]\nTwilight Sparkle: You weren't kidding. This is worse than we thought! She's being horrible to everypony!\nApplejack: Uh, are you sure that's even Fluttershy?\nPinkie Pie: Maybe it's just three really, really fast ponies that really, really look like her!\nRainbow Dash: Well, let's find out! Hey, Fluttershy? Are you running the shop or performing in a one-pony show?\nFluttershy: [snooty voice] If you don't mind, I can only improve the taste of one customer at a time. You'll have to wait your turn. Ugh, honestly! These small town ponies come to the big city and think they can behave any way they please!\nRainbow Dash: What?! You are a small-town pony! And your cottage isn't even in the town!\nApplejack: Look, Fluttershy, we came here because we were worried and we care about you.\nFluttershy: [goth voice, to Neigh Sayer] Let's get out of this aura of positivity before it consumes us.\nPinkie Pie: As fun as this Fluttershy switcheroo game is, Smoky, Smoky Jr., and Softpad are really concerned.\nSpike: Yeah! They came all the way to Ponyville to get us.\n[raccoons chittering]\nFluttershy: [hipster voice] They should have, like, stayed there? The shop is, like, a no-rodent zone now.\nApplejack, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Twilight Sparkle, and Spike: [gasps]\n[raccoons gasping]\nPinkie Pie: She called them \"rodents\"?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy, I understand why you think you have to act this way for these customers, but there's gotta be a better way.\nFluttershy: [snooty voice] [sarcastically] Goodness! You are so right. Please, step this way so that we may discuss your concerns.\nTwilight Sparkle: I knew you'd come to your senses!\n[door slams]\nFluttershy: [snooty voice] Indeed.\n\n[crowd muttering]\nRarity: Ugh, the centerpiece of my collection, and it's still not right! Oh, darling, I'm afraid we've literally run out of time. It's up to you! Go out there and sell it! Now, attitude!\n[ponies cheering, cameras clicking]\n\nRarity: I don't understand. When I left Fluttershy, she had everything well in hoof.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, things might have seemed all right when you left, but they're definitely not all right now.\nApplejack: She's actin' worse than the worst Manehattanite I ever saw!\nRainbow Dash: She kicked us out of the shop!\nPinkie Pie: She called Smoky, Smoky Jr., and Softpad... \"rodents\"!\nRarity: Wh-wh-wha... Rodents?! Well, why didn't you say that from the start?! She obviously needs help! Come on!\n\nFluttershy: [goth voice] Your melancholy is way too shallow for a look with this much unfeeling depth.\n\"Snow Hope\": Huh.\nFluttershy: [hipster voice] Ugh! Your style isn't even on the same page? Turn away. Don't even look at it, okay?\nValley Trend: [gasps] I can't even!\n[magic noises]\n[hooks sliding]\nFluttershy: [snooty voice] I think not, dear! This is all far too fashion forward for the likes of you!\nBracer Britches: Ugh! Well, I never!\n[door opens]\n[door slams]\nApplejack: [sighs] Told ya it was bad.\nRarity: Bad? This is worse than I could've possibly imagined!\nFluttershy: [snooty voice] Rarity! I'm so glad you're here! [kissing noises] Finally, a pony who understands that the couture in this shop is far too brilliant to even consider selling!\nRarity: Whaaat?!\nFluttershy: [hipster voice] You, like, totally get how lame customers are? Ugh! [goth voice] Watching them leave filled me with a sweet sadness. [snooty voice] And you'll be pleased to hear that I've taken care of your rodent situation.\n[raccoons chittering]\nPinkie Pie: Will somebody tell her to stop saying that?!\nRarity: That's it! Fluttershy, I'm afraid you've left me no choice! You are terminated!\nFluttershy: [snooty voice] Well! Good luck replacing me! Humph!\nRarity: [sighs] Well, thankfully I\u2014 [shrieks]\nFluttershy: [goth voice] I always thought she was too controlling.\nRarity: You\u2014 you\u2014 you are terminated, too!\nFluttershy: [goth voice] Whatever.\nRarity: Now, I\u2014 [shrieks]\nFluttershy: [hipster voice] I know, right? I mean, uh, ugh?\nRarity: Actually, you're, like, totally terminated as well!\nFluttershy: [hipster voice] Like, okay.\nRarity: [sighs] Well, I'm glad that's over\u2014 [shrieks]\nFluttershy: [normal voice] I guess I owe everypony an apology.\nRarity: [sighs] You think?\nFluttershy: I got so caught up trying to please all of your customers that\u2014\nRainbow Dash: What customers?\nFluttershy: I might have taken my salespony characters a little too far.\n[pumping]\nFluttershy: [to raccoons] I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. You know I was only pretending, right?\n[raccoons chittering]\nTwilight Sparkle: But, Fluttershy, why did you think you needed to be somepony else to run the shop?\nFluttershy: I guess acting like the ponies of Saddle Row gave me the confidence to interact with them.\nRarity: Darling, I'd never trust some horrible Saddle Row pony to run my shop. That's why I wanted a friend to do it.\nFluttershy: Well, I'd definitely rather be myself anyway, even if I don't exactly have what it takes to be a shop pony.\nTwilight Sparkle: I wouldn't sell yourself short. Those salespony characters all came from you!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! I think you totally have what it takes.\nPinkie Pie: Maybe a little too much.\nRarity: Indeed. You have all the inner strength you need, but I think we prefer it coming from our sweet, regular Fluttershy.\nApplejack, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight Sparkle: [laughing]\nRarity: And that's just given me the inspiration I'm looking for!\n\nRarity: And last one... There! The missing piece for my new collection \u2013 the Warrior of Inner Strength!\n[mane cast and ponies cheering and applauding]\n[raccoons chittering]\nPony: Oh, gorgeous!\nFluttershy: Oh, it's lovely, Rarity! I'm just sorry you had to leave the Canterlot Royal Fashion Show early.\nRarity: Oh, darling, making the perfect dress is scads more satisfying than showing it off.\n[customers chattering]\nBlueberry Curls: Ooh, striking dress, Rarity. I certainly hope you aren't trying to undercut the Royal Fashion Show by ducking out and debuting it here.\nRarity: What? No, I\u2014\nFluttershy: [snooty voice] Have you considered the possibility that the Royal Fashion Show is trying to undercut Rarity's by continuing on in Canterlot and not moving the whole affair here?! Hmm?! Have you?! Hmmm?!\nBlueberry Curls: I, uh... No.\nFluttershy: [snooty voice] Hmph! Just as I thought! Hmmm!\n[beat]\nFluttershy: [to Rarity] Oh! [giggles] Inner strength.\nFluttershy and Rarity: [laughing]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nSoarin: I'm sooo glad I made it to Las Pegasus before the fastest, most thrilling ride of all time closes for good!\nRainbow Dash: Wait. The fastest, most thrilling ride of all time?\nMisty Fly: [gasps] She hasn't heard of the Wild Blue Yonder?\nRainbow Dash: [scoffs] Of course I have! It's that one where, uh... All right, you got me. What is it?\nSoarin: Only the coolest rollercoaster ever!\nMisty Fly: [scoffs] You can't really call yourself a Wonderbolt if you haven't been on it.\nRainbow Dash: It looks incredible!\nSoarin: Oh, it is. First, you strap yourself into the cloud rocket car, and then you're catapulted straight through a...\n\nRainbow Dash: ...series of daring dips and terrifying turns...\n\nRainbow Dash: ...flipping upside-down so many times you don't know which way is up!\n\nRainbow Dash: 'Til finally you climb to the highest peak on the rails! Then drop towards the ground at lightning speed...\n\nRainbow Dash: ...before coming up to a screeching halt! It's the coolest ride ever to exist in the history of Equestria!\nApplejack: So, when did you ride it?\nRainbow Dash: Oh. [laughs] I haven't.\nApplejack: [sighs]\n\n[theme song]\n\nApplejack: [grunts]\nRainbow Dash: The ride closes this week! Forever! But I can't go to Las Pegasus because I have to teach at Twilight's school. I'm gonna miss out on the coolest rollercoaster of all time! Unless...\nApplejack: Why do I feel like you're about to ask me a mighty big favor?\nRainbow Dash: Can you cover my classes? [whimper]\nApplejack: Absolutely!\nRainbow Dash: Really? Awesome! [whoosh, grunts]\nApplejack: On one condition. You tag along with a few other ponies goin' to Las Pegasus.\nRainbow Dash: [laughs] Surely you don't mean Granny Smith!\nApplejack: No, no, of course not. I mean Granny Smith and the rest of the Gold Horseshoe Gals.\nGranny Smith: Hurry your haunches, hinnies!\nApplejack: Grand Auntie Applesauce, cousin Apple Rose, and cousin Goldie Delicious.\n[cat meows]\nApplejack: Why, I'm sure they'd be plumb tickled to have you join their annual grandmares' trip to Las Pegasus. It'll be perfect. I'll teach your classes, and you can look after them for me.\nRainbow Dash: [scoffs] Look after them?\nApplejack: So they don't get too carried away. Usually Big Mac goes along as a chaperone, but I'm sure he'd love a break.\n[drag, snap, meow]\nRainbow Dash: There is no way I'm going to Las Pegasus with a bunch of old, slow grannies!\nApplejack: So you don't mind missin' your only chance to ride the Wild Blue Yonder?\nRainbow Dash: Ugh, fine! I'll go!\nApplejack: Ha! That's the spirit! Now skedaddle so I can help them get ready.\nGranny Smith: Applejack! Have you seen my cranky flank cream? I can't find it in this whole tootin' farmhouse.\nApplejack: It's, uh, gonna take a while.\n\n[clock chimes]\nRainbow Dash: [groaning] Why is this taking so long? The Wild Blue Yonder's gonna close before we even get to Las Pegasus.\nApplejack: Here. I made a list to help you keep the grandmares out of trouble. Don't wanna have to bring 'em back home before you get to go on your rollercoaster.\nRainbow Dash: That could happen?!\nApplejack: Only if you don't follow the rules. These grannies need a lot of care. If one of 'em overdoes it, it's bye-bye Las Pegasus for the lot of ya.\nRainbow Dash: [reading] \"Make sure they get their naps\". \"Eat only soft foods\". \"Careful when dancing\"? \"Don't get too excited\"? Seriously?!\nApplejack: And don't let 'em out of your sight. Ever.\nRainbow Dash: Wait. Then how am I supposed to go on the rollercoaster?\nApplejack: You'll find time. And you might even learn a thing or two about havin' a good time from these old gals.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah. That'll happen.\nApplejack: All right, y'all! Time to get this show on the road! [chuckles] Or in the sky, in this case.\n[grannies chattering]\nRainbow Dash: [groans] Come on, come on, come on!\n[cats meowing]\nRainbow Dash: [groans]\n[whooshing]\nRainbow Dash: Go, go, go, go, go!\n\nRainbow Dash: Argh! Everypony okay in there?\nGranny Smith: Dandy as a pansy in a plant pot!\nApple Rose: You know, this hot air balloon ride reminds me of the time I climbed a tree. Have I ever told you that story?\nAuntie Applesauce: Only about a million times.\nApple Rose: Huh? What did you say?\nRainbow Dash: [echoing] They said they've heard the tree story!\nApple Rose: Oh, you wanna hear the tree story? Okay.\nGoldie Delicious: Here we go again.\nApple Rose: Back when I was a young filly, I was afraid of tree-climbin'. These knockin' hooves sweatin'. Have you ever had the hoof sweats? Well, they're just the worst thing. You know, cousin Strudel \u2013 she used to get 'em too. Now, of course she was a champion fritter... [fades out]\n\n[distant cheers]\nRainbow Dash: The Wild Blue Yonder is in our hotel?! Uh, I bet you grannies are feeling super tired from your journey.\nGranny Smith: Nope! How about a trot down the avenue to see the sights, girls?\nGoldie Delicious: Oh, forget the sights! I came here to play some serious horseshoe toss!\nApple Rose: Oh, can we see the rainbow fountains at the water show? They're so magical!\nAuntie Applesauce: My pores are crying for a mud mask at the Prism Palace Spa!\nRainbow Dash: You know what would be really fun? Relaxing in our room! Come on. Last one to the hotel is a rotten apple! [whoosh] Let me get that for ya. [grunting]\n\n[distant cheering]\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh! There it is! The best rollercoaster ever!\nGoldie Delicious: Aaah! Warm up those withers, ladies! There's a horseshoe-hurlin' trophy with our names on it!\nGrannies: [groaning]\nApplejack vision: [ghostly voice] Don't let them get too excited! Or you'll have to go hooooooome!\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. That sounds a little too exciting. Why don't we get you checked in first?\nAuntie Applesauce: Oh, my.

[chuckles] Thank you, ma'am.\nAuntie Applesauce: I think he was sweet on me. Maybe I should ask him to accompany me to the magic show tonight.\nGranny Smith: Ha-ha! You sure your name's not Applesaucey? Better find the brakes on that buggy, sugar. We just got here.\nAuntie Applesauce: You're right. Better see what else is out there first. The day is young, and I am not!\nGrannies: [giggling]\nRainbow Dash: Uh, Granny Smith's right. Let's not overdo it. How about a nice nap so you can really enjoy Las Pegasus?\nGoldie Delicious: [yawns] Good idea. We could use some shut-eye, hmm?\nApple Rose: But I'm not tired. Uh, oh, right! Uh, yaaaawn.\nGrannies: [yawning]\nGranny Smith: You go along now and explore while we rest, sugar booger. Yawn.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, if you say so! [to Lemon Squeezy] What? They'll be in here sleeping the whole time I'm gone!\n[beat]\nRainbow Dash: Quit judging me!\n[door closes]\n\nRainbow Dash: [clears throat] One ticket for the coolest rollercoaster of all time, please.

They didn't even know I left.\n[cat meows]\nRainbow Dash: Whoa!\n[cat meows]\nRainbow Dash: Aah! [gasps] They're gone!\n\nRainbow Dash: [panicked whimpering] Granny Smith! Apple Rose! Are you here?! Applesauce? Goldie? Oh, I'm the worst chaperone ever!\nApplejack vision: [ghostly voice] Don't let them out of your siiiiiiiiight!\nRainbow Dash: I know, I know! Excuse me, sir. Have you seen a group of old mares around here?\n\"Tight End\": Lady, you just described half the ponies in this place.\nRainbow Dash: [groans] This place is huge! They could be anywhere!\nCrowd: [chanting] Goldie! Goldie! Goldie! Goldie! Goldie! Goldie!\nCarnival Barker: Can they do it? Can good old Goldie Delicious and the Gold Horseshoe Gals break the all-time resort record, folks?\n[clang]\nCrowd: [cheers]\nGoldie Delicious: Now that's how you hurl a horseshoe!\nRainbow Dash: Ha! No way! Goldie's totally got game!\nCarnival Barker: Make some noise for the best-played game of horseshoes this resort has ever seen! Can you believe your eyes, folks?\n[crowd cheering]\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! Go, Goldie!\nCarnival Barker: Stand back! She's getting excited!\nRainbow Dash: Huh? Uh-oh!\nGoldie Delicious: Oh, oop!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, mind if I try?\n[clank]\nRainbow Dash: Whoops. Guess I'm no good at this game. Sorry.\nCarnival Barker: And the Gold Horseshoe Gals are out! Looks like the show's over, everypony.\nCrowd: Awww! [groaning]\nRainbow Dash: Oh, I'm so glad I found you! Everypony feeling okay? Not too excited?\nGoldie Delicious: Pretty much the opposite right now.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Good. From now on, I'm not letting you grannies out of my sight.\nAuntie Applesauce: In that case, let's paint the town candy apple red!\nGoldie Delicious: Ooh! We could play more games!\nApple Rose: Or go shopping for hats! Have I ever told you about the time I got a new hat, and it turned out to be a bird? [laughs]\nGranny Smith: That's what we ought to do!\nRainbow Dash: Really?\nGranny Smith: Hit the buffet! All that horseshoe tossin' sure works up an appy-tite.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Uh-huh...\n\nGranny Smith: I love me some nachos. I'mma set my dentures loose on these vittles until the crumbs cry uncle!\nApplejack vision: [ghostly voice] They can only eat soft foods! You're a nacho away from no rolly-coaster!\n[whoosh, clang]\nGranny Smith: [exclamation of surprise]\nRainbow Dash: Come on, Granny. You know you can't have those. They're super crunchy.\n[clang]\n[whoosh]\nRainbow Dash: How about some nice soft carrot soup, instead?\nGranny Smith: I thought you was supposed to be the fun one.\nRainbow Dash: Wait. I am fun!\nCarnival Barker: [over P.A.] Attention all, thrill-seekers! There's only one day left to ride the ride of all rides, the Wild Blue Yonder, before it's gone for good! Get in line! Now!\nRainbow Dash: [anxious groan] So... what does everypony want to do tonight? I was thinking go to our room and put on eye masks and earplugs? [crunching]\nAuntie Applesauce: I'd rather hit the club and show off my dance moves. I'm quite a legend when it comes to rumba.\nGrannies: [agreement]\nRainbow Dash: Sounds kind of intense. Aren't you all exhausted from your big day?\nGoldie Delicious: Heck no! We save up our energy all year for Las Pegasus weekend, isn't that right, girls?\nAuntie Applesauce, Apple Rose, and Granny Smith: Mmm-hmm!\nRainbow Dash: Ugh. Dancing it is, then. I'll be there.\n[splat]\n\n[trance-like music]\nApplejack vision: [ghostly voice] Careful when daaaaaanciiiiing!\nRainbow Dash: Ugh! Stop doing that! Uh, that's probably enough dancing for now! Right, Apple Rose?\nApple Rose: Oh, that was just my warm-up.\nAuntie Applesauce: Look! It's our favorite magicians, Big Bucks and Jack Pot! And aren't they lookin' handsome as ever?\nJack Pot: [laughs, ahem] You little fillies have got some smooth moves!\nGrannies: [giggling]\nBig Bucks: Say, how would you Gold Horseshoe Gals like to bring some of that good energy into our magic show tonight?\nJack Pot: Here's five complimentary VIP tickets to our most amazing trick in the Pone Fantastique Theater, just over there.\nAuntie Applesauce: Sugarcube, we never miss your show.\nJack Pot: Fabulous. We'll save a spot for you on stage.\nBig Bucks: And in our hearts.\nRainbow Dash: So gross.\nGrannies: [cheering]\nGranny Smith: Yeehaw, girls! Applesauce landed us some Very Important Pony tickets for the show tonight! [chuckles]\nGrannies: [laughing and giggling]\nRainbow Dash: Oh, come on! You said you were going back to the room after dancing! So each pony could have some alone time?\nGoldie Delicious: Oh, now don't be a stick in the mud! Trust me, you'll loooove this show! It's the best thing in Las Pegasus!\n[grannies cheering]\n\"Cranberry Muffin\": Oh, hey! Thanks for giving me your place in line. They said I'm one of the last ponies ever to ride the Wild Blue Yonder! Ha!\n\n[applause]\nBig Bucks: And now, for the trick that made us famous!\nJack Pot: The most dangerous magical feat known to ponykind.\n[music]\nJack Pot: We'd like to invite some very special mares to the stage.\nAuntie Applesauce: That's our cue, girls!\nRainbow Dash: Hey, where are you going? Come back!\nBig Bucks: Meet our lovely assistants!\n[applause]\nJack Pot: They will make a splashtastic escape using only the instructions we give them... with our minds.\nCrowd: [oohs]\nBig Bucks: Don't try this at home, folks!\n[hatch opens, water flowing]\nRainbow Dash: [gasps]\nApplejack vision: [normal voice] Do I really have to say anything?\nRainbow Dash: Release those grannies, right now!\nCrowd: [shocked gasps]\nRainbow Dash: [grunting]\n[creaking]\n[splash!]\nCrowd: [gasps]\nGranny Smith: What'd ya go and do that for?! That was our big star moment!\nRainbow Dash: Y-You were in danger! I saw the water! You were trapped!\nGoldie Delicious: Oh, pish-tosh! This is a magic show! We've seen it a thousand times! Everypony always escapes.\n[crowd murmuring]\nBig Bucks: Uh, that's right, folks! Because of our, um, skill as magicians!\nJack Pot: And now, a disappearing act!\n[poof!]\nAuntie Applesauce: Well, I hope you're happy! We've been waiting to be picked as the lovely assistants in that trick for years!\nGoldie Delicious: You keep ruinin' our fun! I had a hot hoof goin' in that game you decided to lose for us!\nGranny Smith: And I wanted to eat those nachos at the buffet!\nApple Rose: And I could have torn up the dance floor if you didn't keep stopping me!\nGranny Smith: They're bein' too polite to say it, so I will! Rainbow Dash, we thought you'd be a hoot, but I ain't never met a wetter hen!\nRainbow Dash: What?!\nGoldie Delicious: She's right! You've had your mane in a twist ever since we arrived!\nApple Rose: Is something the matter, dear?\nRainbow Dash: I'm so sorry, everypony. The truth is, all I wanted to do for this whole trip is ride the Wild Blue Yonder. I mean, it's why I came to Las Pegasus in the first place! Applejack told me not to let you out of my sight, or you might overdo it and we'd have to go home early.\nAuntie Applesauce: Applejack put you up to this?\nGrannies: [annoyed chattering]\nRainbow Dash: Well, now it's too late. I ruined your trip, and it's the last day ever to ride the Wild Blue Yonder! The line is so long, I'll never get to go on it.\nGrannies: [laughing]\nRainbow Dash: Hey, what's so funny?\nGranny Smith: [chuckling] Is that all you wanted?\nGoldie Delicious: Well, fish-flavored kitten kibble. Why didn't you say so sooner? Come on, girls!\n\n[trumpet fanfare]\nGranny Smith: We're Gold Horseshoe members. The most exclusive club in Las Pegasus. And she's with us.\nGoldie Delicious: We've been comin' here every moon since we can remember. Even some we don't remember.\nAuntie Applesauce: It definitely has its perks.\nRainbow Dash: Like fancy suites and rollercoaster rides?\nApple Rose: That's right. And I hope you like riding in the front.\nRainbow Dash: Um, yes! [squeals] This is amazing! Isn't this amazing?\nGranny Smith: Sugar, you probably want to hold on 'bout now.\n[coaster clanking]\n[cheering]\n[snap! snap! snap!]\n\nRainbow Dash: I'm sorry I misjudged you for being older ponies. You mares are actually pretty cool.\nGranny Smith: Rainbow Dash?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, Granny?\nGranny Smith: The gals and I have been talkin', and, well... We think you're a hoot after all! We'd like to invite you to become a permanent member of the Gold Horseshoe Gals! [hoots]\nRainbow Dash: Ha-ha! Really?\nGrannies: Mm-hmm.\nAuntie Applesauce: Same time next year?\nRainbow Dash: I wouldn't miss it for anything!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[doors open]\nScootaloo: Princess Twilight!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: We're glowing!\nTwilight Sparkle: [giggling] That's what happens when you're summoned by the Map.\nSweetie Belle: Somepony needs our help?\nApple Bloom: We're being called by the Map?\nScootaloo: Did I mention we're glowing?!\nTwilight Sparkle: [giggling]\nScootaloo: So where exactly in Equestria are we needed?\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, where you're going isn't even in Equestria.\nSweetie Belle: Wow! That's almost... off the table!\nApple Bloom: But what's way out there?\nTwilight Sparkle: Mount Aris, the home of the Hippogriffs! And that's where you're headed!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Whoa...!\n\n[theme song]\n\n[ponies chattering]\nSweetie Belle: You really don't need to come with us, Twilight. We can take care of this mission just fine on our own.\nApple Bloom: Mm-hmm.\nScootaloo: Yeah!\n[thud]\nScootaloo: Oof!\nSweetie Belle: Ugh!\nTwilight Sparkle: I know that. But I'm not so sure the ponies who care about you want you going off so far on your own. Besides, there's some school business I need to take care of on Mount Aris. This permission slip is for Silverstream. It's very important that her mother and father sign it, or else no field trips.\nScootaloo: [whispering, to Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle] Sounds like somepony just wants a vacation.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [giggling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, yes, I have been wanting to visit Mount Aris ever since the Hippogriffs moved back. But it's purely research. Silverstream's brother is gonna meet us there and take us to their houses.\nApple Bloom: Wow! They have more than one house?\nTwilight Sparkle: I guess so. The social structure of the Hippogriffs and seaponies is a bit of a mystery.\n\"All Aboard\": All aboard! Last stop \u2013 the new Mount Aris Station!\n[ponies chattering]\n[train whistle blows]\n[train chugging]\n\nSweetie Belle: I don't know if I'd like being a Hippogriff. Part bird, part pony...\nScootaloo: I'm happy with just my pony parts, thanks.\nApple Bloom: I think Hippogriffs are pretty neat. I learned all about them from Applejack. The Hippogriffs all once lived happily on Mount Aris. But when the Storm King invaded, they used a magic pearl to turn into seaponies and escape to the underwater safety of Seaquestria. Then, in the Battle of Canterlot, when Applejack defeated the Storm King\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait, what? She told you she defeated him? By herself?\nApple Bloom: Uh, maybe she didn't say that exactly. But it makes for a better story.\nTwilight Sparkle: [giggling]\n[train whistle blows]\n\"All Aboard\": Final stop \u2013 Mount Aris Station!\nScootaloo: [gasps]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Whoa!\n[train chugging]\n[brakes hissing]\nSweetie Belle: All right. So what kind of cutie mark-related friendship problem do you think we're supposed to solve.\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know. But Hippogriffs don't have cutie marks. So it might not have anything to do with that at all.\nApple Bloom: Huh. Still, the Map called us, so it must be a kind of problem that only we can solve.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Go, Crusaders!\nSweetie Belle: But how do we know exactly who we're supposed to help?\nScootaloo: Ahem. Attention, please! Anygriff here have a problem?\n[beat]\nScootaloo: Eh. That's all I got.\nApple Bloom: Maybe if the Map could be a little more specific about our mission, like maybe... an address?\nTwilight Sparkle: The Map doesn't really work like that. But I'm sure you and whoever needs help will find each other.\n\n[water splashing]\nTerramar: Excuse me! Miss Sparkle? Over here! Sorry I'm late. I'm Silverstream's brother Terramar.\nApple Bloom: A Hippogriff can have a seapony for a brother? How does that work exactly?\nSweetie Belle: Shhh! It's rude to ask a question like that!\n[magic sounds]\nScootaloo: Whoa!\nApple Bloom: Can I ask now?\nTerramar: [chuckles] It is kind of strange. See, after the Storm King was defeated, the seaponies didn't have to hide anymore. So some of them changed back to Hippogriffs and went home to Mount Aris.\nTwilight Sparkle: But others got used to living under the water and stayed in Seaquestria.\nTerramar: And me? Well, I kind of go back and forth with this. It's a tiny piece of the magic pearl. It was split up among our kingdoms.\n\n\n\n\nApple Bloom: Whoa!\n\n\nSweetie Belle and Scootaloo: Cool!\n\n\nApple Bloom: Whoa!\n\nSweetie Belle and Scootaloo: Cool!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, I'm pretty eager to see the Hippogriff village. You know, to... get this form signed. And... research! So...\nApple Bloom: Hey, Terramar? Does anygriff you know up there have a problem they need help with?\nTerramar: [chuckles] On Mount Aris? No. Everygriff is pretty happy up there. [sighs] It's a great place to live.\n\n[Hippogriffs laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Whoa! This looks amazing! Last time I was here, it was a ghost town!\nTerramar: Yeah. Queen Novo thought it was important to return our village to its former glory.\n[trumpet fanfare]\nSky Beak: And now, I officially open the \"Glad to Be a Hippogriff\" Festival!\n[trumpet fanfare]\n[Hippogriffs cheering]\n[whoosh!]\n[Hippogriffs cheering]\nTwilight Sparkle and Cutie Mark Crusaders: Ahh! Whoa!\n[Hippogriffs continue cheering]\nScootaloo: Wow! We picked a good day to show up!\nTerramar: Not really. We do this every weekend. Hippogriffs really like being Hippogriffs.\n[Hippogriffs cheering]\nSky Beak: [chuckles] There's my boy!\nTerramar: Hi, Dad!\nSky Beak: Haven't seen you in days, son. Wish you'd come around more often.\nTerramar: Oh! Dad, these are some of Silverstream's friends from Equestria. They came up to\u2014\nSky Beak: [gasps] Princess Twilight Sparkle! [screeches]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Aah!\nSky Beak: Attention, everygriff! Princess Twilight Sparkle is here! She's Silverstream's teacher!\n[Hippogriffs gaspinng and exclaiming]\nSky Beak: Here to take in the marvel that is Mount Aris, your Highness?\nTwilight Sparkle: Absolutely! And to have you sign a form for Silverstream.\nSky Beak: Glad to! But first, let's show the princess some real Mount Aris hospitality! To the refreshment tent for a stein of salmon juice!\nTwilight Sparkle: Eh. Research. See you later! And good luck! I know you'll find your mission!\nSweetie Belle: Well, your dad's certainly... outgoing, isn't he?\nTerramar: He's a great guy. All my relatives are nice. That's kind of the problem\u2014\nSweetie Belle: Wait, stop.\n[whimsical wind chimes]\nSweetie Belle: What's that wonderful sound?\nTerramar: Those are the Harmonizing Heights. Legend says that\u2014\n[zoom!]\n[whimsical wind chimes]\n[birds chirping]\n[water splashing]\nSweetie Belle: Woo-hoo! Yeah! Awesome! I love this!\nTerramar: Uh, is she okay?\nSweetie Belle: This is absolutely the best place ever! You are so lucky!\nScootaloo: And you get to swim in the ocean! You have two great places to live!\nApple Bloom: How do you make up your mind which one to stay in?\nTerramar: I can't. That's the problem.\nApple Bloom: Did you say... \"problem\"?\nSweetie Belle: You have a problem?!\nScootaloo: Yes!\n\nSweetie Belle: Woo-hoo! We discovered our mission!\nScootaloo: All right!\nApple Bloom: We did it!\nSweetie Belle: Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [chuckles nervously]\nScootaloo: Sorry. You were talking about your problem?\nTerramar: Right. Like I said, Mount Aris is one great place to live. That's why Silverstream and my dad and some of my cousins came back here. But Seaquestria is another great place to live. That's where my mom is.\nSweetie Belle: Ohhhh. I-I didn't know that.\nTerramar: So no matter where I am, I feel like I'm letting someone down.\nApple Bloom: No wonder you're having such a hard time deciding.\nTerramar: And I have to choose soon. Every other griff my age already knows where they belong. I'm still not sure.\nScootaloo: When in doubt, chart it out!\n\nScootaloo: Now, we put down everything great about each place and everything not so great. Compare them, and... your decision is made for you!\nSweetie Belle: Well, it's obvious, isn't it? Mount Aris is the best of all possible worlds. Pro \u2013 it's beautiful. Con \u2013 too far from Equestria. I think that pretty much sums it up.\nTerramar: But you haven't been to Seaquestria yet. How can you even compare them?\nApple Bloom: Terramar's right, Sweetie Belle. It'd be fair if we visited both places before we decide.\n[screech]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey, everypony! This festival is fantastic! Look what I won at the ring toss booth! Ahem. But of course, I'm really here on business. Sky Beak's already signed the form. Now I just need your mom's signature. Is she around?\nApple Bloom: Um... she's a seapony. In Seaquestria.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's what Silverstream meant by \"houses\"!\nTerramar: Mm-hmm. If you'd like to meet my mom, we're just heading down there now.\nApple Bloom: And how exactly are we gonna visit underwater?\n\n[magic sounds]\n[water bubbling]\nScootaloo: Whoa! [giggling] Woo-hoo! Yeah! [giggling] Whoa! This must be just like flying! Woo-hoo!\nApple Bloom: Where's your mom's house, Terramar?\nTerramar: Come on. It's this way.\nScootaloo: This is awesome!\n\nScootaloo: [giggling]\nTerramar: Mom!\nOcean Flow: Terramar! Welcome home, baby! No excuses. This time, you're staying for dinner.\nTerramar: [chuckles] Scootaloo, Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, this is my mom Ocean Flow. And this is\u2014\nOcean Flow: [gasps] Princess Twilight Sparkle! What an honor! You know, Silverstream just raves about you.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, she is one of our most hardworking students. In fact, I brought this form for you to sign so that\u2014\nOcean Flow: Both my children are so smart. Would you like to see their baby pictures?\nTerramar: Mom!\nTwilight Sparkle: That sounds adorable! I'd love to! And you know, to find out about aquatic pony early development and, uh...\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [giggling] Research.\nOcean Flow: Oh, well, maybe your friends would like a snack while we're gone? Some kelp chips? Fish oil tea?\nTerramar: No, thanks, Mom. I'm gonna go show them around.\n\nScootaloo: Look out! [giggling] Can't catch me!\nSweetie Belle: Huh. Not much sunlight down here, is there?\nScootaloo: [giggling]\n\n[bongo drums drumming]\nScootaloo: Boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom!\n\nSweetie Belle: No grass to run in and no hooves to run on it with. And excuse me, but how do you keep from getting all pruney? [sighs]\n\nScootaloo: [laughing]\n[thud]\nScootaloo: [bubbly] Everything sounds funny down here!\n\nSweetie Belle: Okay. I've seen everything I need to. So, uh, why don't we find Twilight Sparkle, finish the chart, and, uh, head back up the mountain? I have some serious field twirling to do.\nScootaloo: Where's she going? I want to stay and swim some more! [sighs]\n\n[magic sounds]\n[seagull squawking]\nSky Beak: [screeches] Princess Twilight, you're back! And just in time for the screeching competition.\nTwilight Sparkle: Why not? Could be another trophy in my future! Be back soon!\nScootaloo: All right! Let's add some positives to the Seaquestria side!\nApple Bloom: Uh-huh!\nScootaloo: Swimming is like flying, multi-color fish, and did I mention the flying thing?!\nSweetie Belle: You forgot the cons. Dark, wet, sea monsters...\nScootaloo: I don't remember any sea monsters. Apple Bloom, looks like it's up to you.\nApple Bloom: Me? Well... Both places have a lot of good things about them.

It's hopeless!\n\nThat's it! This is the end!\nDon't ever talk to me again!\n\nScootaloo: Hmph!\nApple Bloom: Sweetie Belle said to tell you it's your fault that Terramar ran off.\nScootaloo: Well, you tell Sweetie Belle that if it weren't for her, our mission would've been over by now! And a success!\nApple Bloom: [sighs] Scootaloo says this whole thing is your fault.\nSweetie Belle: Well, tell her that I'm not the one who dashed all of Terramar's hopes and made him give up on the world! Both worlds!\nApple Bloom: [sighs] Sweetie Belle says it's your fault that Terramar ran\u2014 Oh. Wait. I already told you that, didn't I?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, what's going on? Where's Terramar?\nApple Bloom: Uh, well... he... he kinda left. He wanted to be by himself.\nScootaloo: Which was not my fault!\nSweetie Belle: Mine, either!\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, of course not. Why would you think that?\nScootaloo and Sweetie Belle: Because it was our fault.\nScootaloo: All we had to do was help him choose which world to live in.\nSweetie Belle: And we let him down.\nTwilight Sparkle: Whoever said that he had to choose?\nApple Bloom: Well, he did.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmmm... Maybe Terramar's making it harder than it has to be.\nOcean Flow: Yoo-hoo! Princess! We're having a seashell-crafting circle. Care to join us?\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, we're right in the middle of\u2014\nSky Beak: There you are! The flag-folding ceremony's about to begin!\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you, really.

You're looking well.\n[Hippogriffs and seaponies chattering]\nSweetie Belle: Hmmm... This gives me an idea.\n\n[water flowing]\nScootaloo: Huh.

What did you have in mind?\nTwilight Sparkle: To commemorate your first sunrise, I've written a play. We'd like to perform it at my School of Friendship, if you don't mind.\nPrincess Celestia: [giggling happily] Mind? Oh! Of course not! Oh! I think a play is a fantastic idea!\nSpike: Did she just... prance?\nPrincess Celestia: Oh, uh, forgive me for getting so excited. It's just, when I was a filly, my friends often put on plays. [sighs] It was so wonderful. Everypony coming together to create a magical experience to share with others. I've always believed theater brings out the best in us and forges a special bond of friendship.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] I didn't know you used to act!\nPrincess Celestia: Oh, not me. I was always too busy with my magic lessons to be part of any plays myself. But still, it's something I always wished I could experience.\nTwilight Sparkle: And you still can! Princess Celestia, we would be honored if you would be the star of our play!\nSpike: We would?!\n\n[theme song]\n\nPrincess Celestia: You want me to star in your play?!\nSpike: Yeah... When did that happen, exactly?\nTwilight Sparkle: If you'll excuse us for a second... [whispering] Don't you see, Spike? It's perfect! Princess Celestia has always wanted to be in a play, and this one's about her!\nSpike: [whispering] I guess, but how are we supposed to give her directions? She's the ruler of Equestria!\nTwilight Sparkle: [whispering] She's also our friend. Celestia's always kind to everypony. So if we have a chance to finally do something for her, we should.\nSpike: Hmmm...\nTwilight Sparkle: [whispering] Come on. How many times has Celestia helped us? Guided us? Been a warm, calming voice over our shoulder?\nPrincess Celestia: Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle and Spike: Aah!\nTwilight Sparkle:\u00a0Yes, Princess Celestia?\nPrincess Celestia: Your invitation is very kind, but are you certain it's wise? I have no acting experience at all.\nTwilight Sparkle: Experience? Pssh! You'll be playing yourself. And we'll all help you. Please? It'd mean so much to the students if you were in our show.\nPrincess Celestia: Well, if you're sure...\nSpike: Yeah, what she said.\nPrincess Celestia: Then I would be delighted to join your theater troupe!\n\n[squeak]\nPinkie Pie: Woo-hoo!

Forget my regular party cannon! For princess-sized effects, we're gonna need Big Bertha!\nApplejack: Grrrr...! Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie: What?\nRainbow Dash: Our play is gonna be amazing! I gotta tell everypony I know! And even the ones I don't!\n[whoosh, boom!]\nApplejack: Why in tarnation are y'all gettin' so starstruck? We've met Princess Celestia before. Plenty of times.\nStarlight Glimmer: Those were formal things \u2013 galas, world-saving. This is different! Imagine doing sweaty warm-ups with a princess, blowing your nose in front of a princess, sitting around just... talking with a princess.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm a princess. You talk to me.\nStarlight Glimmer: That's different. You're not a \"princess\" princess.\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, thanks. Celestia wants to experience the special friendship that theater ponies have. To give her that, you just need to be yourselves.\nFluttershy: You... You really think so?\nApplejack: Heh. Aw, quit frettin'.

Action!\n[curtains squeaking]\nFluttershy: Once upon a time, before Celestia, Equestria was suffering terrible hardship. Raising the sun every morning was so hard, it took five great sorcerers plus Star Swirl the Bearded to do it.\nYoung Six: [straining]\n[clanking]\nFluttershy: And every day, the unicorns helping Star Swirl would use so much magic, they lost their powers forever. Things looked bleak. Soon, Equestria would lose all its magic users! Then, the land would be covered in darkness for eternity!\n[clanking]\nTwilight Sparkle: [to Spike] Even I can't believe how good my play is! The sets, the props, the outfits \u2013 they're all great!\nSpike: And... here comes the best part.\nFluttershy: But then, a student named Celestia discovered she had the power to raise the sun herself without draining her magic!\n[birds chirping]\nTwilight Sparkle: Um, that's your cue, Celestia.\nPrincess Celestia: Oh! Uh, right! Of course! Heh.

I think we have a problem!\nApplejack: [whispering] Yeah. Our lead actress is a disaster!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [hyperventilating] What are we gonna do?! If I tell Celestia she's terrible, it'll hurt her feelings, and I'll be a bad friend. But if I keep her in the show, she'll be the laughingstock of Equestria, and I'll be a worse friend.\nApplejack: Ya need to tell Celestia the truth, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: Any other suggestions?\nSpike: Why don't we just cancel the show?\nTwilight Sparkle: Real suggestions?\nSpike: No, think about it. Right now, most of Equestria doesn't even know we're doing a ones-versary play. If we shut it down...\nRarity: ...Nopony will ever miss it!\nStarlight Glimmer: So they'll never find out Princess Celestia's a bad actress!\nFluttershy: And she won't be embarrassed!\nPinkie Pie: Ah! It's the perfect plan!\nRainbow Dash: All right! I just finished telling everypony to come to our play!\nTwilight Sparkle: You... did?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! You should've seen how excited they got when they found out Celestia was in it! They said they'd tell their friends, and then their friends would tell their friends! Everypony in Equestria's gonna see this thing! Uh... did I miss something?\nTwilight Sparkle: Just the bright light of hope being snuffed. But that's okay. If we can't cancel the show, I know what I have to do.\nApplejack: Be honest with Celestia and give the lead role to somepony else?\nTwilight Sparkle: Not a chance!\nApplejack: Twilight, you know truth is a huge part of friendship.\nTwilight Sparkle: And so is making another pony's dreams come true. Look, I promised Celestia that this time, she could be a part of the play instead of just watching it. And I plan to keep that promise.\nFluttershy: But how?\n\nPrincess Celestia: You want to give me acting lessons?\nTwilight Sparkle: No-no-no-no-no-no-no. More like a special workshop with other actors. To... take your performance from good to flawless.\nPrincess Celestia: Thank you so much, Twilight! This is what I always knew theater must be about \u2013 that special stage pony bond of shared trust and honesty.\nSpike: Yeah. Heh. That's what it is. Ahem.\n[doors open]\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Celestia, meet Method Mare performers On Stage and Raspberry Beret!\nOn Stage: Avec pleasure, your Majesty!\nPrincess Celestia: The pleasure is all mine! If there's anything I can do to become a better Equestrian thespian, I will! What do you have planned?\nOn Stage: I thought we'd make it up as we go along. [chuckles] Otherwise known as improvisation!\nRaspberry Beret: Yes, and we can start as soon as we get out of this box.\nPrincess Celestia: What box?\nTwilight Sparkle: [distressed whimper]\n\n[clattering]\nTwilight Sparkle: How's it going over here?\nRainbow Dash: That sun will never rise again.\nPinkie Pie: That's why I have something even better!\n[zip!]\nRarity: [gasps] It's the perfect substitute!\n[pop!]\n[balloon deflating]\nRarity: It was the perfect substitute.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\n\n[teleportation zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: Please give me something to be happy about.\nOn Stage: Let's try visualization! And... you're skiing!\nRaspberry Beret: Whoosh! Whoosh! Oh, it's so snowy today! Brrr! I'm getting chilly!\nPrincess Celestia: Should I get you a blanket?\nOn Stage: All aboard! The Ponyville Express is leaving the station! Whoo-whoo! Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga...\nPrincess Celestia: It is? But I don't see anything.\nRaspberry Beret: Let's be weeping willows in the wind! We are strong in adversity yet supple as we bow to fate.\nOn Stage: Well? What do you feel?\nPrincess Celestia: Mmmm... nothing. Oh! The classroom floor under my hooves! Does that count?\n[clunk]\n\n[teleportation zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: Do I wanna know?\n[clanking]\nPinkie Pie: Wait for it...\n[flames crackling]\nApplejack: Pinkie Pie!\n[splash!]\nPinkie Pie: Whaaaat? It's realistic! The sun is just like a burning marshmallow!\n\n[water dripping]\n[whirring]\nTwilight Sparkle: What are they doing now?\nSpike: [sighs] The simplest acting exercise they could think of \u2013 a game of charades.\nRaspberry Beret: A puppy! A duck-billed platypus! Antidisestablishmentarianism! Oh, I give up! What?!\nPrincess Celestia: My love for Equestria and all the ponies in it! Twilight, you felt what I was emoting, didn't you?\nTwilight Sparkle: [stuttering] Yeah!\nSpike: [to On Stage] Now, that's the best acting we've seen all day.\n\n[indistinct chattering, orchestra tuning up]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay! I tried and tried and tried! But we have to face facts. We can't make Celestia an actress. So there's only one thing to do!\nApplejack: Tell her the truth finally?\nTwilight Sparkle: No!\nApplejack, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, Starlight Glimmer, and Fluttershy: [groans]\n[teleportation zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: I've rewritten the script to give Celestia a more artistic part with no lines.\nPinkie Pie: And to make sure the show's a hit, I've whipped up the biggest, bestest, flashiest fake sun ever!\nAll but Pinkie Pie: [gasps]\n[fuses sizzling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, Pinkie? That looks unsafe.\nPinkie Pie: Why would untested magic fireworks that I bought in a back alley from Trixie at midnight be unsafe?\n[fireworks exploding]\n[boom!]\nTwilight Sparkle: [coughing]\n[water splashing]\n[crash!]\nPinkie Pie: [blows]\nTwilight Sparkle: [anguished shriek] I can't take it anymore! It was supposed to be a simple play! Just one simple play! And then everything goes wrong, from the stage to the props, right down to the worst! Lead! Actress! In Equestria! [panting]\n[curtain flapping]\nAll but Twilight Sparkle: [gasps]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\n\nPrincess Celestia: Twilight, if you honestly thought I was a bad actress, why didn't you tell me?\nTwilight Sparkle: I-I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to insult your acting! It's just, I-I got so stressed! But... that's no excuse for what I said. You have every right to be upset with me.\nPrincess Celestia: I'm not upset because you insulted my acting.\nTwilight Sparkle: You're not?\nPrincess Celestia: I'm upset because, in all the time we've known each other, I thought I taught you about the importance of friendship, trust, and honesty!\nTwilight Sparkle: Celestia, wait!\nPinkie Pie: No!\n[thud]\nPinkie Pie: You can't fly away now! Look!\nFluttershy: Ponies are taking their seats for the show.\nRainbow Dash: [laughs] Standing room only! Did I do a good job of advertising for this thing or what? Sorry.\nStarlight Glimmer: We can't put on a show with no lead actress!\nApplejack: You go find Celestia. We'll figure out a way to stall this thing 'til you get back.\nSpike: Good luck. Nopony's gonna volunteer to try to tame that.\nRarity: No pony indeed.\nSpike: [gulps]\n\nSpike: So... [chuckles nervously] Ahem. Uh, who likes juggling?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Celestia! Please wait! Can we talk?\nPrincess Celestia: I'm afraid I haven't much to say, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: All right then. Just listen. You've guided me since I was a filly. You've given me knowledge and advice and friendship. Just once, I wanted to be able to give something back to you. I know what I did was wrong. I should've told you the truth. But I promised you could be in our play. I had to make it work. Nothing would make me feel worse than knowing I disappointed you.\nPrincess Celestia: You really mean that?\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course! I look up to you more than any pony I've ever met! I hate to let you down. Like I did.\nPrincess Celestia: [sighs] You had good intentions, Twilight. But you know that the truth is always better than a well-meant lie. Didn't Applejack remind you?\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] About a hundred times. And now, because I didn't listen to her, I've ruined your whole ones-versary.\nPrincess Celestia: Well... I don't know about that. Isn't there an old saying? \"The show must go on\"? There may be a way for us to save the play yet.\nTwilight Sparkle: But how? I mean, if I'm being completely honest... you're not an actress.\nPrincess Celestia: No. But I am a princess.\n\n[crowd booing]\nSpike: Ugh! Good news \u2013 free food. [chewing] Bad news \u2013 this play is officially a disaster.\nPrincess Celestia: Fortunately, I know a thing or two about how to deal with those.\nStarlight Glimmer: You came back!\nPrincess Celestia: Yes. But let's celebrate later. Right now, we have a show to do!\nRarity: But... but... but how?! The audience is about to riot! We have no backdrop! And our lead actress is\u2014!\n[squeak]\nRarity: Uhhhh...\nPrincess Celestia: No longer in that role. Rarity, Applejack, Pinkie, Twilight, go calm the audience. Let them know the play will start in just a minute.\n[teleportation zap]\nPrincess Celestia: Rainbow Dash, bring us some clouds and place them behind the stage. There, that's our new backdrop. Starlight, do you have a copy of the script?\n[magic zap]\nPrincess Celestia: Spike, you narrate the play. Fluttershy will be our new lead.\nFluttershy: Oh, my. Me? Playing you? While you watch me playing you? Oh, no. Oh, no. I think my stage fright is coming back. [hyperventilating]\nPrincess Celestia: Visualize with me. You're a princess. Regal. Commanding. Confident. Feel the rising sun's warmth. Equestria needs you.\n\nSpike: Once upon a time, before Celestia, Equestria was suffering terrible hardship. Raising the sun every morning was so hard that it took five great sorcerers plus Star Swirl the Bearded to do it.\n[crowd laughing]\n\"Rainbow Stars\": You call those great sorcerers?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, no! Hecklers! What should we do?\nPrincess Celestia: [whispering] Spike! Improvise!\nSpike: Y-Yes. And, uh... raising the sun each day was super draining. But you can see that for yourselves, right? I mean, do these guys look beat-up or what? Star Swirl's so stressed, he's got kinks in his horn!\n[crowd laughing]\nSpike: But that's okay. 'Cause it turns out Celestia had a special power to raise the sun all by herself!\nFluttershy: It's time for a new day in Equestria!\n[beat]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ah! In all the commotion, we forgot we don't have a sun! What do we do?!\nPrincess Celestia: We play charades.\n[crowd ooh-ing and ahh-ing]\n[crowd cheering]\nOn Stage: My goodness! I had no idea this production would have such elaborate special effects!\n\nPrincess Celestia: Judging by how many flowers the audience threw, it seems our play was a success.\nFluttershy: I just feel bad you never got a chance to actually be in it.\nPrincess Celestia: You shouldn't. I never felt I had to be on stage to be a part of the show. All I ever wanted was to share an honest bond of creativity, artistry, and happiness with my friends. And that's exactly what I got to do.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you for saving our play, Princess Celestia.\nPrincess Celestia: You're welcome, Twilight. But from now on, none of you will have to call me \"Princess\" anymore.\nTwilight Sparkle and Spike: Huh?\nSpike: Wait, what? We don't?\nPrincess Celestia: No. I had so much fun tonight, I've decided to give up my crown, step down from the throne, and devote all of my time to the theater!\nTwilight Sparkle: Y-You... what?!\nPrincess Celestia: Gotcha! Maybe I'm not such a bad actress after all.\nAll: [laughing]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[knocking on door]\nMail Pony: [sighs]\n[knocking on door]\n[pounding on door]\n[door opens]\nMail Pony: [clears throat] Morning, Sunburst.\nSunburst: What?

From Sire's Hollow.\nSunburst: Mm-hmm. Sure thing.\n[door closes]\nMail Pony: [groans]\n[thud]\n[shimmering sounds]\nSunburst: What's this? Could I be experiencing the cerebration transmogrification effect described in chapter seventeen\u2014?\n[thud]\nSunburst: Oh. My cutie mark is glowing. My cutie mark is glowing! I know what this means! Why am I yelling?!\n\n[theme song]\n\nSunburst: Princess Twilight, what an honor this is! I-I mean, it is, right? I'm called for a friendship mission?\nTwilight Sparkle: You sure are. And it must be a special one. Nopony outside of Ponyville has ever been called before.\nSpike: If you need some pointers, let me know. I've been on my fair share of missions.\nTwilight Sparkle: You've been on one, Spike.\nSpike: And that's my fair share.\n[door opens]\nSunburst: Starlight! You mean we've both been called? This is great!\nStarlight Glimmer: [depressed] Yeah... Great...\nSunburst: Aren't you excited? You and me on a mission together!\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans]\nSunburst: I'm... sorry. Are you not excited to go on a mission with me?\nStarlight Glimmer: No. Uh, no! I mean, yes. Heh. Totally excited about us going together. Just... not so excited about where.\nSunburst: Sire's Hollow?\nStarlight Glimmer: Yep. Home.\nSunburst: [deflated] Oh. Great.\nSpike: You know, I can go if you two don't want to. I am kind of an expert.\nTwilight Sparkle, Starlight Glimmer, and Sunburst: [groans]\n\n[train chugging]\n[indistinct conversations]\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] It's not that I don't want to go home. It's just that whenever I do, my dad treats me like a filly. Like nothing's changed since I was a foal.\nSunburst: Huh.\nStarlight Glimmer: I know. I'm a horrible daughter.\nSunburst: N-No, no! My mom actually does kind of the same thing.\nStarlight Glimmer: Really?\nSunburst: I don't even have to go home. She sends me letters constantly asking about my plans for the future. [imitating Stellar Flare] \"You're a grown-up pony, Sunburst! You need a plan!\" [sighs] I haven't been home in a while either.\nStarlight Glimmer: Hmph. We'll just have to explain to our parents that we're on an important friendship mission so they can't bother us.\nSunburst: Do you really think that will work?\nStarlight Glimmer: Nope!\n[brakes hissing]\n[train whistle]\n[train chugging]\nSunburst: [sniffs, sighs] The great thing about home is it always stays just how you le\u2014\n[thud]\nSunburst: Augh!\nStarlight Glimmer: Where did that come from?\n[gate creaking]\nAutomated voice: Welcome to Sire's Hollow!\n\"Ever Essence\": Essence?\nSunburst: Essence of what?\n\"Ever Essence\": You tell me.\n[spritz]\nSunburst: [coughing]\nStarlight Glimmer: What is it?\nSunburst: Uh... chocolate maybe?\n\"Ever Essence\": Not chocolate maybe. Chocolate definitely! And all of the benefits with none of the drawbacks.\nSunburst: Didn't this used to be a fruit stand?\n\"Ever Essence\": I don't know what it used to be. The Sire's Hollow Development Committee determined what it is.\nSunburst: The Sire's Hollow Development what? Where do ponies buy fruit?\n\"Ever Essence\": You can get a fruit smoothie two doors down.\nSunburst: All the shops are different. Everything's changed!\nStarlight Glimmer: Not everything. That's the same as it ever was.\n[door opens]\n\"Raspberry Latte\": Sorry. Our bookstore's been declared a site of historical significance by the Sire's Hollow Preservation Society.\n\"Minty Mocha\": You'll have to experience the books from here. That's why windows are see-through.\n[door slams]\nSunburst: What?!\nStarlight Glimmer: Preservation Society? What is happening around here?\nFirelight: I'll explain it to you, sugarplum! [chuckles] You are just as cutesy-wutesy as ever!\nStarlight Glimmer: [muffled] Dad! [normally] Quit it! What is going on?\nFirelight: Oh, just a father wanting to preserve our town's rich history for his little pumpky-wumpkin! [chuckles]\nStarlight Glimmer: Dad, you promised no \"pumpky-wumpkin\"'s in public!\nSunburst: [stifled laughter]\nFirelight: [whispering] Sorry, chipmunk cheeks.\n[smack!]\nStarlight Glimmer: Don't. You're preserving the whole town? That's crazy!\nStellar Flare: That's exactly what I told him! I said, \"Firelight, you're crazy!\"\nSunburst: Mom?\nStellar Flare: Our village needs the same thing you do, Sunburst \u2013 a clear plan for the future.\n[snip!]\nStellar Flare: That's why I started the Sire's Hollow Development Committee. And I've got plans for this little town. Big plans!\nFirelight: Listen here, Stellar Flare! I'm not gonna let you turn our historical heritage into Las Pegasus!\nStellar Flare: And I'm not gonna let you turn it into a museum!\nFirelight and Stellar Flare: [growling]\nStarlight Glimmer: W-Wait. Are you two fighting over this?\nSunburst: Like having a friendship problem?\nStellar Flare: Oh, there's no problem.\nFirelight: Because there is no friendship!\nSunburst: Well, the good news is we know why we're here.\nStarlight Glimmer: [huffs]\n\nSunburst: [sighs] Maybe we should've sent Spike after all.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs]\n[magic sounds]\nStarlight Glimmer: Sunburst and I were called here to do a job, and it looks like you two are it.\nStellar Flare: You mean your success depends on us?\nSunburst: Uh...\nFirelight: And you have to hang out with us the whole time you're here?!\nStarlight Glimmer: Um...\nStellar Flare: Well, I'll hear what you have to say. But every plan I've made for this town is perfectly reasonable.\nFirelight: Good luck convincing me my preservation efforts don't make sense.\nStarlight Glimmer and Sunburst: [sighs]\n\n[gate creaking]\nAutomated voice: Welcome to Sire's Hollow!\n\nStarlight Glimmer: So we can't hold the books?\n\"Raspberry Latte\": [laughing] No!\nSunburst: Can you hold the books?\n\"Minty Mocha\": No.\nStarlight Glimmer: So nopony can read the books?\nFirelight: [chuckles] Isn't she adorable?

But I call them essence!\n[spritz]\nSunburst: [coughing]\nStarlight Glimmer: [sniffs] Fruity.\nSunburst: Too bad there's nowhere to get actual fruit.\nStellar Flare: In the future, all ponies will drink their fruit!\nStarlight Glimmer and Sunburst: [slurping]\nStarlight Glimmer: [coughing]\n\n[thud]\n\"Cracked Wheat\": One hundred percent ancient pony grains! Just like the town founders ate!

I get it.\n\nFirelight: Maybe my preservation efforts were a little over the top.\n[crash!]\n\"Cracked Wheat\": [groans] Oh, no.\nStellar Flare: And I might have been trying to turn the town into a shopping mall.\nFirelight: Well, whatever direction the town takes from now on, how about we work together on it?\nStellar Flare: Deal! Sunburst, you should move closer to Ponyville. After this success, I'm sure the Princess of Friendship will want to send you on more missions.\n[smack!]\nSunburst: That's not really how it works. Oh, look at the time! We should get going now that we solved the friendship problem, right, Starlight?\nStarlight Glimmer: Yeah... The thing is, I don't think we did solve it. When we solve a friendship problem, our cutie marks are supposed to glow.\nFirelight: Aw, don't be disappointed, puddin'. Your papa will work this out for ya.\nStarlight Glimmer: Heh. My papa wasn't called by the map in Twilight's castle. I was.\nStellar Flare: How are you gonna explain this to the princess? What's your plan if she fires you from friendship quests?\nSunburst: Mom! She doesn't\u2014! It-It's not\u2014!\nStellar Flare: Use your words, Sunburst.\nSunburst: [angry groan]\nStarlight Glimmer: I guess you two weren't the problem we were sent to solve after all.\nStellar Flare: So now you don't even know why you're here? Ah! We have to figure this out before we run out of time!\nSunburst: [sighs] Mom, there isn't a time limit.\nFirelight: So you're here for an extra long visit? [laughs] You can stay in your old room, punkie wunk! It's just like you left it!\n[guitar riff]\nStarlight Glimmer: [whispering] We need to find this friendship problem now!\nFirelight: Now, I know you have your little job to do, but Stellar and I know the town a lot better than you two.\nStellar Flare: That's right! Neither of you have been home in ages. You're gonna need our help to succeed!\nStarlight Glimmer: I guess that makes sense...\nFirelight and Stellar Flare: [chuckling]\nStellar Flare: I already have some ideas!\nFirelight: Me, too!\nSunburst: I think I liked it better when they were fighting.\n\n[chalk tapping]\nFirelight: Okay! Now that I've explained how Sire's Hollow was founded, we can start to explore all the possible friendship problems that might have developed over time.\nStarlight Glimmer: [inhales] I appreciate the history lesson, Dad, but I need to find the problem now. In the present.\nFirelight: Aw, now, hon-bun. How are you gonna do that without all the backstory, huh? Oh! Of course I know how hard it is for you to sit still and focus, soooo... would it help you pay attention to hold on to your bwankie?\nStarlight Glimmer: [growling]\n\nStellar Flare: Now, you've had a little setback. But don't worry. I know exactly what you need to do.\nSunburst: Make a plan?\nStellar Flare: Already got one! Step one \u2013 interview the suspects. Step two \u2013 use your talents to solve the issue. Step three \u2013 get the Princess of Friendship to send you on more missions!\nSunburst: Mom! It does not work like that!\nStellar Flare: Uh-huh.\n[beat]\nStellar Flare: [clears throat]\n\"Ever Essence\": [poorly acted] Oh! Thank goodness you are here! These two ponies refuse to use my essences.\n\"Raspberry Latte\": Maybe because we don't like to cover our natural scent!\nStellar Flare: [clears throat irritably]\n\"Ever Essence\": Ugh.\n\"Raspberry Latte\": Ugh.\n\"Minty Mocha\": [sighs] [poorly acted] And she refuses to buy our books.\n\"Ever Essence\", \"Raspberry Latte\", and \"Minty Mocha\": [poorly acted] Surely this is a friendship problem.\nSunburst: Ugh! It needs to be a real friendship problem! You can't just make one up! [angry groan]\nStellar Flare: This is what happens when we don't rehearse! Ugh!\n\nFirelight: Starlight? Sweetie? I found a really old town bylaw that nopony agrees on. Apparently, we're not supposed to prance or canter after dinnertime. Could that be the problem? Silly-filly?\nStarlight Glimmer: Whew! What are you doing?\nSunburst: [sighs] Hiding from my mother. She started making up friendship problems for me to solve.\nStarlight Glimmer: [scoffs] My dad won't even let me talk to anypony in case they're \"strangers\". I'm a grown mare!\nSunburst: [sighs] We're never going to find the friendship problem with them around, let alone solve it.\n\"Cracked Wheat\": Maybe you two should start looking for it on your own? [crunching]\n\n[lamp clicks]\nStarlight Glimmer: [whispering] Okay! So we wanted to talk to all of you, you know, in private.\nSunburst: [whispering] Just to see if there were issues any of you had with your friends.\n\"Ever Essence\": [whispering] Got it. Just one question. Why are we whispering?\n\"Cracked Wheat\": They're avoiding their parents.\n\"Ever Essence\", \"Raspberry Latte\", and \"Minty Mocha\": Ohhhh... [various agreement]\nSunburst: No. Not avoiding. Just... taking a break.\nStarlight Glimmer: Yeah. We needed to focus. B-But we're definitely not avoiding them.\n\"Raspberry Latte\": So you're whispering with all of us in the darkest corner of the shop where nopony can possibly see because you're not avoiding them?\nStarlight Glimmer: Mm-hmm.\nSunburst: Uh, but they definitely can't hear us in here, right?\n\"Cracked Wheat\": No way! This is the antiquities section. Nopony ever comes back here.\nFirelight: There you are! But what are you doing in here? [gasps] Is the friendship problem in my favorite section of the bookstore?\nStarlight Glimmer and Sunburst: [groans]\n\nFirelight: ...And then, I thought the best way to look for a friendship problem in the present...\nStarlight Glimmer: Dad!\nFirelight: ...was to look back in our town history even farther!\nStarlight Glimmer: [angry groan]\nStellar Flare: Sunburst! Oh, finally! Now, I know you don't want me to make up a problem, but what if I start one?\nSunburst: That's not how this\u2014!\nStellar Flare: I mean, nopony ever became a success by following all the rules, right?\nSunburst: [nickers angrily]\nStellar Flare: [to Firelight] How are things on your end?\nFirelight: Couldn't be better! New leads and such!\nStarlight Glimmer: Guys...?\nStellar Flare: We really are providing excellent assistance, aren't we?\nSunburst: Guys!\nFirelight: I dare say our children should be grateful for our help.\nStarlight Glimmer: Guys!\nStarlight Glimmer and Sunburst: We don't want your help!\n\nStellar Flare: I'm sorry. You don't want our help?\nFirelight: [chuckles] That's... That's ridiculous! What reason could you possibly have for that?\nStarlight Glimmer: Because you're driving us crazy!\nStellar Flare: Oh, really? And just how am I driving you crazy?\nSunburst: By always coming up with plans! I don't need a plan! I mean, maybe I do, but it'll be mine, not yours!\nStellar Flare: [choking up] Well... I'm sorry for trying to help! [crying]\nStarlight Glimmer: And you're not any better! I'm not a filly! I'm a grown pony with a job to do, and I'll do it on my own!\nFirelight: Well. I'll let you get to it then.\nStarlight Glimmer: Great. Now we have to smooth things over with our parents on top of finding and solving a friendship problem.\nSunburst: It's almost like our relationship with our parents is the friendship problem.\nStarlight Glimmer: You don't think that's it, do you?\n\"Cracked Wheat\": [clears throat] That's what all of us think.\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans, collapses] Why couldn't we have been sent to stop a war or something?!\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Dad?\nFirelight: Hello, Ms. Glimmer. How is your friendship problem search going? I only ask as an interested observer, since I know you are an adult who's capable of doing things without help from anypony else. [whimpers]\nStarlight Glimmer: Actually... I think Sunburst and I figured out what it is.\nFirelight: So Stellar and I weren't really helpful after all.\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, we haven't actually solved it. And I don't think we can. Not without you.\n\nStellar Flare: [sniffs]\n[spritz]\nStellar Flare: [coughing] Pungent. Ugh. [to Sunburst] Oh. Did you come by to be driven crazy by more of your mother's plans?\nSunburst: No, I came to apologize.\nStellar Flare: Well, it's going to take more than an apology to make up for telling me you don't want my help finding your friendship problem.\nSunburst: Oh, I'm not sorry for that. Starlight and I already figured out what the problem is.\nStellar Flare: This is a terrible apology.\nSunburst: Well, if you come with me and help fix it, I'll give you a better one.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Usually, Twilight or one of our other friends gets called to a place with a friendship problem to fix.\nSunburst: But Starlight and I realized we came here to fix a friendship problem we already had.\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm sorry I've been avoiding coming home, Dad. But you can't keep treating me like a foal.\nFirelight: I'm sorry, sugarbun. [sighs] I just know how hard things were for you when you left home. I guess I wanted you to feel safe, like... when you were young.\nStarlight Glimmer: Dad, I know I've made some mistakes, and I'll probably make a bunch more. But I learn from them. I think that's what growing up is.\nSunburst: I'm sorry I never told you how much your plans bothered me, and I know you just want me to succeed. But I need to do that on my own.\nStellar Flare: I remember how lost you were when you flunked out of magic school.

And I definitely don't feel lost anymore.\n[shimmering sounds]\n\"Cracked Wheat\": [crying] That's so beautiful!\n\nStellar Flare: The glowing cutie mark is such a symbol of accomplishment. I don't suppose there's a way for you to get it to glow all the time.\nSunburst: [chuckles] Pretty sure it doesn't work that way.\nStarlight Glimmer: Not unless we solved a friendship problem every few seconds, and I kinda hope this one will be it for a while.\nFirelight: You know, it seems to me your map is saying we're not just your parents. Heh. We're your friends, too.\nStarlight Glimmer: I guess so.\nFirelight: So if I promise to treat you less like a little filly and more like a friend, will you visit more?\nStarlight Glimmer: Absolutely. Mmm.\nSunburst: And if you start to drive me crazy again, I'll tell you instead of never coming home.\nStellar Flare: That's lovely of you to say, dear. But you know, I can always visit you.\nFirelight: Stellar, you're a genius! [laughs] How do you feel about a road trip?\nStellar Flare: I might have a few plans for that.\nStarlight Glimmer and Sunburst: [chuckling nervously]\n[train chugging]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[whooshing]\n[papers fluttering]\nYona: Huh?\n[whooshing]\nSilverstream: Whoa!\nRainbow Dash: Did I miss the Teacher of the Month announcement?\nApplejack: You're just in time.

Fluttershy!\nApplejack: [groans] Again?\nRainbow Dash: Come on!\nFluttershy: Oh, my! I don't know how I keep winning.\n[camera flashes]\nRainbow Dash: Yeah. Me, neither.\nTwilight Sparkle: The award is based on the students' vote. They must really like you.\n[beat]\nTwilight Sparkle: Congratulations, Fluttershy!\nFluttershy: [giggles]\nTwilight Sparkle: Next item of business \u2013 I've been looking into a new activity for our friendship classes. Spike?\n[pages flapping]\nTwilight Sparkle: Section one-forty-seven, paragraph two states that teamwork is a key part of friendship. And section two-two-nine, paragraph nine says outdoor activity reinforces learning. Add that together, and what do you get?\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, ooh! Okay, let me see. One-forty-seven, two-twenty-nine, carry the two... Three hundred and eighty-seven?\nTwilight Sparkle: Mm-mm. A teamwork field trip. Leading it is a Teacher of the Month-type job, so I thought I'd ask\u2014\nApplejack: I'm your pony, Twilight! Sweet Apple Acres has taught me a thing or two about workin' together.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, but being a Wonderbolt's the definition of teamwork.\nApplejack: [chuckles] I'm sure you're not sayin' fancy flyin' makes ya a better choice than me.\nRainbow Dash: [chuckles] I wouldn't say \"better\". Just a little more qualified. No offense.\nFluttershy: Maybe you can lead the field trip together.\nApplejack: [stutters]\nRainbow Dash: [stutters]\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course! Who better to model the importance of working as a team?\nPinkie Pie: Um, Rarity? Fluttershy? Me? Spike? This flowerpot?\nTwilight Sparkle: Both of you are teamwork experts. If the students see the two of you teaching together, they'll learn even more. I know you've been competitive in the past, but I'm sure you'd never let that get in the way of friendship education.\nApplejack: Of course!\nRainbow Dash: Totally!\nApplejack and Rainbow Dash: [groans, chuckles]\n\n[theme song]\n\nOcellus: I've never been on a field trip before.\nSmolder: Yeah, what's the point of this exactly?\nGallus: Getting out of the classroom. Duh.\nYona: Yak best at field-tripping! [grunts]\nSilverstream: That's what we're doing?! So fun! [grunts]\nSandbar: [chuckles] Pretty sure the headmare has something else in mind.\nTwilight Sparkle: All right, class. Today you'll learn how important working together is for building a strong friendship.\nApplejack: Hey, y'all! Ready to get out there and do some learnin' the Apple family way?\nRainbow Dash: This is basically gonna be the best field trip in the history of ever! With me in charge, that is. Whoa!\nApplejack: [chuckles nervously] With us in charge. Meanin' mostly me.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah. Good one.\nTwilight Sparkle: And what teamwork activity do you two have planned for today?\n\n\n\n\nApplejack:\nShed buildin'!\n\n\nRainbow Dash:\nCanoe racing!\n\n\nApplejack:\nShed buildin'!\n\nRainbow Dash:\nCanoe racing!\n\nSilverstream: No... way. We get to do both?!\nTwilight Sparkle: I bet that's exactly what your teachers had in mind. Why don't you start with shed building first?\nApplejack: Heh. Don't mind if I do! Everycreature, follow the leader!\nTwilight Sparkle: I'll check in later to see how it's going. Remember to work together!\n\nApplejack: [deep inhale] Now take a good, deep breath. What do you smell?\nGallus: [inhale] Uh, yak?\nYona: [sniffing] Mm-hmm!\nApplejack: Nope. Try again.\nOcellus: Um, apples?\nApplejack: And...? Anyone? Anyone? No? The promise of... teamwork! That there's an apple shed. And this here is what we're gonna use to build it. Nothin' brings friends together like a little hard work and honest sweat.\nRainbow Dash: [laughing] Sweat? Seriously? That's supposed to be part of friendship?\nApplejack: Not everypony would know that, Rainbow Dash. Just \"Teacher of the Month\" kind o' ponies.\nRainbow Dash: Whatever. Let's just get this done so we can move on to my activity.\n\n[montage music]\n[hammering]\n[sawing]\nApplejack: That's it! Measure twice and cut once! Haste makes waste! Slow and steady!\nRainbow Dash: Emphasis on the slow.\n[whoosh]\n[thudding]\nRainbow Dash: [grunting]\nApplejack: Rainbow Dash! Ya can't build an apple shed like that!\nRainbow Dash: [scoffs] Oh, yeah? I just did!\n[thud]\nSandbar: Whoa! No way!\nRest of Young Six: Whoa!\nGallus: Impressive... if you can call an apple shed impressive.\nApplejack: Just 'cause it's fast don't mean it's good!\nRainbow Dash: Oh, sorry, can't hear you. Too busy practicing my \"Teacher of the Month\" pose. [grunting]\nApplejack: Don't count your pictures before they're snapped, Rainbow Dash.\nRainbow Dash: Oh, come on!

That means you gotta move fast! Any questions?\nYona: Uh, Yona has questions.\nRainbow Dash: No time for 'em! Get in the boat!\nApplejack: You really think winnin' some canoein' record is gonna get you that Teacher of the Month trophy?\nRainbow Dash: I'm pretty sure everycreature's gonna like it a lot better than pounding nails and cutting wood.\n[splashing]\nYona: Yak not like water.\nOcellus: Sometimes, when I'm scared to try something new, I whistle.\nYona: [weak whistling]\nGallus: We got you, Yona.\nYona: [yelping]\n[thud]\nApplejack: Way I see it, Twilight's gonna give that teachin' trophy to a teacher, not a racer.\nRainbow Dash: We'll see about that.\n\nRainbow Dash: Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Harder! Put your backs into it, newbies!\nApplejack: Stroooooke... Stroooooke... Stroooooke... Slower... Focus on your paddle technique, y'all.\nSilverstream: Woo-hoo! We're really going now!\nSmolder: So... when do we get to the part when we move?\n[water splashing]\nRainbow Dash: When everycreature starts listening to me, the leader of my activity, Applejack!

I can see the finish line from here!\nApplejack: If we go left, we'll be headin' straight into the bite-acuda fish!\nRainbow Dash: Who cares about a few fish?\nSandbar: Uh, professors?\nApplejack: You'll care plenty when they bite ya!\nSandbar: Guys?\nRainbow Dash: We'll just go around them!\nSandbar: Rock!\nAll: [screaming]\n[crash!]\n\n[water rushing]\nAll: [gasping, coughing]\nSilverstream: [giggling]\nYona: [panicked whistling] Oof!

Because there goes our new speed record!\nYona: [panicked whistling, coughing] Help! Yak not swim!\n[transformation zap]\nOcellus: That's okay! Your friends can change into creatures that do!\nYona: [panicked whistling, coughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: How's the canoeing... going?\nSmolder: About as good as the apple shed building.\nRainbow Dash: I totally had things under control until Applejack messed 'em up!\nApplejack: I did not!\nRainbow Dash: Did too!\nApplejack: Did not!\nGallus: Yup. It's been like this all day.\nSandbar: I wouldn't say all day. Just... ninety-nine percent of it.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't believe this! You're not teaching teamwork! You're competing with each other! I thought you were past that!\nRainbow Dash: We are! Mostly.\nApplejack: We got carried away with wantin' to be the Teacher of the Month is all.\nTwilight Sparkle: The Teacher of the Month wouldn't care about being the Teacher of the Month! I know Fluttershy would be thrilled to see another pony win. That's it! I'm taking over this field trip!\nApplejack: H-Hold up, Twilight. Don't count Rainbow Dash for the award just yet. You shoulda seen her fire up those students to build a shed.\nRainbow Dash: No way! You're the one the students listen to. Besides, you saved us from those pony-eating fish.\n[beat]\nRainbow Dash: Uh, long story. But Applejack should definitely be Teacher of the Month.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmmm... Maybe you two have learned something, after all.\nApplejack: Does that mean you'll give us another chance at the Teacher of the\u2014 [muffled]\nRainbow Dash: Field trip?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well...\nRainbow Dash: Come on, Twilight. We get it. No more arguing. Right, Applejack?\nApplejack: Right as rain and twice as fresh!\n[hoof-bump]\nTwilight Sparkle: Fine. But I'm picking the next activity you two lead. A nature walk. Nopony could possibly argue over that. Right?\nApplejack and Rainbow Dash: Right!\nApplejack: See? We're agreein' already.\n\nApplejack: Well, look at that. The path splits up ahead. Left or right?\nSmolder: Ugh. Here we go again.\nApplejack: Where to, Rainbow Dash?\nRainbow Dash: I was thinking right... unless you want to go left. Because what makes you happy makes me happy.\nApplejack: Aw, heck. Forget about me. You want to go right, we'll go right.\nRainbow Dash: But teamwork means listening to other ponies, so it's up to you.\nApplejack: Well, aren't you as sweet as sugar apple pie? But it's up to you.\nYona: Ugh! Follow me! Yak know best way!\nApplejack: Hey! Where are y'all goin'?\n\n[montage music]\n\nOcellus: I think we've gone in the same circle five times.\nSandbar: Only because someponies won't make up their minds about which way to go.\nRainbow Dash: Do you want to keep going in a circle, Applejack?\nApplejack: Up to you, Rainbow Dash. I insist.\nRainbow Dash: [chuckles] No, no. I insist.\nApplejack: Heh. But I insisted first.\nSilverstream: Are we still on a field trip? 'Cause this just feels like being lost.\nSmolder: Ugh.\n[whoosh]\nSmolder: We can still get back to school before dark if we cross that ravine and stop doubling back.\nRainbow Dash: We knew that. All part of our plan. Right, Applejack?\nApplejack: Uh, yup! All we have to do is, uh... build a bridge 'cross that, uh, giant canyon, and we're home free. That is, if-if you think a bridge is a good idea.\nRainbow Dash: Only if you want to build a bridge.\nGallus: Stop! Listen. We can just fly everyone over and be done.\nApplejack: Nope! There's still plenty o' time to teach y'all a lesson in teamwork.\nRainbow Dash: Cooperation!\nApplejack: Togetherness!\nRainbow Dash: You are so right!\nApplejack: Only as right as you are!\nSmolder: Okay! We'll build a bridge!

They're so\u2014 [yelping] ...easy to work with.\nYoung Six: [gasps]\n[wind whistling]\nApplejack: [muffled] Come on now...

And together!\n[vines snapping]\nSmolder: But mainly fast.\nApplejack: I hate to admit it, but\u2014\n[vines snapping]\nApplejack: ...this whole mess is kinda our fault.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah. No trophy is worth getting eaten over.\nApplejack: So what do ya say? You want to team up and get ourselves out of this here pickle barrel?\nRainbow Dash: I thought you'd never ask.\nRainbow Dash and Applejack: [screams]\nOcellus: Aah! Don't worry.

How was the field trip? What did you all learn?\nRainbow Dash and Applejack: Uhhhh...\nYona: Yak learn ponies smart!\nSilverstream: Yeah!

They showed us what not to do so we'd figure out what we should do.\nTwilight Sparkle: Really...?\nSandbar: It took us a while to get it.\nSmolder: Especially at the ravine. It would've been so much easier to just fly home.\nSilverstream: But instead, our professors built bridges the wrong way just to show us how important teamwork is.\nGallus: Yeah. That was super dangerous. Talk about commitment.\nOcellus: We know it's too early to pick the Teacher of the Month. But we'd like you to consider Rainbow Dash and Applejack.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you for telling me. I'm so glad to hear your field trip was a success. I'll make sure to schedule another one right away.\nYoung Six: [cheering]\nTwilight Sparkle: [to Rainbow Dash and Applejack] You were actually just competing the entire time, weren't you?\nApplejack: To tell you the truth... yeah.\nRainbow Dash: Well, not all the time. I agreed with you for the whole nature walk.\nApplejack: Only 'cause you were anglin' for that Teacher of the Month award!\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\nRainbow Dash: You were the one doing the \"angling\"!\nApplejack: [scoffs] You were more like fandanglin'!\n\n\n\n\nRainbow Dash:\nWhat does that even mean?!

Maybe Sugar Belle has a wacky cousin who's never been on his own, and she has to leave him in charge of her shop while she apprentices with Mrs. Cake, who does that, like, two days a week.

You're really going all out to cheer up Big Mac. I'm impressed.\nDiscord: Yes, yes, I'm amazing. Anyway, since we're in the neighborhood, care for a quick game of Ogres & Oubliettes? Like I've been wanting to play all week?!\nSpike: I take it back.\nDiscord: I'm helping our friend first and foremost. See for yourself.\nSpike: I think he's showing her a picture of Sugar Belle.\nDiscord: What?\nSpike: And now he's crying.\nDiscord: No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. No, he's not. Let me see that.\nSpike: Don't touch it! I'm looking!\nDiscord: Give me that!\nSpike: Cut it out! Discord, quit it!\n[poof!]\nBig McIntosh: She used to do this thing where her-her nose would wrinkle when she laughed. Right there, in that hole where your nose used to be. I never told her how much I loved wrinkle-nose cutie-face... [wailing] and now I never will!\nDiscord: Ugh. [snaps fingers]\n[poof!]\n\n[poof!]\n[thud]\nBig McIntosh: [crying]\nSpike: Okay. I think we've had enough of the aloof master of chaos remedies for a broken heart. You know what I do when I have a problem too big to solve? I hide from it! When she can't find you, she'll realize how much she misses you. Plus, if she can't find you, she can't break up with you.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup. Hup!\nSpike: Ha!\nDiscord: [snaps fingers]\n[poof!]\n[door opens]\nScootaloo: [sighs] I don't get it. We asked every stallion in Ponyville.\nApple Bloom: [groans] There's gotta be somepony we're missin'. Somepony obvious. Somepony right in front of our noses.\nSweetie Belle: Oh, well. At least the barn's looking great for Big Mac's date.\n[poof!]\nDiscord: Too bad there won't be a date.\nSweetie Belle: Sugar Belle is so lucky to have a non-secret admirer like Big Mac.\nDiscord: Well, she certainly doesn't seem to have appreciated it.\nApple Bloom: I bet she's gonna take one look at this barn and say, \"What did I ever do to deserve this?\"\nDiscord: [whispering] Yes, what did she do to deserve this?\nBig McIntosh: She broke my heart.\nDiscord: Well, not yet, technically. In fact, she can't break your heart if you break hers first.\nBig McIntosh: [angrily] Eeyup!\n\nSugar Belle: Thanks for the tour of Ponyville, Mrs. Cake.\nMrs. Cake: Oh, my pleasure.\nSugar Belle: I'm off to surprise Big Mac with the news. Imagine the look on his face when I tell him, \"We need to talk.\"\nMrs. Cake: Oh, dear me, no! I told you, don't say it that way or he'll think you're breaking up with him.\nSugar Belle: Break up with him? Never! Why, without my favorite delivery pony, I couldn't imagine being happy ever again. He knows that.\nMrs. Cake: Good! Save your mix-up for cake batter \u2013 that's what I always say! [chuckles]\nSugar Belle: He's a good listener, that pony. I promise you, no mix-ups.\n[poof!]\nSugar Belle: Ah! Big Mac!\nBig McIntosh: Sugar Belle... we need to talk.\n\nBig McIntosh: I know why you're here.\nSugar Belle: You do?\nBig McIntosh: But I have somethin' to tell you first.\nSugar Belle: Oh, can I go first? I'm gonna be\u2014\nBig McIntosh: Stop.\nSugar Belle: Oh. Why don't we tell each other on three? One\u2014\nBig McIntosh: It's over!\nSugar Belle: What's over?\nBig McIntosh: You and me. It's over.\nSugar Belle: Ah... What?\nBig McIntosh: We're breakin' up!\nSugar Belle: I... don't understand. Why are you breaking up with me? And why are you leaning like that?\nBig McIntosh: I... don't know!\nSugar Belle: Big Mac, please. Talk to me.\nBig McIntosh: I... You... [loud groan] This is why I don't like talkin'! Words can hurt! Words hurt! Goodbye, Sugar Belle!\n[door slams]\nSugar Belle: [crying]\n\n[sad montage music]\n\n[door opens]\nApple Bloom: Big Mac! Oh, thank goodness! You gotta help us with this.\n[rustling]\nSpike: Ugh. Dude, how long have you been not hiding?\n[poof!]\nDiscord: Oh. I should probably have said something.\nBig McIntosh: Y'all should go.\nSpike: Did ya...? Did she...? Are ya...?\nApple Bloom: Big Mac, what's goin' on? Where's Sugar Belle?\nBig McIntosh: Just go!\nSweetie Belle: But we worked so hard on this chart. I think we've almost cracked it. If you could just\u2014\nBig McIntosh: Not right now!\nSweetie Belle: But I can't stand having a secret admirer who's too scared to tell me who he is!\nBig McIntosh: Maybe he doesn't like talkin'!\nSweetie Belle: But that doesn't make any sense!\nBig McIntosh: Maybe he used to talk too much, and it only ever got him into trouble!\nSpike: [sighs] What if you're right, Discord? What if love isn't real at all?\n[ding!]\n[poof!]\nBig McIntosh: I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle. I'm just mad, and I'm takin' it out on you.\nSweetie Belle: That's okay. I bet it felt good to get it out though.\nBig McIntosh: Actually, it did. Tellin' you how I felt just then... I gotta go!\nSpike: Big Mac! Where are ya goin'?\nBig McIntosh: I gotta talk to Sugar Belle!\nSpike: Discord, you gotta use your magic and...! Guess you have better things to do. Big Mac's gonna need a miracle.\n\nSugar Belle: [sighs]\n[clatter]\nSugar Belle: Oh. All the rotten luck...\n[splash]\nBig McIntosh: Caught ya just in time! We both know I don't like to say much, but I'm gonna say somethin' now. [sighs] Even though I'm hurtin', I wouldn't trade this feelin' for anythin'. Because it'd mean givin' up the good times we had, too. I only broke up with you because you were gonna break up with me. I respect your decision, and you should know you'll always be in my heart.\nSugar Belle: I didn't want to break up with you.\nBig McIntosh: But... you said you didn't need me to visit anymore. You said I'm gonna be on my own. I-I heard you said \"we're finished\" when I was hidin' in the bushes.\n[beat]\nBig McIntosh: That sounds worse than it is.\nSugar Belle: Oh, Big Mac! I was talking about my cousin! I have this wacky cousin who's never been on his own, but I have to let him run my shop on weekends. Which is why you won't be delivering to my village anymore because I'll already be here apprenticing with Mrs. Cake, who does that two days a week. No, three.\nBig McIntosh: Wait 'til I tell Spike!\nSugar Belle: I'd never break up with you! I suppose there's a lesson here somewhere about communication, talking instead of assuming, or eavesdropping is wrong. Wouldn't you say?\nBig McIntosh: Eeeeyup!\nSugar Belle: [giggles, snorts]\nBig McIntosh: Hee-hee. Wrinkle-nose cutie-face. [kisses] You must've been awful confused at my breakin' up with you after you got my pie.\nSugar Belle: What pie?\nBig McIntosh: You didn't get the pie I sent?\nSugar Belle: Mm-mm.\nBig McIntosh: Or the invitation?\nSugar Belle: Uh-uh.\nBig McIntosh: Well, in that case... allow me to escort you to a Hearts and Hooves Day surprise!\nSugar Belle: [giggles, snorts]\n\n[birds chirping]\nSweetie Belle: [sighs]\nApple Bloom: Mind if we join ya?\nSweetie Belle: [chomp] [reading] \"Happy Hearts and Hooves Day, Sugar Belle. Meet me\u2014\"\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Sugar Belle?!\nScootaloo: You have got to be pulling our hooves!\nSweetie Belle: It was all a mix-up?!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [laughing]\nSweetie Belle: Oh, it's funny. I've been sitting here feeling sorry for myself for not having a special pony on Hearts and Hooves Day. But remembering all the fun we had, I think I have two special ponies \u2013 my two best friends.\nApple Bloom and Scootaloo: Awwwww...\n\nSpike: [sighs] And so ends another Hearts and Hooves Day. Despite a bumpy start... and middle... and ending... lot of bumps today... love was in the air.\nDiscord: So was confusion, apparently, and a fair number of assumptions.\nSpike: But you have to admit, after seeing everything Big Mac went through, love is a hundred percent real.\nDiscord: [humming]\nSpike: Seriously?! Discord, come on! I can't believe you!\nDiscord: Who do you think broke Sugar Belle's wagon wheel?\n[thud]\nDiscord: Ta-da! Happy Hearts and Hooves Day!\nSpike: You old softie. [laughs] I knew you had a heart.\nDiscord: Speaking of how great I am, are you busy for the rest of the night? [snaps fingers]\n[poof!]\nDiscord: Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility isn't going to reclaim itself, you know.\nSpike: Ogres & Oubliettes? I thought you'd never ask! Oh, and... just wondering. No biggie, but... is Skellinore gonna be there?\nDiscord: Spike, she's an imaginary one-dimensional paper cutout skeleton.\nSpike: Well, nopony's perfect.\nDiscord: [snaps fingers]\n[poof!]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nRarity: I do appreciate you showing me the way to the phoenix nests, Spike.\nSpike: Anything for you, Rarity. Besides, I've been meaning to visit Peewee.\nRarity: He really was an excellent pet. I can't imagine why you set him free.\nSpike: Phoenixes aren't meant to be domesticated. Even in the wild, they like to keep to themselves.\nRarity: Well, they are beautiful. A few of their feathers will add just the right splash of color to my latest\u2014 Spike! What are you doing?\nSpike: Uh, nothing!\nRarity: Is there something wrong with your face?\nSpike: [sighs] It's a stone scale. It isn't magical or anything like the call of the Dragon Lord. It's just... red. And itchy. [groans] And embarrassing.\n[throbbing]\nRarity: Ooh, precious pants, that does look uncomfortable. But even I get the odd blemish from time to time. It's nothing to be embarrassed by. You could pay Zecora a visit. She makes a cream that works wonders. Just don't get the shampoo.\nSpike: There's Peewee's parents! But I don't see Peewee.\nRarity: Oh, maybe he moved out. Everypony has to leave the nest at some point.\n[fluttering]\nSpike: Peewee!\nPeewee: [squawks]\n[sizzle]\nSpike: Ouch!

[continues snoring]\nTwilight Sparkle: It's nearly noon, and you promised to help me with my lecture for class today!\nSpike: Noon? Whoa! I slept like a rock! Which reminds me \u2013 all that sleep probably cleared up my stone scale!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Um, on second thought...

It's not the end of the world.\nSpike: That's easy for you to say. Your face isn't covered in itchy red spots! [scratching]\nTwilight Sparkle: I used to get terrible breakouts any time I had a final exam with Celestia. Who probably never had a blemish her whole life.\nSpike: Well, I'm not in magic school.\nTwilight Sparkle: No, but these things can be stress-related. And you did spend yesterday with Rarity.\nSpike: [chuckles nervously] What could possibly be stressful about that?\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans] You could try Zecora.

[muttering lowly]\nRarity: Sorry, you'll have to speak up. My ears are a little bit clogged or something. It's just that I absolutely must have a model for my phoenix feather dress, and nopony else is available.\nSpike: Sorry, Rarity, but I... I am super busy all day giving... tours of the school!\nPinkie Pie: Really? I thought I was giving tours today. Guess not. Free day! Whee! Woo-hoo!\n\nSpike: Classrooms are that way. [groans] Dorms are that way. [groans] Twilight's office is up there. This is a fountain.\nTourist Pony: [panting] Could you slow down a bit? We've come a long way to see the school, and I don't wanna miss anything.\nSpike: Oh. Um, yeah. [wincing, scratching] Sorry.\nTourist Pony: I-Is something wrong?\nSpike: What? Why? No!

[loudly, echoing] I don't know! [gasps]\n\nSpike: [echoing] This is the school library! It's one of the most serene spots on campus, where students can spend time in quiet reflection or study! What?!\nSmolder: Could you please stop shouting? We're trying to do our homework, and it's kind of distracting.\nSpike: [loud voice] Was I shouting?!\n[affirmative muttering]\nSpike: [clears throat, normal volume] I have no idea what you're talking\u2014 Ulp! [belches, breathes fire]\n[thud]\nSpike: [gasps and groans]\n\nSpike: [breathing fire]\n[door opens]\nSmolder: If you're trying to hide, you need to do a better job. All I had to do was follow the smoke.\n[door closes]\nSpike: [low voice, straining] Leave me alone!\nSmolder: What?\nSpike: [low voice, straining] Leave! Me! Alone!\nSmolder: I can't under... Was that \"sleeves made of foam\"?\nSpike: [low voice] I said, leave [normal voice] me alone! [belches, breathes fire, sighs]\nSmolder: [laughs] Wow! I have seen some pretty bad molts in my time, but yours takes the cake!\nSpike: Molts?\nSmolder: The molt? Super painful stone scales, fire burps, uncontrollable volume shifts? It's all part of growing up dragon. Congrats!\n[smack!]\nSpike: [groans and winces]\nSmolder: Oh. Sorry.\n\nSpike: No-no-no-no-no. The last time I grew up, I turned into a giant greedy monster.\nSmolder: Greed-induced bigness. That's totally different. The molt is completely normal. Every dragon goes through it. Pretty soon, you'll leave and strike out on your own.\nSpike: Why would I do that?\nSmolder: Have you been living with ponies your whole life?\nSpike: Uh-huh.\nSmolder: Oh. Well, in the Dragon Lands, a molter's loved ones kicks them out at the first stone scale.\nSpike: What? Why?\nSmolder: I think it's biological. We call it the \"molt effect\". I haven't even told you about the smell.\nSpike: Smell? [sniffs] Ugh!\nSmolder: Yeah. I mean, I love my brother and all, but one whiff, and I was all \"See ya!\" [sniffs] Speaking of which...\nSpike: Wait! Does the molt effect happen to ponies too? [gasps] Twilight already asked me to leave the castle today. If she kicks me out, where am I gonna live? I'm too young to grow up!\nSmolder: I'm sure you'll find a nice...\n[thud]\nSmolder: ...hoard of gems to guard or a village to terrorize. Oh, now that dragons and ponies are friends, I guess that's off the table.\nSpike: So no creature's gonna wanna be around me?\nSmolder: Oh, I didn't say that. That molt stench is a magnet for predators. Tatzlwurms, hydras, rocs...\nSpike: Dragons are scared of rocks?\nSmolder: R-O-C-S. Rocs? Humongous birds of prey that can snack on a molting dragon like candy!\nSpike: [low voice] So Twilight's kicking me out, and the only creatures who don't find me disgusting want to eat me?\nSmolder: Seriously, I heard none of that.\nSpike: [loud voice] Twilight's kicking me out, and the only creatures who don't find me disgusting want to eat me?!\nSmolder: Congrats!\n[door opens]\nPinkie Pie: [shouting] Hey! Is this the shouting closet?! Because I've got a free day, and I'm totally up for some shouting! [sniffs] [normal voice] Also, where's that brussel-sprouts-covered-in-cotton-candy smell coming from? Because it is really interesting.\n\nSpike: I didn't know where else to go. I can't take the chance that Twilight will kick me out. You aren't feeling any molt effects, are you?\nZecora: [nose plugged] When it comes to breakouts, I've seen all circumstances. But as with the molt smell... let's not take any chances.\nSpike: [scratches, sighs] Is there anything you can do to cure me?\nZecora: The ailments you have aren't something to cure. The molt's a condition that dragons endure.\nSpike: [scratches] But if anypony sees or smells me right now, they'll be so grossed out, they'll avoid me forever!\nZecora: Perhaps we can lessen this strange molt effect. The smell is the most likely cause, I suspect.\nSpike: [low voice] It's all so embarrassing.\nZecora: I know you are speaking, but I can't hear a thing. Are you talking about teaching asparagus to sing?\nSpike: [low voice] I said it's [loud voice] embarrassing!\nZecora: If the goal is to not have your friends all depart, perhaps your volume is where we should start.\n[stomach rumbling]\nSpike: Oh, no. [gags, belches, breathes fire, sighs]\nRarity: Zecora! Hello? Are you there?\nSpike: [loud voice] I can't let Rarity see me like this! Please don't let her know I'm here!\n[knocking on door]\n[door opens]\nRarity: [loudly] Oh, dear! I'm talking even louder than I thought, aren't I?!\nZecora: I have volume concerns today by the scores. But it seems that I'm ready to help you with yours.\nRarity: [loudly] Eh, I-I'm sorry?! I can't seem to hear anything! I was hoping you could help! I have no idea what happened! One minute, I was sewing phoenix feathers onto a dress, and the next I couldn't hear my own voice!\nZecora: Ah, the feathers of that bird can affect ponies' ears. It's a magic ailment I've treated for years.\nRarity: [loudly] I only know you're talking 'cause your mouth is going up and down. [sighs, sniffs, coughs] [normal volume] Oh, goodness! I hope that incredibly pungent odor belongs to some sort of magical curative. [loudly] I hope you're not busy, but I must have my hearing back! It turns out that I talk to myself while I sew, and without that conversation, I simply can't think!\nZecora: It's a simple cure, and the directions are clear. Just one or two drops in each of your ears.\nRarity: [sighs, normal volume] Oh, thank you. You're an ear saver. [loudly] Oh, and while I am here, do you have any blemish cream?! Spike is having some scale issues!\nSpike: [loud voice] You have no idea!\nRarity: [gasps, normal voice] I think I heard something! [loudly] Your cure is working already!\nZecora: The cream that you want is just over here. It's a popular potion for all creatures this year.\nRarity: [sighs, normal voice] Thank you, Zecora.\n[window creaks]\n[door opens]\nRarity: [loudly] I don't mean to be rude, but I do think your hut could use an airing out!\nZecora: Rarity's gone. There's no need to hide. [sniffs, groans] Though I wonder if we should continue outside. Can't treat your symptoms down there on the ground. It's safe to come out. There's no ponies around.\nSpike: I'm not hiding from ponies. I'm hiding from that!\n[roc screeches]\n\n[roc screeches]\nSpike: Did I forget to mention the molt smell attracts predators?\nZecora: That's something that would've been quite nice to know! But it's not worth discussing right now! We should go!\n[roc screeching]\nSpike: It's only after me! I'll lead it away while you get help! This way, birdy-bird! Molting dragon over here! [grunting and huffing]\n[leaves rustling]\nSpike: Okay, maybe this wasn't a good plan.\nZecora: You can't hide in a tree! You have to come down! We stand a much better chance on the ground! [screams]\nSpike: Zecora! Bring her back! [groans, scratches]\n[roc screeches]\nSpike: [panting]\n[thud]\nRarity: Oh, Spike. What are you doing here?\nSpike: Rarity! You have to get out of here! There's a giant roc trying to eat me! It's got Zecora!\nRarity: Yes, what? [loudly] I was just at Zecora's, but I'm heading back! I can't read these instructions! Does this say \"two drops once a day\" or \"one drop twice a day\"?!\nSpike: Rarity, there's no time! We have to get help!\nRarity: [loudly] Yes, my ears are completely clogged! Why, Spike! Your stone scales look worse! Oh, here! I picked up just the thing. Ah\u2014\n[roc screeches]\nRarity: [screams]\nZecora: Oh, I wish you'd escaped either claw of this bird! But the both of us trapped in the same one's absurd!\nRarity: [loudly] What?!\nSpike: [groans] Let my ponies go!\n[thudding]\nSpike: Whoa! [breathes fire]\n[roc screeches]\nSpike: [screams, groaning]\n[grinding sounds]\nSpike: [sighs, scratches, wailing groans]\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, what are you doing?\nSpike: If my stone scales didn't itch so much and we weren't in immediate danger, this would be [chuckles] really embarrassing!\nTwilight Sparkle: Danger?\n[roc screeching]\n[teleportation zaps]\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, I was headed to Zecora's to get some cream for your scales. I had no idea you were\u2014\nSpike: [groans] About to be eaten by a giant predator attracted to my molt smell?! [scratches]\nTwilight Sparkle: Molt smell?\n[roc screeches]\nRarity: [high-pitched] Twilight!\nSpike: Whoa!\nTwilight Sparkle: Was that Rarity?\nSpike: And Zecora! I tried to save them, but it's all I can do to stop scratching long enough to dive out of the way when that bird attacks!\n[magic zaps]\nRarity: [loudly] This isn't the first time I've been in the clutches of a horrible giant creature, but it doesn't get any easier! [cries]\n[magic zaps]\nSpike: [gasps, sighs] Finally! I didn't think that itching would ever stop!\n[cracking sounds]\nSpike: What's happening?! I... I can't move!\n[magic zaps]\n[cracking sounds]\nSpike: What just... happened? Did I just sprout wings? I just sprouted wings!\n[magic zaps]\n[roc screeches]\nSpike: [gasps] I've gotta help them! W-Whoa! Whooaaa! [yelping]\n[thuds]\n[magic zaps]\nSpike: Whoops.\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike?! How did you get wings?!\nSpike: I don't know! But they're pretty aweso\u2013 Whoa!\n[roc screeches]\nTwilight Sparkle: Do you think you can fly up and distract him while I work on freeing Zecora and Rarity?\nSpike: Hey, giant chicken! If you like dragons so much, come and get me!\n[beak snapping]\nSpike: Greetings.\n[beak snaps]\n[stomach rumbling]\nSpike: [breathes fire]\nRarity: [screams]\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike!\nZecora: I know that the molt produced surprising things. But I'm glad that the last was a new pair of wings!\nRarity: [loudly] Yes! And also, I'm glad you've got wings!\nTwilight Sparkle: This is amazing! I didn't know if you'd ever get wings. I'm so happy for you. Does it have something to do with this molt you were talking about?\nSpike: [sighs] It's what's been going on with me. The breakout, the fire burps. The molt is when dragons get older and start to change. I wish I could stop it, but I can't. I-I should go.\nTwilight Sparkle: Go? What are you talking about?\nSpike: In the Dragon Lands, families make molters leave home. It's called the molt effect.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, this isn't the Dragon Lands, and molt effect or no, I don't want you going anywhere.\nSpike: But I'm growing up. What if something even worse happens?\nTwilight Sparkle: You're supposed to grow up, but you'll always be you. And whatever happens, we'll get through it together.\nSpike: Woo-hoo! Yeah! Woo-hoo! Look at me! Let's go home!\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, I don't need to carry you anymore, do I? You have wings.\nSpike: They are new, and I don't want to overdo it.\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\n\nRarity: I can't believe you thought any of us would send you away because of some silly molt effect. [sighs] Even if the symptoms were slightly unsettling. And let's face it, the odor wasn't pleasant. Nopony would stop caring for you just because you were getting older. Everypony goes through changes, but sometimes change can be wonderful. Like being able to model for any length of dress! [giggles] Uh, a bit higher, darling, please?\nSpike: I'm glad to help, Rarity. But don't you think there's wonderful things about flying that don't involve dresses?\nRarity: Of course, darling. Flying will also be beneficial for you to help me with gowns, frocks, robes, shifts, skirts, minis, maxis...

Today, we're going to learn about friendship through the ages. Spike, slide one, please.\n[slide projector turns on]\nTwilight Sparkle: Back in the days of Chancellor Puddinghead... Uh, Spike?\nSpike: Huh? Sorry, Twilight. Still getting used to my new wings. They're pretty great, huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, Spike. As I was saying... Huh? What are you three doing here?\nApple Bloom: We wanna go to your school!\nTwilight Sparkle: But why?\nSweetie Belle: We wanna learn friendship!\nScootaloo: And play buckball!\nTwilight Sparkle: I see. Why don't you three come with me? Spike, you're in charge.\nSpike: Yes!\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Hi, Twilight! Looks like you could use a guidance counselor's help! Hint, hint.\nTwilight Sparkle: No, thanks, Starlight. I've got this.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sadly] Great. Well, I'll just... go dust my office for the seventieth time.\nTwilight Sparkle: [to Cutie Mark Crusaders] I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but... you can't be my students.\nSweetie Belle: Why not?\nScootaloo: Isn't this place for everycreature?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, but we teach friendship lessons here. You already know all about helping ponies in need and being there for each other.\nSweetie Belle: Can't you just give us a chance?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Pleeeeeeeeeeeaaaase?\nTwilight Sparkle: You need Cheerilee's classes, not mine. Hurry up. You don't want late marks on your permanent record.\n[door opens]\nStudents: O dragon! My dragon!\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike?! What did you do?\nSpike: [laughs nervously]\n[door closes]\n\nScootaloo: [sighs] Well, I'm not giving up! I know we can prove we belong in this school!\nSweetie Belle: Yeah! Um... how?\nApple Bloom: By showin' Twilight we've still got lots to learn about friendship. And I know just where to start.\n\n[squish]\nApplejack: [grunts] What in tarnation? Apple Bloom! You know better than to leave our good tools out like that! And aren't you supposed to be on harvest duty right now?\nApple Bloom: Eh, it's not like the apples are goin' anywhere.\nApplejack: [stammering] What's gotten into you? Those chores are your responsibility! Farm work is family work!\nApple Bloom: Sorry, Applejack. Maybe if I went to Twilight's school, I'd learn to be better at helpin' the family.\nApplejack: Ahhh. So that's what this is all about. Well, if it's learnin' you want, I'd be happy to give you a private lesson right now... [angrily] Startin' with cleanin' up all this equipment!\nApple Bloom: Hmph!\n\nSweetie Belle: Please can I go to Twilight's school?!\nRarity: [screams, sighs, sighs again]\nSweetie Belle: Please? Please?!\nRarity: I'm going to call you \"Repeatie Belle\"! We've been through this! Please let me concentrate! [sighs]\nSweetie Belle: How 'bout now?\n\nRainbow Dash: So there I was, leading the Wonderbolt formation into a super dangerous Sundown Spiral, when suddenly... [imitates whooshing] There was a huge storm cloud in our way!\n\"Citrine Spark\": What happened?\nRainbow Dash: My genius happened! I changed the routine on the fly! And because my crew are such tight friends, they followed me!\n\"Berry Bliss\": [gasps] What did you do?!\nRainbow Dash: Only the coolest thing ever! I flew up and\u2014\nScootaloo: Did a super-amazing half-twist into a backflip sonic rainboom?!\nRainbow Dash: Hey! I never told that story to my students before. Scootaloo!\nScootaloo: [laughs nervously] Never met her. [sighs]\n\n[ponies chattering]\nSweetie Belle: They're coming! Get ready!\n[scooting]\n[whirrs]\nScootaloo: Look out!\nApple Bloom: [stiltedly] Look out! Whoa!\nScootaloo: [grunts]\n[thudding]\nScootaloo: [stiltedly] Hey! Watch where you are going!\nApple Bloom: [stiltedly] I was watching! Watching you drive like a crazy pony!\nScootaloo: [stiltedly] Well, maybe if you did not drop apples all over the street, I would not have to!\nFluttershy: Ooh. I've never seen Apple Bloom and Scootaloo argue like this.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah. They usually go together like candy canes and stripes.\nSweetie Belle: Whoa! Oof!\nApple Bloom: [stiltedly] My apples? This is all your fault, Scootaloo!\nScootaloo: [stiltedly] Hey, Sweetie Belle is the clumsy one!\nSweetie Belle: [stiltedly] I'm not talking to either one of you ever again!\nFluttershy: Goodness. They seem really upset.\nPinkie Pie: It's almost like they forgot they're friends.\nScootaloo: [quietly] I think it's working!\nSweetie Belle: [stiltedly] You are so careless! [quietly] Good plan, Apple Bloom!\nApple Bloom: [stiltedly] Careless? I will show you who is the one who is careless! [quietly] And great acting, Sweetie Belle!\nScootaloo: [out loud] We're an awesome team!\nApple Bloom: All right!\nPinkie Pie: Yay!\nApple Bloom: Oops.\nPinkie Pie: You're friends again! I knew you would be! Candy cane stripes forever!\n[party cannon squeak]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [sighs]\nScootaloo: Now they'll never let us into Twilight's school.\n\nApple Bloom: Okay, we've tried shirkin' chores, pesterin', disguises, fightin'.\nSweetie Belle: Hmmm... We need to do something new. Something unexpected.\n[muffled crying]\nApple Bloom: Great idea, Scootaloo! We haven't tried cryin' yet.\nSweetie Belle: Yeah! It always works for Rarity.\nScootaloo: I wasn't crying. I think it's coming from outside.\nCozy Glow: [crying]\nSweetie Belle: Aww. She looks so sad. We better go see what's wrong.\nCozy Glow: [continues crying]\nApple Bloom: Hey. Are you okay?\nCozy Glow: Oh. Thank you for asking. But no. I'm having real trouble with... [sniffling] ...the School of Friendship.\nScootaloo: Twilight won't let you go either, huh?\nCozy Glow: Oh, no, it's not that. I'm in her class, but... [sniffling] ...it's too hard! [crying]\nSweetie Belle: Really?\nCozy Glow: I just moved here to go to school, but everything's so new and different. I don't know anypony.\nApple Bloom: Well, now you do. I'm Apple Bloom. This is Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo. We're the Cutie Mark Crusaders.\nCozy Glow: [sniffs] I'm Cozy Glow. It's very nice to meet you, but I don't know if I'll stay long. I'll probably flunk out. I'm having so much trouble with my friendship lessons.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [gasps]\nSweetie Belle: We can help with those!\nScootaloo: We know all about friendship!\nApple Bloom: And studyin' with you would be almost as good as bein' in class!\nCozy Glow: But why would you help me? What's in it for you?\nSweetie Belle: That's how friendship works. When you give from your heart, you don't expect anything back.\nCozy Glow: Well, golly, if you really mean it...\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Uh-huh!\nCozy Glow: I could use some help with my homework. I have to do something nice for each of these ponies. But I don't know anything about them. And it's so hard to talk to ponies you've never met.\nApple Bloom: Well, you're in luck, 'cause we know all of those ponies!\nScootaloo: Get ready for a friendship A-plus!\n\n[zoom!]\nScootaloo: That's Bon Bon. If you wanna do something nice for her, first you gotta figure out what she needs.\nCozy Glow: Well, how am I supposed to do that?\nScootaloo: Just pay attention. Friendship is about listening to others.\nSweetie Drops: Ow. Ow.\nScootaloo: Uh-oh. That cactus keeps pricking her every step she takes. Hmm, if only there was something to protect her from those spines.\nSweetie Drops: [winces]\nCozy Glow: It looks like you need help carrying your cactus, so here's a safe way to take it home. [laughs nervously]\nSweetie Drops: Thank you! That's so thoughtful.\nCozy Glow: I did it!\nScootaloo: Good job! But, uh, next time, maybe don't give away my helmet.\nCozy Glow: Oopsie.\n\nSweetie Belle: Green, purple, yellow. And one more purple. Whew. Sorting all those took longer than I thought.\nCozy Glow: You really think Mrs. Cake will like these new sprinkle shakers?\nSweetie Belle: Mm-hmm. Now she won't have to use rainbow sprinkles all the time. She can just pick the color she wants!\n[bell ringing]\nMrs. Cake: Ooh! I'm sorry, I was out to lunch. Were you fillies waiting for me long?\nCozy Glow: No. Um, these are for you!\nMrs. Cake: Oh, well, what a lovely surprise! I can't wait to try them out!\n[sprinkles shaking]\nMrs. Cake: Look! I made rainbow sprinkles! Aren't they wonderful?\nCozy Glow: But... she... I... [groans]\nSweetie Belle: At least she likes her present?\nCozy Glow: Uh-huh...\n\n[thuds]\n[whistling]\nCozy Glow: Golly. How'd you know that would make him so happy?\nApple Bloom: Friendship means pitchin' in to help others' chores go faster. 'Specially when their special somepony's waitin' for 'em.\n\n[school bell ringing]\n[students chattering and laughing]\nScootaloo: [groans] That class was so boring!\nSweetie Belle: Not even Miss Cheerilee can make the history of radishes exciting.\nApple Bloom: I bet they don't have to learn about that stuff at Twilight's school.\n[zoom!]\n[crash!]\nCozy Glow: Guess what! I got an A on my homework!\nScootaloo: [cheers]\nApple Bloom: Nice goin'!\nCozy Glow: And I never could have done it without your help!\nSweetie Belle: No problem!\nScootaloo: We just wish we could have done more.\nCozy Glow: Actually, you can. Headmare Twilight is giving us a big test at the end of the week, and I could really use your help studying.\nApple Bloom: We wanted to go to Twilight's school more than anything. But helpin' you has been even more fun! You can count on us!\n\n[montage music]\n[Angel munching]\n[magic noises]\nCozy Glow: Um... intelligence?\n\n[magic noises]\n[clattering]\nSweetie Belle and Apple Bloom: [laughing]\nCozy Glow: [giggles]\n\n[music continues]\nApple Bloom and Cozy Glow: [giggling]\n\nCozy Glow: Laughter?\nSweetie Belle: Yes!\nCozy Glow: Is it... control?\n\n[wind blowing]\n[bushes rustling]\n\nCozy Glow: Kindness! Loyalty! Honesty! Generosity! Laughter! Magic!\nCutie Mark Crusaders and Cozy Glow: [cheering]\n\n[students laughing]\nApple Bloom: How'd the test go?\nSweetie Belle: Were there essay questions?\nScootaloo: Did you remember what we taught you?\nCozy Glow: I... failed! [crying]\nApple Bloom: But how could Cozy Glow fail her friendship test?\nTwilight Sparkle: Ahem. I'd like to see you three in my office!\n\nScootaloo: [quietly] I know we wanted to be invited inside, but it kinda went different in my head.\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't believe you'd do something like this!\nApple Bloom: Like what?\nTwilight Sparkle: You are Cozy Glow's tutors, aren't you?\nScootaloo: We've been working with her for days!\nTwilight Sparkle: That's what she told me. So you've been setting her up to fail?\n\n\n\n\nSweetie Belle and Scootaloo: What?!\n\n\nApple Bloom: How?!\n\n\nSweetie Belle and Scootaloo: What?!\n\nApple Bloom: How?!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I know you're upset that I won't let you come to my school, but to teach Cozy all the wrong things out of spite... That's just cruel!\nSweetie Belle: But we taught her all the right things!\nTwilight Sparkle: Then how do you explain these friendship test answers? [reading] \"What are the six Elements of Harmony?\" Five turtlenecks and a cheese grater? \"Who is the Princess of Friendship?\" Your mom?\nApple Bloom: I... I don't understand.\nTwilight Sparkle: Me neither. I never thought you three would pull such a mean prank. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to stay away from my school. And my students.\n[door closes]\nCozy Glow: Oh, no!\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Hmm? [dryly] Yay. Now I'll alphabetize them in reverse order. [sighs] Not much need for a guidance counselor at a school of friendship.\nCozy Glow: [clearing throat]\nStarlight Glimmer: Aah!\n[thud]\nStarlight Glimmer: How much of that did you hear?! Uh, never mind.\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: [laughs nervously] Welcome! Can I get you a comfort pillow? Security blanket? Empathy cocoa?\nCozy Glow: Uh, I just need some advice.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh! Well, I have plenty of that! Anecdotes, insight, midnight confessions... I'm babbling. [clears throat] Go ahead. I'm listening.\nCozy Glow: I think I got my friends in trouble. They helped me study for my friendship test, and I failed it... on purpose.\nStarlight Glimmer: Why would you do that? Uh, sorry. Listening. [sips cocoa]\nCozy Glow: Well, the Cutie Mark Crusaders wanted to go to this school more than anything. So I thought if I showed Headmare Twilight they're bad at friendship, she'd let them come here with me.\nStarlight Glimmer: That's devious. I-I mean, I see. [sips cocoa]\nCozy Glow: I guess I still have a lot to learn about friendship.\nStarlight Glimmer: Actually, I think you're doing all right. Sure, that was a really, really bad way to try to help your friends, but what matters is you wanted to. The reason the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't go to this school is because they'd make better teachers than students.\nCozy Glow: So you do have a place for them here?\nStarlight Glimmer: Hmmm...\n\n[students chattering]\n[scraping]\nApple Bloom: [groans] I bet there's no \"Wonderful World of Cleaning\" lesson at Twilight's school.\nSweetie Belle: [coughs] We'll never find out now.\nScootaloo: [sighs] I still don't get how Cozy failed her test after all that studying.\nSweetie Belle: Or how Twilight could blame us for it!\nApple Bloom: Or how gum can be so sticky!\n[knock on door]\nStarlight Glimmer: Sorry to interrupt, Miss Cheerilee. But can I borrow Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo?\n\n[ominous music]\nScootaloo: We didn't do anything wrong! We promise!\nTwilight Sparkle: I know that. Now. Which is why I wanted to talk to you.\nSweetie Belle: Wait. So we're not in trouble?\nStarlight Glimmer: Just the opposite. Cozy Glow, is there something you'd like to say?\nCozy Glow: This is all my fault. I messed up my test on purpose so we could all go to school together. I'm sorry.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you, Cozy Glow. Honesty is one of the pillars of friendship. [to Cutie Mark Crusaders] But you already know that. Which is why I'd like to give you these.\n[thud]\nSpike: [groans]\nApplejack: They're honorary diplomas, makin' y'all official graduates of this here school.\nRarity: You've more than earned them.\nRainbow Dash: Without even having to study!\nPinkie Pie: [cheering]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [chanting] We are graduates! We are graduates! We are graduates!\nTwilight Sparkle: And if you're interested, I think Starlight has a place for you at my school after all.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Woo-hoo!\nStarlight Glimmer: We could use some friendship tutors on staff. And I hear you're the best out there.\nApple Bloom: Then what are we waitin' for? Let's get tutorin'! Come on, Cozy!\nTwilight Sparkle: And that's why this school needs you as our guidance counselor.\nCutie Mark Crusaders and Cozy Glow: [laughing]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] I've been planning this retreat for weeks, and we're already ten minutes behind! Where is that photographer?!\nPhotographer: ...No-no-no-no-no-no-no!\n[doors open]\nPhotographer: I'm so sorry! Can you forgive me? I don't expect you to forgive me... Forgive me?\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\nStarlight Glimmer: Of course. I'll help you set up your\u2014\nPhotographer: Princess Twilight, thanks so much for this! The Canterlot Historical Society is thrilled to document the friendship work your teachers do! Let me just pretty you all up!\n[poink!]\nPhotographer: Ooh!\n[poink!]\n[poink!]\nPhotographer: [giggles] Ooh!\n[poink!]\n[poink!]\nRainbow Dash: Ow! Hey!\nPhotographer: Don't want a single hair out of place, do we? This is for the history books! Now...\n[camera flashing]\nPhotographer: Well, that's that! Bye!\nPinkie Pie: Waaaait! You forgot Starlight! She needs a picture, too!\nPhotographer: 'Kay.\n[camera flashing]\nPhotographer: Now I'll get out of your manes. I know how busy you are.\n\nPhotographer: Now I have everything I need.\n[transformation noise]\nQueen Chrysalis: [maniacal laughter]\n\n[theme song]\n\nQueen Chrysalis: Yes, I know! We have been planning this for quite some time. [laughing evilly] Oh, thank you, Applejack. My spell can create a copy of anypony I desire. All I need is an image and a piece of the pony. [sniffs] Oh, and this.\n[magic zap]\nQueen Chrysalis: Why copies, Rarity? Because Princess Twilight and her friends control the Elements of Harmony, the most powerful weapon in all Equestria.\n[magic zap]\nQueen Chrysalis: Which means you - will - be - able - to - use - them - too!\n[magic zap]\nQueen Chrysalis: And serve me!\n[magic zap]\nQueen Chrysalis: Together, we will destroy Twilight Sparkle and her meddlesome friends!\n[magic zap]\nQueen Chrysalis: Of course I haven't forgotten Starlight Glimmer! She stole my hive. Turned my subjects against me! So I'll take her friends away while she watches! And then, I'll destroy her! [maniacal laughter]\n[magic zap]\nQueen Chrysalis: With the Elements under my control, I'll build a new hive of Earth ponies, unicorns, and Pegasi, and I will rule as Queen once again!\n[magic sounds]\n[cracking]\n[magic sounds]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmm. At least our retreat isn't too far behind schedule. Get ready for fun!\nRainbow Dash: Are we talking fun fun, or learning pretending to be fun?\nTwilight Sparkle: Both! We've all been so busy teaching, we've hardly had a chance to hang out with each other. And I may have scheduled some friendship activities as well!\nPinkie Pie: Count me in! We can do friendship trust falls and pony pyramids! Oh! And hide and seek! Quick! Find me!\nFluttershy: Well, I love the idea of some quiet time with my best friends.\nPinkie Pie: [screams] You found me!\nRainbow Dash: Rarity, why is Applejack carrying all your stuff?\nRarity: Oh, that's not mine. Yes, I used to overpack a tad, but now it's just the essentials for me. I'm a simple filly.\nApplejack: Normally I wouldn't lug so much gear, but did y'all know this is Starlight's first time campin'?\nStarlight Glimmer: I just never really felt the need to... \"hang out\" in nature.\n[insects buzzing]\nStarlight Glimmer: Home has books, tea, fewer bugs, a roof...\nApplejack: That attitude right there is why I brought the whole kit and caboodle. I'm givin' Starlight the full Apple family campin' experience!\nFluttershy: Um, where are we camping?\nTwilight Sparkle: Right next to the Elements that brought us all together in the first place \u2013 the Tree of Harmony!\n\nQueen Chrysalis: Listen to your queen! We must retrieve the Elements of Harmony!\nMean Pinkie Pie: Hunting down some lame Elements? This is the worst day ever!\nMean Fluttershy: No. Now it's the worst day ever! [laughing cruelly]\nMean Rarity: Those Elements are mine! Along with this rock! Oh, and that twig!\nMean Applejack: I got all kinds o' Elements right here under my hat. I'll let you see 'em for five bits.\nMean Rainbow Dash: [scoffs] Losers.\nMean Twilight Sparkle: Why didn't you just attack them?\nQueen Chrysalis: Excuse me?\nMean Twilight Sparkle: You were close enough to pull hairs from their manes. Why not just take your revenge then?\nQueen Chrysalis: They've defeated my army. I know better than to strike alone. I need\u2014\nMean Twilight Sparkle: Friends?\nQueen Chrysalis: Servants! And the power of the Elements!\nMean Twilight Sparkle: Right. So where are these Elements of Harmony?\nQueen Chrysalis: The location of the most powerful weapon in Equestria isn't something made known to just anypony. I learned they were hidden somewhere in this forest.\nMean Twilight Sparkle: Yeah, well, it is a big forest.\nQueen Chrysalis: [growling]\n\nPinkie Pie: Everypony, stop! And smell these roses! [sniffs] Ahhh! Oh, yeah!\nTwilight Sparkle: [nervous giggle] Right. Roses. Fun. Now, let\u2019s try and stay on schedule.\nRarity: Applejack, darling, anything in that wagon for mane maintenance?\nApplejack: Uh, let's see here. Uh... all right. I got a bandana!\nRarity: Ugh, an entire wagon and no anti-frizz? Darling, you're not even prepared.\nApplejack: I am! For campin'? How ya doin', Starlight?\nStarlight Glimmer: Whoa! Ugh. [flatly] Great.\nBird 1: [tweeting]\nFluttershy: Oh, no! You and your sister fell out of your nest and got separated? That's terrible! Here. I'm sure your home isn't too far away.\n[swing creaking]\nTwilight Sparkle: [yelps] Pinkie! If we keep stopping to have fun, we're never gonna get to the fun things I've got planned!\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] Good point! Last one to the Tree of Harmony is a parasprite! Whoo-hoo!\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\n\n[thud]\nMean Pinkie Pie: I'm sooooo bored. Are we there yet?\nMean Twilight Sparkle: Where yet? We don't even know where we're going!\nQueen Chrysalis: The quicker we search the forest, the quicker we find the Elements.\nMean Applejack: I know where the Elements are. This, uh, here boulder just told me. I swear.\nBird 2: [tweeting]\nMean Fluttershy: You tried to fly out of the nest, but you fell and got lost?\nBird 2: [tweeting]\nMean Fluttershy: [laughing cruelly] Hope you like walking! [laughing cruelly]\nMean Rainbow Dash: [yawns] Come get me when I should care.\nQueen Chrysalis: Where... are... the others?!\nMean Applejack: Uh... A, uh, a bugbear in... plaid socks flew down and, uh, g-grabbed them! Then disappeared! Huh. Craziest thing I ever did see!\nQueen Chrysalis: Turn around. We're going back.\nMean Twilight Sparkle: No. Keep searching. I'll find the others. We can accomplish more if we split our resources.\nQueen Chrysalis: Very well. You have my permission.\nMean Twilight Sparkle: \"Permission\"? You need us way more than we need you, your Majesty! The others are fools. But with me to lead them, there's no reason we can't find the Elements and keep the power for ourselves!\n\n[rustling]\nMean Twilight Sparkle: [gasps]\nPinkie Pie: You're it! Hey, how'd you get ahead of me? You're fast.\nMean Twilight Sparkle: Ugh! I'm looking for Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash.\nPinkie Pie: Aren't they back there?\nMean Twilight Sparkle: They are?\nPinkie Pie: Sure! Unless they're already at the Tree of Harmony.\nMean Twilight Sparkle: What is the Tree of Harmony?\nPinkie Pie: Oh-ho-ho. This is one of your \"activities\", right? Like a friendship quiz? It's the crystal tree that holds the Elements of Harmony. Boom!\nMean Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] Where is it?\nPinkie Pie: [imitates buzzer] It's at the bottom of the stairs in the ravine by the Castle of the Two Sisters. Double boom!\nMean Twilight Sparkle: How do you know? You've seen it?\nPinkie Pie: Mm-hmm. Honestly, Twilight, these questions are super easy.\n\nBird 1: [tweeting]\nFluttershy: Right where you belong.\nBird 1: [tweets]\nFluttershy: Oh, dear. This isn't where I belong. Oh, Rainbow Dash! I'm so glad you're here. I was lost.\nMean Rainbow Dash: Bummer. Later.\n[beat]\nFluttershy: What just happened?\n\nApplejack, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Starlight Glimmer: [overlapping] Fluttershy!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, fantastic. First Pinkie races ahead of us, and now Fluttershy's lost somewhere behind us. My retreat is off to a great start!\nRarity: It's not like Fluttershy to disappear like this.\nApplejack: We'll split up and search for her. We can all meet back at the Tree. Starlight, take the navigation gear and\u2014\nStarlight Glimmer: [quickly] Go with Rarity? Great! Rainbow Dash, you can go with Applejack! [chuckles]\nTwilight Sparkle: I'll find Pinkie Pie.\n\nMean Pinkie Pie: Bored. Bored. Bored.\nQueen Chrysalis: This is ridiculous! Where are my other minions?!\nMean Rarity: Probably plotting to steal my things! [growls]\nMean Applejack: They're at a secret party up in that there tree. Run by a... squirrel named, uh, Jerome. But, uh, y-you need a password to get in.\nQueen Chrysalis: [growls] Enough!\n[thud]\n[slam!]\nQueen Chrysalis: You will go out there and find the others, you will bring them back here, and we will steal the Elements of Harmony so I can destroy Starlight's life like she destroyed mine! [through gritted teeth] Understand?\nMean Rarity, Mean Applejack, and Mean Pinkie Pie: [nervously] Uh-huh!\nMean Applejack: The party password is \"rutabaga\".\n\nMean Fluttershy: [mockingly] Why don't you fly up to your nest? Oh, that's right. You can't! [laughing cruelly]\nBird 1: [tweeting]\nMean Fluttershy: Oh. Nopony asked you. I hope you all freeze this winter!\n[mice squeaking]\nMean Fluttershy: [laughing cruelly]\nFluttershy: Hello again, little friend. I think I may be walking in circles.\nBird 1: [tweeting angrily]\nFluttershy: [gasps] Oh, my! Where did you learn that kind of language? Um, excuse me?\n[animals growling and chittering angrily]\nFluttershy: [whimpering]\n\nMean Rarity: Finally, you found her!\nRainbow Dash: Me? We're looking for Fluttershy!\nApplejack: Where's Starlight?\nMean Rarity: Well, if I knew that\u2014\nRainbow Dash: [grunts] Hey!\nMean Rarity: This is mine! And this as well! Oh, and this is absolutely mine!\nApplejack: Rarity, what in the hay are you gonna do with a fishin' rod?\nMean Rarity: I don't know. But I wants it! [snorts]\n\n[thud]\nRarity: Starlight, darling, you're a gloriously bad camper. And coming from me, that is saying a lot.\nStarlight Glimmer: I know. Want to break it to Applejack for me?\n[rustle]\nMean Applejack: Who's breakin' what now?\n[thud]\nMean Applejack: Who are you?\nStarlight Glimmer: Very funny, Applejack. Still me under all this gear. Starlight.\nMean Applejack: Starlight? How 'bout that? Y'all better come with me. It's, uh, dangerous out here.\nRarity: Applejack, darling, are you all right? You look a little peaky. And where's your wagon?\nMean Applejack: Uh... stolen! Uh, I barely got away! Follow me, and I'll tell ya all about it.\n[clattering]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie! There you are! What are you doing?\n[pop!]\nMean Pinkie Pie: You call that a pop?! Ugh!\nTwilight Sparkle: I thought you were racing to the retreat.\nMean Pinkie Pie: Please. Why would I waste my time on a boring, lame, no-fun retreat?\nTwilight Sparkle: What? Rainbow Dash! I think something's wrong with Pinkie!\nMean Rainbow Dash: Not my problem.\n[splash!]\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\n[pop!]\n\nPinkie Pie: And then we all grew super-long manes with all kinds of colors, and your castle grew out of the ground, and everypony was like, \"Whoa!\" And then we sang this song about rainbows, and\u2014 [gasps]\nFluttershy: [crying]\nPinkie Pie: Fluttershy! What's wrong?\nFluttershy: [crying] Everycreature is mad at me!\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] What?! That can't be right!\nFluttershy: [crying, sniffling]\nMean Twilight Sparkle: [groans] Can we hurry this up? We're on a schedule here!\nPinkie Pie: Twilight, your schedule can wait! Fluttershy's upset.\nMean Twilight Sparkle: Well, tell her to get over it! I'll go get the others. Stay here!\nFluttershy: [crying, sniffling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, great. You upset Fluttershy, too?\nPinkie Pie: You know what, Twilight? Maybe if you weren't so worried about schedules, you'd realize you're the one ruining the retreat for your friends!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Well, if my friends don't care about the retreat I planned for them... maybe they should've stayed home!\nFluttershy: Can't we all just get along?! [crying]\n\nMean Twilight Sparkle: Keep it together. You can do this. You need those imbeciles if your plan is gonna come together.\nQueen Chrysalis: Your plan?\nMean Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] Uh, the plan. I'm just trying to do your bidding, your Majesty.\nQueen Chrysalis: Grub-sitting you six is nothing like controlling my hive! Give me one good reason why I shouldn't just destroy you all and start over!\nMean Twilight Sparkle: Because I know where the Elements of Harmony are. You need me.\nQueen Chrysalis: [maniacal laughter]\n\nMean Rarity: Mine. Mine! [crazed laughter] All mine!\nRainbow Dash: [to Applejack] I'm guessing some kind of curse? Maybe poison joke?\nApplejack: Well, somethin' sure ain't right.\nMean Rarity: What are you plotting back there? I can hear you, you know! Don't think you're going to steal my things! [panting, spluttering]\nApplejack: Hang on. I got a shovel we can use to whack those vines out of the way.\nMean Rarity: [grunting] I knew it! I knew you wanted it all for yourselves! You can't have it!\n[thud]\nMean Rarity: It's mine, you hear me?! All mi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hine! [crazed laughter]\n\nMean Applejack: ...So there I was. Just me and, uh, a bucket of honey. Yeah, yeah, that's the ticket. Uh, b-but I-I survived all by myself in this here forest for, uh, a hundred and... twenty-seven hours!\nRarity: Really? I can't believe you've never told us that story before.\nStarlight Glimmer: She's making a point. We get it. You're the greatest camper in the history of Equestria.\nMean Applejack: Well, I sure don't need any o' that silly stuff you're luggin' around.\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, the things you gave me are silly?!\nMean Applejack: [chuckles] Just look in a mirror. Guess I should've told you that before, huh? [chuckling]\nStarlight Glimmer: [gasps, tearing up] Glad I was so entertaining for you!\nRarity: [to Mean Applejack] I'm going to make sure that she doesn't break a hoof out there, and then you and I are going to have a serious talk!\nQueen Chrysalis: Finally! There. That's all of you. Nopony leaves without my say-so.\nMean Applejack: Now, wait a second. Weren't you just\u2014?\n[magic zap]\nMean Applejack: [gulps]\nQueen Chrysalis: The time for my revenge on Starlight Glimmer has come! Let's see if you're telling the truth about this Tree.

She just wants us to \"stay on schedule\"!\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, I'm sorry, Pinkie! If I knew you thought this was a \"boring, lame, no-fun retreat\", I wouldn't have invited you in the first place!\nPinkie Pie: I never said that!\nApplejack: Sorry, y'all. We would've been here sooner, but we had to take the long way after Rarity ran off with all my stuff.\nRarity: Wha\u2014?! I most certainly did not!\nApplejack: What?! You know I ain't no liar! [to Starlight Glimmer] Where's all your gear?\nStarlight Glimmer: Why? So you can laugh at me some more?!\nRainbow Dash: Hey, hey, we're all friends here!\nFluttershy: Friends?! You left me alone in the woods! [crying]\n[main cast except Twilight arguing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Everypony, quiet! Listen. We know each other really well \u2014 the great stuff and how to get on each other's nerves, too. I wanted a fun trip with my friends. But instead, I got carried away with plans and ruined everything. If you want to forget it all and head home, I won't be offended. I just want us to stop fighting.\nApplejack: [to Starlight Glimmer] Hey, sorry if I got carried away with all that campin' stuff.\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm sorry, too. I should've just told you I'll never like camping. Also, I'll never like camping.\nRarity: Well, if we're all being honest, I can't survive with just this tiny yet fashionable little saddlebag! I miss my things!\nPinkie Pie: [to Twilight Sparkle] I'm sorry that you thought that I thought your plan was lame. Your plans are the most un-lamest!\nRainbow Dash: And I always have fun when we're all together. Even if it's learning pretending to be fun.\nTwilight Sparkle: So... does that mean you still want to have the retreat?\nAll except Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy: Yes!\nFluttershy: If everypony likes me again.\nAll: [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Let's get to that Tree. I have the whole campsite set up and ready.\n\nMean Pinkie Pie: [groans] What's this garbage?\nMean Applejack: Badger installation art! Ya see\u2014\nQueen Chrysalis: Just! Retrieve! The Elements!\nMean Fluttershy: [laughing cruelly]\nMean Rarity: Mine! Mine!\n[clattering]\nMean Rarity: Mine! [crazed laughter]\nMean Twilight Sparkle: Once we get the power of the Elements, no creature \u2013 not even her Majesty \u2013 can tell us what to do. Just follow my lead. Got it?\nMean Ponies: [laughing evilly]\nMean Rarity: Ooh! That one's mine!\n[ping!]\nMean Rarity: [crazed laughter]\n[thud]\nMean Fluttershy: Oops. I'd say sorry, but I'm not!\nMean Rarity and Mean Fluttershy: [grunting]\nMean Twilight Sparkle: Stop it, fools!\n[ping!]\nMean Twilight Sparkle: We need the Elements to take out Chrysalis!

I created you!\n[magic zap]\n[thud]\n[dull pulsating]\n[ping!]\nMean Pinkie Pie: [laughing]\n[ping!]\nMean Twilight Sparkle: [groaning]\n[ping!]\nMean Twilight Sparkle: [groaning]\n[magic sounds]\nMean Twilight Sparkle: [gasps]\n[magic sounds]\nMean Twilight Sparkle: Imbeciles! You ruined everythiiiiiiiing!\n[shimmering sounds]\n[clattering]\nQueen Chrysalis: Servants always fail you in the end! Just wait, Starlight. I will have my revenge!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Are you kidding me?\nPinkie Pie: [laughing] This was... the worst... day... ever!\nAll: [laughing]\nStarlight Glimmer: Come on, everypony. We can fix this campsite in no time.\nApplejack: Spoken like a true camper.\nStarlight Glimmer: Eh, don't push it.\nApplejack and Starlight Glimmer: [chuckling]\nTwilight Sparkle: You know, if we can survive a day like this, I think our friendship is strong enough to handle anything the world can throw at us.\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[chest opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: Who can tell me what these are?\nSandbar: Whoa...\nGallus: Me likey...\nYona: Shiny!\nSmolder: Treasure?\nOcellus: Nope! They're all legendary magical artifacts!\n[beat]\nOcellus: Heh-heh. I've read ahead in Equestrian Cultures and Camaraderie: Volume Seven.\nTwilight Sparkle: You're right, Ocellus. This is the Amulet of Aurora, the Talisman of Mirage, the Helm of Yksler, the Crown of Grover, Knuckerbocker's Shell, and Clover the Clever's Cloak.\nSpike: And the gems are real! Eh, not that I... tasted them.\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Celestia gifted these to our school, since they each represent one of the cultures our students come from. And we'll learn all about them in a Spell-venger Hunt!\n[beat]\nSmolder: [aside, to Sandbar] Is that a pony thing?\nSandbar: Eh.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's a magical scavenger hunt. Each of you will work in pairs to try to find where in the school these artifacts are hidden.\nSpike: The team that finds the most wins a private tour of the Canterlot Archives with Princess Celestia.\nTwilight Sparkle: [giggles]\nSilverstream: [excited squeal] Learning and fun?! Does it get any better than that?!\nGallus: You've been underwater a long time, haven't you?\nTwilight Sparkle: Gallus and Silverstream, sounds like you're our first pair!\nStudents: [gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: What? They'll make a great team.\n[cutie mark glowing]\nYona: Um, why pony glowing?\n\n[doors open]\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait. You all were called on this friendship quest, too?\nFluttershy: It must be a really important one.\nRarity: And terribly far away.\nRainbow Dash: Just getting there will take days!\nApplejack: Do y'all know what this means? There won't be any teachers left to run the school!\nMane Six except Applejack: [gasp]\n\n[theme song]\n\nFluttershy: Should we send our students home?\nPinkie Pie: I say we take 'em with us! Road trip!\nRarity: In the middle of my friendship quilting class? I think not! All of those unfinished seams!

I already have a seventy-point plan in place for this very situation.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: You want me to be headmare?!\nTwilight Sparkle: You're the perfect choice! You're a good leader and an expert in friendship. I trust you to run this school exactly as I would.\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, that's a pretty big responsibility, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: Which is why I've prepared everything you need.\n[bell ringing]\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: The curriculum, rules for the Spell-venger Hunt, dining hall menus for the next six months...\nSpike: Six months?! You're not really gonna be gone that long, are you?\nTwilight Sparkle: ...and Spike. Anything that isn't covered in my files, he'll be able to help you with.\nStarlight Glimmer: Then why not put him in charge?\nSpike: No-ho-ho, thanks. Eh, being a princess for Twilight was hard enough.\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm gonna pretend that made sense. But if you're sure it's what you really want, I promise I won't let you down.\nTwilight Sparkle: I knew I could count on you.\n[door closes]\nSpike: [yells]\nStarlight Glimmer: Great.

Um, why are you here now?\nDiscord: To fill in for Twilight, of course, as head-draconequus. I seem to recall a whole song about how this school is where you make your own rules. Now, who better at that than me?\nSpike: Then you also must've heard Starlight is in charge now.\nDiscord: Really? I thought there must be some mistake.\n[flick]\nStarlight Glimmer: Nope. Twilight picked me for the job. And she left pretty detailed instructions for me to follow.\nDiscord: Well, I'm sure that she wouldn't mind a few tiny suggestions. [snaps fingers]\n[flash]\nDiscord: [writing] \"Item one \u2013 Gravity is optional.\"\n[warbling]\nStarlight Glimmer: Whoa-oa!\nDiscord: \"Item two \u2013 The school's new mascot is an ambidextrous marmoset.\"\n[marmoset mascot squeaks]\nDiscord: \"Item three\u2014\"\nStarlight Glimmer: Not gonna happen. I promised Twilight I'd handle this her way. So thanks, but no thanks.\nDiscord: Reeeeeeally? Well, we'll see if you change your mind. [snaps fingers]\n[flash]\n[splash]\nSpike: Uh-oh. When we play Ogres & Oubliettes and he puts that many E's in \"really\", the things don't usually end well.\nStarlight Glimmer: Don't worry, Spike. Discord and I are old \"save Equestria\" buddies. He'll be fine. Now, what's next on Twilight's list?\n[door opens]\n\nSpike: Okay. I hid the artifacts for the Spell-venger Hunt and ordered school supplies for the week. All you have to worry about is teaching class.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] Thanks, Spike. Maybe we will get through this okay.\n[doors open]\n[peacocks call]\n[Castle Thunder]\n[typewriter clicking]\nDiscord: Come in, come in. You'll let the twittermites out. [munches]\nSpike: Twittermites?\n[swarming]\nSpike: Ow!\n[splash]\nStarlight Glimmer: Discord! What are you doing?!\nSpike: [gasps for air]\nDiscord: Nopony was at your desk. Imagine what Twilight would say. [imitating Twilight] Oh, how could you, Starlight?! You've broken my trust and failed me completely! [normal voice] Oh, don't worry. I'll cover for you. By the way, I hope you like Limburger cheese. I got a month's supply for the teacher's lounge.

And it was next on our to-do list.\nStarlight Glimmer: Which teachers did you hire?\n\n[stomp]\nIron Will: They call it \"making friends\", because you have to make creatures be your friends! Show me what you've got, yak!\nYona: [clears throat, quietly] Be my friend.\nIron Will: If you're quiet, I don't buy it!\nYona: [louder] Be my friend!\nIron Will: I've heard pudding that's more convincing!\nYona: [huffs, even louder] Be!

I thought you were in charge here. But I'm happy to pitch in if you need me.\n[flash]\nStarlight Glimmer: What I need is for you to leave!\nDiscord: [snaps fingers]\n[flash]\nDiscord: Happy now?\nSpike: Come on, Discord. You know that's not what she means.\nDiscord: Fine! From now on, I won't try to help. At! All!\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans] Thanks, Spike. Let's just hope he stays gone.\nSpike: I wouldn't count on it. I think Discord's trying to test you.\nStarlight Glimmer: But why? I thought we were friends.\nSpike: Well, it's kinda what he does. Even to ponies or dragons he cares about.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, well, I'm ready for him. I told Twilight I'd run her school right, and I'm gonna keep that promise. No matter what.\n\n[nighttime ambience]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Good morning, students! I know there's been a little bit of adjustment since the professors left for their trip.

And what did you say?\nVoice on bananaphone: [garbled sped-up gibberish]\nDiscord: [gasps] You did not!\nTrixie: Discord! Why are you here?!\nDiscord: Why, I'm a student of friendship, of course. Unless you don't think you're good enough to teach me.\nTrixie: Of course I am! No fruit calls in my class!\n[banana peels]\nDiscord: [gulps]\nTrixie: Magic is the most important element of friendship. So, today I, the Great and Powerful Trixie, will put on a magic show!\nDiscord: [snaps fingers]\n[Pigasus squeals]\n[ursa major roaring]\nStudents: [scream]\nDiscord: [chuckles] I'm learning so much.

Oh, this is great!\nSandbar: [pants] Hey, coach, we need a break.\nDiscord: Friendship is about honesty. So believe me when I say... we're not stopping!

[grunts]\n[bugbear growls]\n[zap!]\n[bugbear whimpers]\nStarlight Glimmer: Discord, that's enough! Endangering students crosses the line! I don't know why you're trying to ruin this school, but it stops now!\n[flash]\nDiscord: I wouldn't be so sure.\nStarlight Glimmer: This is your last warning.\nSpike: Hey-hey-hey! Take it easy, Starlight! Discord's your friend, remember?\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, he's not acting like it!\nSpike: [huffs] She's right, Discord. What's your problem?\nDiscord: My problem? How is the fact that Twilight decided to put an incompetent, power-hungry unicorn in charge of her school my problem?!\nStarlight Glimmer: [gasps, yells]\n[zap!]\n[crackles]\nStudents: [shudder]\nStarlight Glimmer: [nervous laughter] Don't worry. I just banished him from school grounds forever. He's fine.\nSpike: That probably made things worse. Why didn't you just talk to Discord?\nStarlight Glimmer: Because he's right about one thing. I've been doing a terrible job as headmare.\nSpike: No, you haven't. Discord is just bein'... Discord.\nStarlight Glimmer: Maybe. But I wonder why me being in charge bothers him so much.\n[school bell rings]\nSpike: We can figure that out after the Spell-venger Hunt. C'mon!\n\n[doors open]\nStarlight Glimmer: For this afternoon's Spell-venger Hunt, you'll need to use the artifacts' history to find where they're hidden in the castle. When you spot one, touch it with a magic shield to keep track of your score.\nSpike: Twilight left the list of your hunt partners before she left. I'll pass out the shields.\nStarlight Glimmer: Ready... set... Spell-venger Hunt!\n[gong strikes]\nStudents: [chattering]\nSpike: C'mon! We can use Twilight's observatory to watch the teams!\n\nStudents: [chatter continues]\nSmolder: I hope you know where you're going.\nOcellus: To the Helm of Yksler!\nSmolder: Eh, works for me.\nOcellus: In our book, it says Yksler was an honorable yak warrior. Any enemies that saw him put down their weapons in peace. I think his artifact must be in one of these suits of armor.\nSmolder: I'm guessing that one.\n[shields flash]\nOcellus: Yes! One down, five to go!\n[slaps]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Awww, Ocellus and Smolder found their first artifact! Wait. What's that?\n\nOcellus: Uh, I don't think that's part of the Spell-venger Hunt!\nOcellus and Smolder: [scream]\nOcellus: The school is haunted!\nSmolder: And not cool!\n\nStarlight Glimmer and Spike: [gasp]\n\nSilverstream: We're totally gonna win this Spell-venger Hunt!\nGallus: Yeah, I doubt that. But at least I know where one of the artifacts is. Saw Spike hide it yesterday.\n[thud]\nGallus: The Crown of Grover! Score!\n[shimmer!]\nGallus: They say it's magic and King Grover used it to become the first ruler of Griffonstone. I know, pretty sweet, right?\nSilverstream: You paid attention in class!\nGallus: What?! I-If you ever tell an\u2014\n[slam!]\nGallus: Whoa!\nSilverstream: 3D painting!\nKing Grover Painting: [screeches]\nGallus and Silverstream: [scream]\nChangeling Painting: [hisses]\n[students screaming]\nPony Painting: [hisses]\n[students screaming]\nDiscord's Ghost: [laughing]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Yup, that's definitely Discord. This is not good.\nSpike: I thought you banished him from the school.\nStarlight Glimmer: Only his body. Apparently, his ghost can come and go just fine. Let's go. We have to stop this.\n[lift clanking]\nSpike: How? No offense, but I don't think magic is the answer against Discord.\nStarlight Glimmer: This time, I'm not using magic.\n\nYona: Hmm... What Yona look for?\nSandbar: The Shell of Knuckerbocker. It's like a seashell, but if you blow into it, you call a dragon! There's a sweet poem in our book about it. \"Climb to the heights with dragon flight.\" [gasps] Like flight of stairs!\nYona: Yona take pony word for it.\n[squish]\nYona: Huh?\nSandbar: [grunts] What's happening?!\nYona: Ugh! Yona not know! But Yona do know Yona not like Spell-venger Hunt!\nDiscord's Ghost: [laughing] Boo! Boo! Boo!\n[students screaming]\nOcellus: [yelps] Whoa!\nStarlight Glimmer: Everycreature, stop!\nSilverstream: B-B-B-But the school is haunted!\nStarlight Glimmer: It's not haunted. It's Discord.\n[poof!]\nDiscord's Ghost: Headmare Starlight! Look at me! Look! I won the Spell-venger Hunt! Well done, me! Now what's my prize?\nSpike: Detention.\nDiscord's Ghost: Well, that's disappointing.\nStarlight Glimmer: Discord, you can't keep messing up the school.\nDiscord's Ghost: On the contrary. I think I rather can. And will.\nStarlight Glimmer: Then I have just one thing to say to you.\nDiscord's Ghost: Oh, do go on.\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm sorry.\nDiscord's Ghost: What?\n[zap!]\nStarlight Glimmer: I had to stop thinking like a headmare and start thinking like a guidance counselor to finally understand. You felt left out.\nDiscord: Uh... [stuttering] I don't know what you're getting at.\nStarlight Glimmer: Nopony ever invited you to the school. And when you offered to help, I didn't listen. I was so worried about doing things Twilight's way, I didn't stop to think about being a good friend. I'd like to apologize for that. And offer you the job of vice headmare.\nSpike: Huh?\nSilverstream: Really?!\nGallus: What?!\nOcellus: Why?!\nYona: No!\nSmolder: Him?!\nSandbar: Totally confused.\nDiscord: I accept! I mean, I-I-I suppose I can find some time in my busy schedule to help you out. But I will need my own office, expense account, parking space...\nSpike: You're new to the world of education, aren't you?\nStarlight Glimmer: Next time you want something, just ask for it, all right?\nDiscord: But then we'd miss out on all those delightful misadventures.\nSpike: Hey! Watch the wings!\nStarlight Glimmer: Now, Vice Headmare Discord, if you'll help me get this Spell-venger Hunt back in order.\nDiscord: [snaps fingers] Everything is re-hidden.\n[rattling]\nSilverstream: [screams]\nDiscord: [chuckles] Well, with a few surprises.\n[doors open]\nTwilight Sparkle: Discord! I can't believe you tricked us into going on a friendship quest that wasn't real!\nDiscord: Oh, back so soon?\nRarity: A glamour spell on our cutie marks?\nRainbow Dash: A fake summons from the map?\nPinkie Pie: Hey, at least we got to go spelunking in that really creepy cave with all those eyeless worm creatures chasing us.\nYona: Oh, Yona so glad ponies back!\nApplejack: Uh, y'all get the feelin' we missed somethin'?\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks for taking care of the school, Starlight.\nStarlight Glimmer: It was a challenge. Heh. But I think things turned out just the way you'd have handled them.\nSpike: [to Discord] Guess this means you're not vice headmare anymore.\nDiscord: Oh, poo!

Yona offended by accusation!\nTwilight Sparkle: We don't know what happened. Maybe this wasn't even on purpose. But I want to give whoever caused this mess a chance to tell the truth and explain themselves. I'll make it easy for you. Close your eyes. Now, if you did this, raise your hoof. Or claw. Or whatever.\n[beat]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Come on, Spike. Looks like we have to\u2014 Spike, you can open your eyes.\nSpike: What? Oh!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, what about me?\nTwilight Sparkle: You all can.\nRainbow Dash: [chuckles]\nTwilight Sparkle: But since nocreature took responsibility for this mess, you're all gonna have to help clean it up before you can go home.\nYoung Six: [protesting]\nSmolder: Why do I have to stay?!\nSandbar: Aw, but the holidays!\n[magic sounds]\nTwilight Sparkle: While you're cleaning, we'll bring you into my office one at a time. Since honesty is one of the Elements of Harmony, we want to give you each a chance to tell us the truth.\nRainbow Dash: And once we find out who did it, just you wait! We're gonna...! We'll...! What are we gonna do exactly?\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] The guilty party won't be going home over Hearth's Warming break. She or he will stay here for some one-on-one friendship lessons.\nSilverstream: But what if none of us confesses?\nTwilight Sparkle: Then... [sighs] I guess there's no holidays for anycreature. You'll all stay over the break.\nYoung Six: [gasp]\n\n[water splashing]\n[splat]\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: All right, let's get to the bottom of this. Who wants to be interviewed first?\nGallus: Eh. I'll go. Beats mop duty.\nSilverstream: Hey, I know! We can make a game out of this! See who finishes cleaning up first!\nYona: Woo-hoo! Yak win! Yak best at cleaning! [grunting]\nSmolder: Let's save time and cut to the chase. Which one of you did it?\nOcellus: I would never do something this horrible! I love Hearth's Warming Eve! And I do not want to miss going home for it.\nSandbar: Huh. I didn't even know changelings celebrated Hearth's Warming.\nOcellus: Oh, yes! It's our favorite holiday! Well, since Headmare Twilight shared it with us last year. She gave our hive very clear instructions.\n\nOcellus: [clears throat, reading] \"Welcome to the traditions and fun of Hearth's Warming! Here's a guide to help you enjoy this celebration of pony history. Families start the holidays by putting the tree up!\"\n\n[creaking]\n\nOcellus: [reading] \"Thirsty? Dive into some holiday punch!\"\n\n[splash!]\nChangelings: [laughing]\n\nOcellus: [reading] \"Just before bed, everypony exchanges gifts.\"\n\nOcellus: It doesn't say how long we keep doing this.\n\nOcellus: [reading] \"And to finish celebrating, you can build a fire, light it up, and sing carols.\"\n\n[Changelings]:\nCarols, carols, carols, carols, caroooools\n[laughing]\n\nCarols, carols, carols, carols, caroooools\n\nSandbar: You might have misunderstood things just a little.\nOcellus: Eh. We may not have done everything exactly the way you do. But we made our own traditions! And I can't wait to do it all again this year!\nSmolder: If we ever get out of here.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ocellus? Your turn.\n[foreboding music]\n[doors close]\nSilverstream: What happened?\nGallus: What do you think happened? I told her I didn't do it.\nYona: Ugh! Yona tired of waiting! Yaks always home for holidays!\nSandbar: How do you celebrate Hearth's Warming in Yakyakistan, Yona?\nYona: Yaks do not. Our holiday much better. Is called Snilldar Fest. Night before, yaks gather things to smash and put them in big pile. Then in morning, we smash them! In afternoon, we smash them again! In evening\u2014\nGallus: So it's just about smashing stuff, like all your other holidays.\nYona: No! How griffon get that idea? This holiday about so much more. Last year, for example. Most perfect Snilldar ever.\n\nYona: [voiceover] Whole family \u2013 grandpa, grandma yak, Yona's brother, sister, mother, father yak \u2013 all go to woods singing yak song.\n[Yona and family]\nYak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!\nYak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!\nYak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!\nYona: [voiceover] Calves in family pick out perfect smashing log. Then yaks smash it!\n[yaks yelling and grunting]\nYona: [voiceover] Then yak family build perfect snow fort... and smash it!\n[crash!]\nYona: [voiceover] Then we hang perfect things on perfect moss pile and\u2014\n\nYak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!\nYak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!\nYak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!\n\nAll but Yona: You smash it.\nYona: What you think yaks are, barbarians? Moss pile is for special family rituals. Last year, ritual for Yona.\n\nYona: [voiceover] All yak family gather around Yona and braid Yona hair for first time.\n\nGallus: So, to recap... Your holiday is about smashing things and family.\nYona: Two most perfect things ever put together. Happy Snilldar Fest! [yelling and grunting]\nSilverstream: Happy Snilldar to you too, Yona! It's so cool to learn new traditions from new friends!\n[clatter]\nSmolder: Yeah, well, one of these new friends has gotten us all in trouble. And they'd better confess soon.\nOcellus: Sandbar? Sorry, but they said they want you to go in next.\n[mop clatters]\nSilverstream: Why the rush to get home, Smolder? Like you said, dragons don't really have holidays, do they?\nSmolder: Meh.\nOcellus: [gasps] That's so sad! You must do something in the winter for fun.\nSmolder: Well, we do have the Feast of Fire. Everydragon gets together and tells stories. The best one wins a pile of gemstones.\nYona: Ooh, what story won last year?\nSmolder: It was called \"A Dream Come True\".\nSilverstream: Come on, now you've gotta tell it!\nSmolder: Ugh, fine. Once upon a time, there was this sad little dragon.\n\n[thunderclap]\nSmolder: [narrating] Her name was Scales. She lived alone in the wilderness with nothing to eat.\n[stomach growls]\nSmolder: [narrating] But one night, as she sat alone in a storm, she heard something. It was the Dragon Lord! Scales was scared, but the Dragon Lord told her not to be afraid, that he was taking her to the Dragon Lands for a great feast.\n[dragons munching]\nSmolder: [narrating] Scales sat with the Dragon Lord's family and friends and had the biggest, best dinner of gemstones she'd ever eaten! Then, while the dragons were telling stories, Scales thought it would be so easy to seize power from this feeble and sensitive Dragon Lord. She saw her chance... and took it!\n[flames bursting]\nSmolder: [narrating] She claimed the Bloodstone Scepter and took over the Dragon Lands! [as Scales, evil laughter] And forced the Dragon Lord to live out in the cold, just as she used to!\n\nOcellus: That's a horrible story!\nSmolder: Maybe to you. But dragons like hearing about weak, kind creatures getting defeated.\nRainbow Dash: Silverstream! You're up! Let's go!\n[door closes]\nSmolder: So, did you tell them you did it?\nSandbar: What?! No way! Why would I say that?\nSmolder: You already live in Ponyville. Staying here over break is no big deal.\nYona: School of Friendship good place for pony to have pony holiday.\nSandbar: I'd still rather spend it with my family at home. Oh! That reminds me! I have the best holiday story ever! It's called...\n\nSandbar: [voiceover] \"The Day My Hearth's Warming Doll Almost Fell into the Fire!\"\nAll but Sandbar: [sounds of awe]\nSandbar: [voiceover] Just before we went to bed, my mom, my dad, and my sister all put our Hearth's Warming Dolls up on the mantel, just like we do every year. But this year, I put my doll too close to the edge, and it fell!\nSandbar: [in slow motion] Nooooooo!\n\nOcellus: [gasps] And?!\nSandbar: My doll hit the floor. But it could have gone in the fire!\nSmolder: [sarcastic] That's a great story. And you told it really well.\nSandbar: Yeah. It was a Hearth's Warming miracle.\n[door opens]\nRainbow Dash: Next! Smolder, come with me. Yona, Twilight's waiting for you.\n[door closes]\nOcellus: The last two. So if neither one of them confesses, that means...\nSilverstream: We're never going home!\n\nOcellus: We'll be here forever!\nSandbar: Beyond forever.\nSilverstream: But I can't miss the Three Days of Freedom Celebration!\nGallus: [sarcastic] How long does that last?\nSilverstream: It used to be only one day, but now to commemorate our escape from the Storm King, we're adding two more days of awesome! See?\nGallus: There's a book?\nSilverstream: Mm-hmm! Queen Novo had these made for the Mount Aris board of tourism to explain it all to guests!\n\nSilverstream: [voiceover] We'll spend the first night in Seaquestria, thanking the ocean for protecting us from the Storm King. Sea-dancing, whale-singing, shell-stringing... Lots of \"ing\"'s.\n[splash]\nSilverstream: [voiceover] The second day will be on Mount Aris, with sky-dancing and a wind song in the Harmonizing Heights to celebrate the Storm King's defeat. Then the third day, everycreature will party together, on land and sea! Grandparents and parents and sisters, uncles, brothers, acquaintances, neighbors, and cousins. And at the end of the night, Queen Novo is gonna give out presents!\n\nGallus: Wait. Hold on. \"Cousins\"? What are those?\nOcellus: Your aunts and uncles' children. You know, part of your family. Heh. Oh. You're teasing us again, right?\n[door opens]\nSandbar: I'm guessing neither one of you confessed.\nYona: [sighs] Headmare Twilight say wait here.\nSilverstream: Maybe they're changing their minds about sending us home.\nSmolder: Why would they? Face it. We're stuck here.\nOcellus: [sniffles] But-but-but I have to go home!\nSilverstream: My mom makes the best kelp fritters.\nSandbar: How can you be so cool about this?\nSmolder: We're mad. We just show it differently.\nSandbar: More like you don't show it at all.\nYona: What pony getting at?\nSilverstream: Maybe it wasn't just one prankster. Maybe there were three of you. And you're trying to hide your guilt by not being upset!\nOcellus: It does make sense.\nGallus: Guys, stop it.\nSmolder: Or maybe whoever did it is only pretending to be upset to throw us off.\nOcellus: Me?! But I didn't!\nGallus: Come on, let it go.\nAll but Gallus: [arguing]\nSandbar: Come on! Ocellus, you know you did it! Just fess up!\nAll but Gallus: [shouting]\nGallus: I said, stop fighting! That's not what the holidays are about! No matter what you call them or how you celebrate! D-Do you know how lucky you all are? With your stories about sharing and-and kindness and getting together with everycreature that you care about?\nOcellus: But griffons do that too, don't they?\nSmolder: Some holiday about a moon?\nGallus: [sighs] Blue Moon Festival. The one time of year when griffons are nice to each other. Well, as nice as we can be.\n\nGallus: [voiceover] Families get together to eat and then complain about the food and give each other presents they don't like and mostly just try not to yell at each other.\n\nSilverstream: Well, at least you get to be with your family.\nGallus: No... because I don't have a family.\n\nSandbar: [voiceover] What about Grampa Gruff?\nGallus: [voiceover] That's just his name. He's not anygriff's actual grandpa. I felt like I never had a place in Griffonstone.\n\nGallus: Then I came here and, well, met all of you. So I don't want to go home for the break. And that's why... I did it!\nYona: [gasps] Griffon mess up decorations?!\nGallus: Yeah. It was me. I put goo powder in the Fire of Friendship.\nAll but Gallus: [gasps]\nSandbar: So it wasn't Ocellus?\nOcellus: Why would you ruin things for us?\nGallus: I didn't plan to! I just figured if I made a mess, our teachers would make us stay to clean up. We'd be together a little longer.\nSmolder: Well, it worked, didn't it?\nGallus: Better than I thought. And when Headmare Twilight threatened to cancel winter break, that meant I would get to be with all of you through the entire holiday. That's why I didn't confess.\nSandbar: So, why are you admitting this now?\nGallus: I hated seeing all you fighting and-and blaming each other. That's the opposite of what all your holidays mean. Except maybe yours, Smolder. I can't keep all of you from the happiness of your homes and families just because I feel bad. I'm sorry. Don't worry. You won't have to tell our teachers. I will.\nTwilight Sparkle: You don't have to. We already know.\nRainbow Dash: We kinda guessed it was you. But we wanted to give you the chance to tell the truth.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm proud that you did, and I'm glad to see you've been paying attention in Professor Applejack's honesty classes. But you're still going to have to make amends and stay over break for extra friendship lessons by yourself.\nSilverstream: I'll stay with him.\nOcellus: Me, too!\nYona: Yona stay also!\nSandbar: I'm staying!\n[beat]\nSmolder: What? All right. I guess pony holidays can't be that bad.\nSandbar: Now you can finally know what it's like to spend Hearth's Warming with friends who care about you.\nRainbow Dash: [whispering, to Twilight Sparkle] Looks like they don't really need any extra lessons.\nTwilight Sparkle: Since you obviously know that Hearth's Warming is about coming together, I'd be honored if all of you would join my friends as guests at our holiday table.\nYoung Six: [cheering]\nTwilight Sparkle: After we finish cleaning up.\nYoung Six: [cheering]\n\nSandbar: Hey, this reminds me of another story! \"The Time I Almost Spilled Grape Juice on the White Couch\"!\nSmolder: Does it have a depressing ending?\nOcellus: I'm not sure pony stories work that way.\nYona: Gallus want Yona braid feathers?\nGallus: Uhhh... pass.\n[Silverstream]\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again!\n\nHearth's Warming Eve is here once again!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nStar Swirl the Bearded: [voiceover] Dear Twilight, it is difficult to express how grateful I am to you for teaching me the power of friendship.\nRare Find: [grunts]\nStar Swirl the Bearded: [voiceover] You would think after more than a thousand years, there would be nothing left to learn.\n[wind whistling]\n[clang!]\nStar Swirl the Bearded: [voiceover] And yet, even a pony as old as I can continue to be surprised by how much there is to know.\n[teleportation zap]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [reading] \"I hope you find these postcards enjoyable, and I look forward to seeing you again, though I can't say when my journey will be complete.

Of course, if he really wants to learn about friendship, he could just come to our school.\n[door opens]\nCozy Glow: Professor Sparkle? The mailpony just came with, uh, a few things.\n[door squeaks]\nRarity: Ooh! The sewing machines I ordered for my class!\nCozy Glow: These came, too. I wasn't sure what to make of them.\nRarity: These machines were costly, but I am quite certain the friendship lessons I can teach my students with them will be invaluable.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\nRarity: Oh, don't worry, darling. I'll think of something. And I didn't use the school funds to buy these. I made the purchase entirely with my own bits.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's not that. It's this!\nRarity: [reading] \"Why waste your time at a friendship school that's just a school? Learn everything they teach and more at Friendship University\"?!\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Who would open another friendship school?\nRarity: Oh, pfft! I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. You're the Princess of Friendship. What could this other school possibly offer?\nSmolder: It isn't just another friendship school. It's a university!\nOcellus: It says they teach the same lessons of competing schools in half the time. That's twice the learning!\nGallus: And it's in Las Pegasus? If Professor Rarity lets us skip her sewing class \u2013 road trip!\nYoung Six: [excited chatter]\nRarity: I think we need to look into this school.\n\nRarity: I don't like to judge solely on appearances. But... what kind of friendship school is this?\n\"Polo Play\": Only the best friendship school in the west... and maybe all of Equestria!\n[ponies cheering]\nTwilight Sparkle: There's more ponies in here than at our whole school.

But who would accredit this place?\nChancellor Neighsay: Why, the EEA, of course.\nTwilight Sparkle: Chancellor Neighsay?!\nChancellor Neighsay: The Equestria Educational Association has taken an interest in institutions that teach friendship in a pony-first environment. Surely you didn't think your school has a monopoly on the concept?\nRarity: Well, she did write the book on it.\nChancellor Neighsay: Ah, yes. How to teach friendship to creatures who will one day use it as a weapon against us.\nTwilight Sparkle: How could they use friendship as a weapon?!\nChancellor Neighsay: You tell me. It's your book. Meantime, this university appears to be a promising option for ponies who'd prefer to stick to the EEA book on the subject.\nTwilight Sparkle: You can't be serious. They're obviously up to something. It's Flim and Flam!\nFlim: [gasps] Well, that certainly wasn't friendly.\nChancellor Neighsay: One would think the headmare of a school of friendship \u2013 albeit an unaccredited one \u2013 would behave differently. Unless she was trying to undermine the competition? Hmm?\n[ponies gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: I\u2014 No! What?! I-I am not!\nAudience Pony: I did think the Princess of Friendship would be friendlier.\nFlam: Now, now, fillies and gentlecolts. Let's show the princess just how friendly we are by signing up for some classes!\n[ponies cheering]\nFlim: Why don't I show you around?\n\nYeah!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sorry, but approval from the EEA won't convince me that this school is what you promise.\nFlim: And what would it take to convince you?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, somepony whose opinion I respect, for one.\nFlim: Really? Somepony like... this?\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle and Rarity: [gasp]\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Twilight?\nRarity: Uh-oh.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Star Swirl? What are you doing here?\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Why, studying friendship at Flim and Flam's wonderful school!\nRarity: Oh, please. I think I know a disguise when I see one. Take off that ridiculous beard... Flam!\n[stretching sound]\nStar Swirl the Bearded: [screams]\nFlam: How's it going in here?\n[snap!]\nStar Swirl the Bearded: [groans] It-It's really me.\nChancellor Neighsay: I'd heard rumors you've returned, but I didn't believe it until now. And if a pony of your stature is studying here, there really isn't anything else I need to see. I, Chancellor Neighsay, hereby confer upon Friendship University complete and unreserved EEA accreditation!\nTwilight Sparkle: I... I don't understand. Why would you come here and not my school?\nStar Swirl the Bearded: My travels brought me to Las Pegasus. I didn't come for the school, but Flim and Flam convinced me to try it out.\nTwilight Sparkle: You can't trust Flim and Flam! They tried to con the Apples out of their farm! They sold fake health tonic! They run a resort in Las Pegasus!\nFlam: Technically, our resort is a legitimate business.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: I spent a thousand years thinking the worst of a \"bad\" pony. You taught me to look for the best in him. Whatever Flim and Flam's past may be, starting this school shows they want to change for the better.\nTwilight Sparkle: I wish I could believe that.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Besides, what's untrustworthy about opening a school of friendship? They don't even charge for classes.\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know. But I know they're up to something. And until I find out, I'm begging you, come to my school instead.\nChancellor Neighsay: I understand feeling threatened by competition, but my word, Princess. I wonder if the ill manners of the creatures at your school aren't contagious. I think I will take my leave before I become infected.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Twilight, I promise I'll visit your school soon. But for now, perhaps it's best if you return there.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: You don't think they're running an actual friendship school, do you?\nRarity: Darling, of course not. Which is why we have to investigate!\nTwilight Sparkle: But we can't go poking around the school. Everypony'll think I'm still just \"threatened by the competition\".\nRarity: Only if we do it as ourselves.\n[door opens]\n[door closes]\n\n[door opens]\n[door closes]\nRarity: In these disguises, we could pass as students at out own school.\nTwilight Sparkle: [muffled] I don't know, Rarity.\nRarity: Ah-ah. What did I say about using our real names?\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry, \"Plainity\". But I'm pretty sure this isn't enough of a disguise.\n[door closes]\n\"Polo Play\": Hey, strangers! Are you two new here?\nRarity: [blows bubblegum] We sure are. Completely new.\n\"Polo Play\": Great! See ya in class!\nRarity: [squeals] Now, I've read enough Shadow Spade to know the key to going undercover is rehearsing your backstory. [clears throat] [in affected voice] I'm \"Plainity\", and I love bland old normal stuff. No frills for me. [normal voice] Okay! Your turn.\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans] My name's Eyepatch. I have an eye patch.\nRarity: Perfect! Now, how do we start our investigation?\nTwilight Sparkle: I think we should split up. You enroll in some classes and find out what they're actually teaching. I'll look around and see what I can find, assuming I'm not recognized.\n\nFlam: Welcome, newest students! Let's dive right in, shall we? One of the most important elements of friendship is being thoughtful. True or false?\n[students chattering eagerly]\nRarity: If by \"thoughtful\" you mean \"generous\", I'd say true.\nFlam: Correct! [laughs] It was a trick question. Very impressive, Miss...?\nRarity: Plainity.\nFlam: Well, well, well, Miss Plainity, keep it up and you'll be ready for our next level in no time!\n[students' sounds of awe]\nFlam: Now, let's see if you can demonstrate for the class. What's something generous you could do for... me right now?\n[zip!]\nFlam: Class, Plainity here is now my star pupil. If any of you want a chance at studying with Star Swirl, I'd take notes on her every action.\n[writing sounds]\n\n[door creaks]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hello? The door is open, so I'll just assume it's okay to come in and look around. Unless somepony says it's not. All right, then.\n[door closes]\nTwilight Sparkle: [reading] \"The Element of Laughter and its applications.\" Okay, that seems pretty genuine. \"When to support your friends' decisions and when to talk sense.\" Huh. That's actually kind of interesting. Aha! \"Friendship University's true goal... is to help friends become better friends\"? [groans] Where is the proof that it's all a scam?\nFlam: There isn't any!\n[click]\n[camera flashes]\nFlim: Twilight Sparkle! Did you really think an eye patch was enough of a disguise?\nTwilight Sparkle: No, I didn't!\nFlam: Well, then we agree that everypony will recognize the Princess of Friendship in this photo of you sneaking into our office.\nFlim: I can see the headline now! \"Princess of Jealousy! Twilight Sparkle Bent on Ruining Her Competition!\"\nFlam: So sad. A news story like that would destroy your reputation. Nopony will want to go to your school after that.\n\nFlam: Just wait until the papers get a hold of this!\nFlim: \"Princess Unhinged!\" It'll be the talk of Equestria!\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Well, gentleponies, I've finished another stack. The lessons in these worksheets are quite fascinating. Twilight? What's going on here?\nFlim: Oh, just your prot\u00e9g\u00e9 getting caught snooping in our office in disguise! Well, sort of.\nFlam: Oh, honestly, Princess Twilight, envy does not look good on you.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm not envious! I know these two are up to something. I'm just trying to find out what.\nStar Swirl the Bearded: The only pony I see who is up to something is the pony in this picture, and it is not the princess I know.\nFlim: Well, it's about to be the princess all of Equestria knows.\nFlam: Unless... you decided to drop the whole \"uncover the scam\" thing.\nFlim: Then we'll rip this silly picture up and not let it completely and utterly ruin you and your school.\nTwilight Sparkle: [whimpers]\n\nRarity: You can be generous with all sorts of things. Gifts, compliments, your time.\n[ponies chattering excitedly]\nRarity: Hey, Eyepatch! Where's your eye patch? [gasps] Was your cover blown?\nTwilight Sparkle: You could say that. Flim and Flam took a picture of me sneaking into their office.\nRarity: Were we wearing our eye patch?\nTwilight Sparkle: If I don't stop investigating, they're going to tell everypony that I'm trying to sabotage their school because I'm jealous.\nRarity: But-But-But that's ridiculous!\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know. Maybe I am just upset that Star Swirl came here instead of my school. Flim and Flam may have turned over a new leaf. We should probably just go home.\nRarity: Twilight, you are not the kind of pony to let your emotions cloud your judgment. If you think Flim and Flam are up to no good, you can't give up, even if their lessons really are impressive.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait, what?!\nRarity: Which reminds me. Can you get a message to Spike? I want to return those sewing machines. I need the bits if I'm going to keep advancing here. Tuition's free, but the worksheets sure aren't. [laughs]\nTwilight Sparkle: Flim and Flam are charging for these?\nRarity: Well, they have to cover expenses, and Flam insists that everything extra goes to improving the school and\u2014\n[beat]\nRarity: This is the scam, isn't it?\nTwilight Sparkle: Let's find out.\n\nStar Swirl the Bearded: These lessons are so valuable. Are you sure I can't give you more?\nFlam: Ah-ah-ah! Unnecessary! Being able to share them with a pony like you is our real reward. [to Destitute Pony] Oh, my. And you want to study alongside Star Swirl, hmm?\nDestitute Pony: It's all I have.\n[paper rips]\nFlim: Come back for the rest when you can afford it.\nDestitute Pony: W-Wait! I'll sell the shirt off my back!\nFlam: And that's the kind of determination that'll get you to the next level, student whose... name I know!\nRarity: [whispering] Twilight, maybe I should take over the investigation. Think of your reputation!\nTwilight Sparkle: My reputation isn't worth much if I won't risk it for what I think is right. Besides, I have a plan.\n\n[door opens]\n[door closes]\n[door opens]\n[cranking sounds]\n[door slams]\n\n[door opens]\n[bits jingling]\nFlim: Well, brother of mine, we've got almost all the bits we need to expand our resort. If we add another level of classes and worksheets, we'll be there.\nFlam: Maybe we should add two levels, just to be safe.\n[beep!]\n[powering-up sounds]\n[water running]\nFlim: [sighs] It's a thing of beauty. But I was thinking. What if we added another extreme pool slide here?\nFlam: Mmmm... Sure, as long as the pipes for the musical chocolate fountain go through... here.\nTwilight Sparkle: But shouldn't it go closer to the pudding hot tub here?\nFlim: Fair point, but\u2014 What?!\nTwilight Sparkle: I knew your school was a scam!\nFlim: Well, well, well, if it isn't the Princess of Jealousy. I guess we'll be going to the papers after all.\nTwilight Sparkle: And I suppose I'll just lead your students into this secret room of bits and resort expansion plans!\nFlam: Uhhhh... l-let's not get hasty. You have something on us. We have something on you. Let's just call it even.\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't think so. You can destroy my reputation if you want, but using your students' bits to expand your resort is wrong, even if the lessons you teach are good ones.\nFlam: Of course they're good. We copied them from your book.\nFlim: We just skipped every other page. All the lessons, half the time!\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans] Fine. If you really want to call it even, give back the bits and stop charging for my lessons. Then you can teach them as much as you like.\nFlim and Flam: Nah!\nFlim: Running a school is more work than we thought. Besides, we almost have everything we need.\n[zip!]\nRarity: I think not!\nFlam: Plainity? My star pupil?\nRarity: [affected voice] Not Plainity, but... [normal voice] Rarity!\n[beat]\nFlim: Who?\nRarity: We decided to bring somepony else here to listen to everything you just said!\nFlim: [stutters] Hey, Star Swirl. We were just about to\u2014\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Return the bits you've collected from your students and close your school?\nFlam: [gulps] Yeah. That.\n\n[bits jingling]\nStar Swirl the Bearded: [sighs] It seems I'll never stop learning from your example, Twilight. It is a valuable lesson to stand up for what you know is true. I wish I had known it, too.\nStudent 4: Thanks for returning our bits. But how are we going to learn about friendship now?\n[disappointed murmuring]\nStar Swirl the Bearded: Well, I can refer you to a fairly reputable establishment just outside of Ponyville. I'm quite certain the headmare would consider letting you in.\nTwilight Sparkle: [giggles]\n[students cheering]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [reading] \"Of course, if I ever go to a school again, I'll make sure it's yours. In friendship, Star Swirl.\"\nRarity: I still don't understand how Flim and Flam could have gotten a copy of your book.\n[door opens]\nCozy Glow: Uh, I finished straightening up in the library. Professor Rarity, I just wanted to make sure you're definitely keeping these.\nRarity: But of course, darling. If there's one thing I learned at Friendship University, it is not to give up when you know what's right. And I know teaching friendship through sewing is right! I just need to figure out how.\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[school bell rings]\n[door opens]\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh! Rarity! Just the pony I'm looking for! Can you come to Twilight's class with me? It won't take long.\nRarity: Oh, I'd love to help, but I have to meet Rainbow Dash for our day of fun together.\nStarlight Glimmer: Twilight wants to use you as an example for the students.\nRarity: Ooh!\n\n[door opens]\nRarity: Your example is here! [laughs] Oh!\nRainbow Dash: I thought I was the example.\nTwilight Sparkle: You both are. Because together, you perfectly demonstrate my lesson on compromise in friendship. Rainbow Dash and Rarity have very different interests that keep them busy. But being friends is so important to them, they always manage to make time for each other.\nRarity: [laughs nervously] Our day of fun was hard to plan, what with Rainbow Dash's extremely time-consuming and erratically scheduled Wonderbolts practice.\nRainbow Dash: And Rarity's weird fashion seasons. She's working on her winter collection, and it's not even summer yet!\nTwilight Sparkle: But you still found time to be together, and that's what counts. See, class? These ponies are models of true friendship in action.\n[pencils scribbling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks for stopping by! Enjoy your day of fun!\nSilverstream: Ooh! Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! What amazing stuff are you gonna do together?!\n\n\n\n\nRarity:\nShoe shopping!\nDress shopping!\nFabric dyeing!\n\n\nRainbow Dash:\nObstacle races!\nBuckball!\nFlight goggle shopping!\n\n\nRarity:\nShoe shopping!\nDress shopping!\nFabric dyeing!\n\nRainbow Dash:\nObstacle races!\nBuckball!\nFlight goggle shopping!\n\nRainbow Dash: Aw, come on! I even said \"shopping\" that time!\nRarity: Perfect! We'll go shopping first.\nRainbow Dash: But I brought stuff for buckball to\u2014\nSmolder: Are we supposed to be learning something here? 'Cause this doesn't sound like compromising at all.\nGallus: Yeah, you guys have nothing in common. How can you be friends?\nRainbow Dash and Rarity: [laughing nervously]\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Even though Rainbow Dash and Rarity enjoy doing different things, there are plenty of reasons why they're friends.\nYona: Uh, like what?\nRainbow Dash: [scoffs] We've always been friends.\nOcellus: Always?\nRainbow Dash: Well, no. Not always. But for like a super long time.\nRarity: And we know all the same ponies.\nSmolder: Um, is that it?\nRainbow Dash: Uh, there was that time during the Cloudsdale Best Young Flyer Competition that I totally saved Rarity's life.\nRarity: Yes! And I once proved Rainbow Dash's innocence to her beloved Wonderbolts when she was being framed for a mysterious incident.\nSandbar: Cool! What else?\nRainbow Dash, Rarity, and Twilight Sparkle: [laugh nervously]\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, look. It may seem like Rarity and Rainbow Dash don't have that much in common when you try to put it into words, but sometimes friendships can't be explained. You just have to see them in action to understand.\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, that's a great idea!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Just go about your day of fun as you normally would. You won't even know we're here!\nRainbow Dash: [singsongy] Game on!\n[sports theme]\n[thwacking]\nRainbow Dash: Rarity! You were supposed to be holding your bucket!\nRarity: Hmm? Oh! Sorry, darling. Wearing this drab jersey gave me an idea for a buckball-inspired line of \"athleisure\" wear that would allow for maximum flexibility and style! Uh, but I'm ready now! [blink, blink]\nRainbow Dash: Good! 'Cause this time, I'm gonna try something new and super-intense!\n[sports theme continues]\n[thwacking]\n[whirr!]\n[zoom!]\nRainbow Dash: Rarity! Are you even paying attention?!\nRarity: What? Oh! I mean, of course! Uh, I held my bucket and everything!\nRainbow Dash: But you have to catch the ball!\nRarity: Really? Well, that sounds dangerous.\nRainbow Dash: [quietly, to herself] Oh, forget it. She's never gonna understand the point of this game. [out loud] Buckball time is over!\nRarity: [sighs] Finally!\nTwilight Sparkle: Uhhh, see? They did something Rainbow Dash likes, so now it's time for something Rarity likes. Compromise!\n\nRarity: Hmmm... I'm genuinely not sure. Are they too in style?\nRainbow Dash: Uh, isn't that what you want them to be?\nRarity: Oh, yes, yes. But they should be ahead of the curve. If they're in fashion right now, then they're practically already out.\nRainbow Dash: That doesn't make any sense.\nRarity: Hmmm... Perhaps I should get the stilettos instead. What do you think?\nRainbow Dash: [scoffs] Unless you like tripping with every step, heels on a horse are pretty useless.\nRarity: [nickers] Au contraire. They're perfect in a multitude of situations. Formal functions, afternoon teas, evening teas, high tea, tea by the sea, royal tea\u2014\nRainbow Dash: Can they clean up glitter? Ew! It's on my hooves! Are we done yet?! [groans] This is sooooo boring!\nTwilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash and Rarity are just, uh, showcasing an aspect of friendship called \"banter\", the playful and friendly exchange of remarks. [laughs nervously] It's all in good fun.\n[pencils scribbling]\n\nRarity: Ooh, I cannot wait! Collecting gemstones is my favorite!\nRainbow Dash: Finally, something we can agree on! Treasure hunting!\nRarity and Rainbow Dash: [laugh, hoof-bump]\nTwilight Sparkle: See, everycreature? That didn't take long. Now they're having a great time together.\n[pencils scribbling]\nRarity: Ooh! Magnifique! This will be perfect for the emerald-encrusted romper I've been working on!\nRainbow Dash: Cool! Now, what would be even cooler is if we could find a treasure chamber or something! Now, if I were a secret door, where would I be?\n[knocking]\n[crack]\n[thud]\nRarity: Ugh, Rainbow Dash! Could you please refrain from all of that racket? It's muddying my concentration.\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] Look! A lever! [grunts] It's stuck! Come help me, Rarity!\nRarity: [sighs] Just a moment.\n[thumping]\nRainbow Dash: [grunting]\n[crash!]\n[shatters]\nRarity: [gasps] You ruined my gems!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, well, you ruined my treasure hunt!\nRarity: Ugh! This wasn't about treasure! It was about finding gemstones for my winter collection!\nRainbow Dash: Who cares about clothes?! We're supposed to be on an adventure together!\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh-oh.\nRarity: That... is... it! This \"day of fun\" is officially over!\nRainbow Dash: Fine by me! Maybe I can spend some time doing something I actually like now!\nYoung Six: [gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: [laughs nervously] Surely, you don't mean that. You're just having a little disagreement. [to students] Sometimes that happens between pals. But no matter what, they can always get past the problem and stay good friends.\nRainbow Dash: I don't think we can. [to Rarity] You don't care about any of the things I like! It's always about you and your boring fashions!\nRarity: Oh, puh-lease! You don't even give my interests a chance! You have absolutely no respect for the finer things! No respect, I tell you!\n\n\n\n\nRarity:\nI suppose we're just not friends anymore!\n\n\nRainbow Dash:\nI guess we're just not friends anymore!\n\n\nRarity:\nI suppose we're just not friends anymore!\n\nRainbow Dash:\nI guess we're just not friends anymore!\n\nStudents: [gasp]\n[pencils scribbling]\n\nRarity: ...And then there was the time Rainbow Dash called my Cloudsdale Couture Boutique idea \"impractical\"! Imagine that! Just because I needed Twilight to perform the butterfly wing spell on me whenever I wanted to deliver merchandise!\nRainbow Dash: ...And I told her a thousand times Pegasi don't even want restrictive heavy dresses! We need to be able to fly! Duh!\nRarity: Not to mention the day I was wearing a really gorgeous hat, and Rainbow Dash didn't even notice!\nRainbow Dash: The Wonderbolts show was ruined! Rarity's hat was blocking everypony's view!\nRainbow Dash and Rarity: [snarl]\nStarlight Glimmer: Enough! Guidance counseling is for talking out your problems, not telling me everything that's ever happened in the history of Equestria! [groans] But I've learned sometimes talking isn't enough. You need to put yourselves in one another's shoes.\nRainbow Dash: No way am I wearing those!\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans] What I'm saying is we need a way to help you two reconnect. Follow me!\n[doors open]\n\nRainbow Dash: The library? And this helps us how?\nStarlight Glimmer: You both love books. Rainbow Dash never stops talking about Daring Do adventures, and you're a huge fan of Shadow Spade mysteries.\nRarity: Your point?\nStarlight Glimmer: The perfect way for you two to reconnect as friends is to read each other's favorite book. I'll read them, too. Then we'll all discuss afterward. It'll be a \"Good Friends Book Club\". Okay? I'll bring snacks.\nRainbow Dash: Ugh! Fine!\nRarity: If you insist.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Great! We're all here! To start, why don't you two share one thing you liked about each other's books?\n[beat]\nStarlight Glimmer: Okay. I'll go first. Uh, I really enjoy the part in Daring Do and the Razor of Dreams when Daring used a vicious cragadile as a raft, and then\u2014\nRarity: [giggles] Please.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, what's so funny?\nRarity: Oh, sorry. It's just that I find those action sequences so ridiculously over-the-top.\nRainbow Dash: But they're real! You even met Daring Do!\nRarity: Yes, but the book's descriptions just drag on, and what about those silly unpronounceable names? Doctor whozit-whatsit... [Spanish pronunciation] Caballeron?\nRainbow Dash: Ca-ba-ller-on! Just like it looks! How hard is that?! [snarls]\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, tea, anypony? Cucumber sandwich? [laughs nervously] Or we could go over some nice friendly talking points.\nRainbow Dash: [scoffs] Seriously?! Don't even get me started on those clothing descriptions in Shadow Spade! What a yawn fest!\nRarity: [stutters] But... the outfit descriptions are an integral part of the plot of The Colt in Crimson: A Shadow Spade Mystery!\nRainbow Dash: [insincere yawning]\nRarity: You see, if you didn't know that Sir Fluffingsworth von Radishfield wears only silk, double-breasted waistcoats, you'd never deduce that he, in fact, was the culprit!\nRainbow Dash: W-Wait. He was?\nRarity: [gasps] You didn't even read it!\nStarlight Glimmer: [quietly, to herself] I can see I'm gonna need reinforcements.\n[teleportation zap]\nRainbow Dash: Not my fault it's so boring and put me to sleep!\nRarity: If you can't be bothered to read the thing I like, that just further illustrates the point that we have nothing in common anymore!\nCherry Fizzy, Savoir Fare, Rose, Lyra Heartstrings, Sweetie Drops: [collective gasp]\nRainbow Dash: At least we agree on that! From now on, I'm only hanging out with ponies who get me!\nCherry Fizzy, Savoir Fare, Rose, Lyra Heartstrings, Sweetie Drops: [deeper collective gasp]\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Your drama can wait! Twilight needs help! Now!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [panicking noises]\nStarlight Glimmer: [panting] Any luck?\nTwilight Sparkle: No! It's goooone!\nRainbow Dash: What's gone?\nTwilight Sparkle: The Amulet of Aurora!\nRarity: [gasps] One of the magical items you've been keeping for Princess Celestia?\nTwilight Sparkle: That amulet can reverse the tides and summon tsunamis! If it falls into the wrong hooves, Equestria will be in grave danger!\nRainbow Dash: Don't worry, Twilight! I know tons about searching for lost treasure!\nRarity: And if I follow the culprit's clues, I'm certain I can find who took your amulet!\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you! I'll feel so much better knowing you two are looking for it together!\nStarlight Glimmer: While we work on a locator spell. It's the perfect solution!\n[closet doors open]\nRarity: There appear to be no signs of damage to the surrounding artifacts, suggesting the thief did not leave in a hurry.\n[clattering]\nRainbow Dash: Rarity, your boots are leaving sparkles all over the floor!\nRarity: Pfft! Those aren't from my boots. Mine are magenta, not blue. See?\nRainbow Dash: [gasps]\nRarity: I mean, really!\n\n[doors open]\nRarity: [panting] Turns out these boots were not \"made for trotting,\" as advertised. Where are you going?! We promised Twilight we'd work together!\nRainbow Dash: Don't you see? The Amulet of Aurora is made out of Azurantium!\n[beat]\nRainbow Dash: Azurantium? You know! The same metal that the Amulet of Atonement from Daring Do book four is made from? It always leaves sparkles wherever it goes. Just like this, remember? It's from the book you just read!\nRarity: [laughs nervously] That book! Yes! The one I-I just... just read! Ha-ha-ha!\nRainbow Dash: Seriously?! After giving me all that grief, you didn't read mine either?!\nRarity: Oopsie?\nRainbow Dash: [groans] As soon as we find this amulet, we are done with each other!\nRarity: Fine by me!\n\nRarity: [panting] Ooh! Rainbow Dash, slow down! You're flying past important clues! Look, it's a print. But definitely not a hoof. Are those claw marks?\nRainbow Dash: Who cares? I found a bigger clue!\n[geyser spewing]\nRarity: I hope you don't expect me to... [shudders] ...wade through that.\n[submerging]\n[plop]\nRainbow Dash: Nah. It's too deep. We'll get stuck.\nRarity: Ooh. Clever. What Daring Do book did you get that from?\nRainbow Dash: Actually, I learned it at Scootaloo's Filly Guides camp.\nRarity: [sighs] At least you can fly across.\n[geysers spewing]\nRainbow Dash: [gasps, grunts] Nope. If one of those geysers burns off my wing feathers, I'll be out of the Wonderbolts for weeks. [groans] I could...\n[construction sounds under]\nRainbow Dash: ...try and slingshot my way through. But I'd need two perfectly placed trees, some stretchy rope, and a pith helmet. [groans] Too bad we can't do what Daring Do did in book four and find a cragadile for a raft.\nRarity: Ta-daaa! The S.S. Cragadile, at your service!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, that... is... awesome! Uh, I mean, it's all right, I guess.\n[dragging sounds]\nRainbow Dash: How did you know how to do that?\nRarity: Mmm. We may have been friends for a super-long time, but you don't know everything about me yet.\n[splashing]\n[wings revving]\n[geysers spewing]\n\nRarity: [gasps] The glitter trail! It's gone!\nRainbow Dash: How are we supposed to find the Amulet of Aurora now?\n[leaves rustling]\nBufogren: [croaks]\nRarity: [screams]\nBufogren: [quietly] Owww. Ears. Why hoof-hoofs yell? Too, too loud.\nRarity: [loudly] Sorry! What did you say?!\nBufogren: [quietly] Too, too loud.\nRainbow Dash: I think it's a Bufogren. They have really sensitive ears. [whispering loudly] Did you happen to see anycreature with a sparkly thingy go this way?\nBufogren: Saw it.\nRainbow Dash and Rarity: [gagging]\nRainbow Dash: Hold that thought! [gasping]\nRarity: [coughing]\nRainbow Dash: His breath smells so bad, I can't think! But we can't hear him from back here. Now what?\nRarity: Hmmm... [sniffs] Aha! I think I have the perfect solution. An old unicorn beauty trick. That is, if you can somehow procure us a tiny bit of cloud?\nRainbow Dash: Now that I can do!\n[geyser spewing]\n[spinning]\nRarity: Ooh! It's adorable! [nose pinched] Um, excuse me, kind sir. I have a special treat for you in exchange for your information.\nBufogren: Ooh... What's that?\nRarity: [nose pinched] It is a magical unicorn delicacy called \"Effervescence\". Very now. Very chic. [yells]\nBufogren: Owww!\nRarity: Sorry, sorry. Enjoy.\nBufogren: Mmmmm.... My mouth. Fresh and minty. [nomming]\nRarity: [sniffs, sighs]  Good. Uh, now, which way did the sparkly thing go?\nBufogren: Up-up. Up there.\nRarity: Thank you! [to Rainbow Dash] Well, what are you waiting for? Go on! Fly up there and get that amulet!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, we're doing this together, remember?\nRarity: But how can we\u2014 [screams, panicky noises, panting]\nRainbow Dash: Sorry, but I wasn't leaving you behind in that swamp.\nRarity: [exhales] Thank you.\n[door jiggles]\n[knocking]\nRainbow Dash: Huh. Maybe the key to unlocking this thing is in these inscriptions.\nRarity: Or perhaps the key is right here!\n[click]\nRarity: I couldn't decide between the boots and the stilettos, so I got both!\n[lock unlatching]\n[door opens]\nRainbow Dash: High heels could do that?\nRarity: And you called them \"useless\".\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] I shouldn't have said that. Or made fun of the other stuff you like to do. Some of it's actually sorta neat.\nRarity: I... owe you an apology, too. Buckball may not be my thing, but it's something you enjoy. And you're very good at it. I never should've treated your interests like they were worth less than mine.\nRainbow Dash: Soooo... does this mean we're still friends?\nRarity: I would very much like that. Now let's go find that amulet!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! [laughs]\n\n[door opens]\nRainbow Dash: Wait! That tunnel leads to the... school? A secret passage! Awesome!\nRarity: [gasps] Spikey-wikey! You stole the Amulet of Aurora?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Not exactly.\nRarity: You mean, this was a setup to make us get along?\nStarlight Glimmer: Sorry to interfere, but you both...\nRainbow Dash: ...reeeeeally needed it.\nRainbow Dash and Rarity: [laugh]\nSmolder: So even though you don't like any of the same stuff, you two are friends again?\nRarity: Heh. Always. I think we just needed a teensy reminder.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah. We don't have to love the exact same things to have fun together. I mean, imagine if we did! How boring would that be?\nRarity: When we give each other a chance to share the different things we enjoy, it can be surprisingly wonderful! [sighs] Too bad we wasted our day of fun.\nRainbow Dash: We still have a little time left. You wanna... go hit the shops? I could actually use your help picking out some new buckball gear.\nRarity: Do I?! But only if you help me choose some buckball fan attire, so I can cheer for my favorite player at the drop of a fabulous hat!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, yeah! Let's go already!\nRainbow Dash and Rarity: [laugh, happy chatter]\nTwilight Sparkle: [to students] See? Good friends always work through their differences.\nStarlight Glimmer: [laughs] Even if it takes a little help.\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[birds tweeting]\n[rustling]\n[honk!]\n[birds fluttering]\nFluttershy: Huh?

If anything, she's gotten worse!\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, maybe we can just pretend she's really good, and then I'll find a spell that will\u2014\nApplejack: Oh, no, no, no! We're not goin' through that again! Remember how well it worked out when you weren't honest with Celestia about her actin' ability?\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans] You're right. We'll just have to tell Pinkie Pie she's not very good at the yovidaphone.\n[yovidaphone plays]\n[ponies screaming]\nRarity: Well, there's no time like the present.\n[music stops]\nPinkie Pie: Phew! Huh, that's weird. I coulda sworn this place was packed a second ago. Hey, guys! Can I favor you all with a tune? I take requests!\nApplejack: Actually, we do have a request, and yeah, it involves your yovidaphone.\nPinkie Pie: You mean the thing I love more than anything else in Equestria? My sun, my moon, my stars, my everything? Ooh! Tell me, tell me, tell me!\nApplejack: All right. In all honesty... Uh, in all honesty... Rarity has somethin' to say!\nRarity: Pinkie, please listen to Rainbow Dash.\nRainbow Dash: Ugh, fine! So, Pinkie, remember when we all were shocked to discover Princess Celestia wasn't so good at acting?\nPinkie Pie: Yeah, she was awful! But that's kind of a random thing to bring up. I thought you wanted to talk about my yovidaphone playing.\nRainbow Dash: Well, it's, uh... It's just... You need to know, uh... Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Pinkie, we all support you, but we're afraid you're just not good at the yovidaphone, and none of us want you to waste your time on something you can't do well.\nPinkie Pie: Oh. [upbeat] Why didn't you just say so?\n[air deflating]\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] We were all really nervous to tell you.\nPinkie Pie: Why? It's just a silly instrument. Well, lunch break's over. Gotta get back to the bakery. Those apple turnovers aren't gonna apple themselves! [whistles gleefully] No more yovidaphone playing for me-e-e!\n[door closes]\nFluttershy: Wow. She took that so much better than I thought.\n\n[trash can creaking]\n[honk!]\nPinkie Pie: [sadly] No more yovidaphone playing for me. And a-one, and a-two, and I don't know what to do. [crying]\n\n[indistinct conversations]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Another beautiful day in Ponyville.\nSpike: Uh, Twilight, when was the last time you saw Pinkie Pie?\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmmm, not since we told her to stop playing the yovidaphone. I'm still surprised with how well she took it.\nSpike: I don't think she took it as well as you think she took it.\nDaisy: Top of the morning to ya!\nPinkie Pie: Is it morning? I hadn't noticed.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's not good.\nRainbow Dash: There you are! We've been looking all over for you!\nRarity: It turns out Pinkie may not have taken our critique of her yovidaphone playing in the spirit with which it was intended.\nTwilight Sparkle: I saw.\n[shriveling]\n[shade closing]\nSpike: There's gotta be something we can do.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sure there is, Spike. We just have to figure out what.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] I don't get it. So she's no good at playing the yovidaphone. What's the big deal? There are so many other things she's really good at doing.\nApplejack: Yeah! Not bein' able to play the yovidaphone is nothin' compared to all the things she can do well.\nTwilight Sparkle: And that's exactly what we'll show her! I bet if we get her to do the stuff she likes and is good at doing, she'll cheer right back up and forget all about the yovidaphone.\nApplejack: Hoo-whee! That's a great idea!\n[air squeaks, hisses]\nRarity: Let's get started. Apparently, there's not a moment to lose.\n\n[music]\n[tea pouring]\n[clink]\n[animals chittering]\nFluttershy: [slurps]\n[bubbling]\n[thud]\n\n[weak party cannon squeak]\n[party cannon squeak]\nPinkie Pie: [sighs]\n[air hissing]\n\nRainbow Dash: [laughs, groans]\n\n[spraying and popping]\nPinkie Pie: [sneezes]\n[mirror shattering]\n\nApplejack, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Fluttershy: [sigh]\nTwilight Sparkle: So, I'm guessing nopony had any success?\nApplejack: [sighs] My party cannon idea was a real dud.\nRainbow Dash: Don't blame yourself. None of us did any better.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, not to worry. I came up with the perfect solution. Instead of trying to remind her what she's good at, we'll remind her what she's best at. And that's being our friend. We're gonna throw her a Pinkie Pie Appreciation Party!\nFluttershy: That's a wonderful idea! If anypony needs to know how much she's appreciated, it's Pinkie Pie.\nRainbow Dash: We can get the whole town involved, just so she can see what a good friend she is to everypony.\nTwilight Sparkle: Then I hereby officially declare today Pinkie Pie Appreciation Day!\nRest of the Mane Six: [cheer]\n\n[various party noises]\nRarity: Now this is perfection!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! If anything could help Pinkie Pie cheer up and make her forget about her yovidaphone, this is definitely it!\nApplejack: Sure is! Okay, who's gonna get her?\nTwilight Sparkle: No need. Gummy's on it. In fact, there he is now!\n[dragging noise]\n[thump]\n[beat]\nApplejack: Uh, Gummy? You were supposed to bring Pinkie Pie. What happened?\nGummy: [blinks slowly]\nRarity: Is she still coming?\n[beat]\nTwilight Sparkle: Fluttershy, can you understand what he's saying?\nFluttershy: I could... if he was talking.\nSpike: Let me try something. [slowly, loudly, and deliberately] Gummy! Where is Pinkie Pie?!\n[splat]\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe we should just go and get her.\n\n[magic zap]\n[party horn]\nApplejack: What in tarnation is goin' on here?!\nRarity: This decor is dreadful.\nRainbow Dash: And all of Pinkie's stuff is... gone?!\nRarity: It is a puzzle.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Excuse me.\nRarity: Oh, yes, of course.\nTwilight Sparkle: Um, Maud? Can I ask you a question?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] You just did.\nApplejack: Well, can I ask you a question?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] You just did.\nRainbow Dash: [groans] Fine! How about if I ask you a\u2014 Wait.\nRarity: Oh, for goodness' sakes! Maud. All of your sister's things are gone. Explain.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] No, they're not. They're right here.\nFluttershy: Have you seen Pinkie Pie?\nMaud Pie: Lots of times. I grew up with her.\n[cart rumbling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, let's try this a different way. Why did you pack up all of Pinkie's things?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] She asked me to.\nRest of the Mane Six: What?!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Pinkie told me to pack up her room and take everything to the rock farm.\nRest of the Mane Six: What?!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] She said she wouldn't need them since she's moving to Yakyakistan.\nRest of the Mane Six: What?!\n\nRarity: Terribly sorry, Maud. Must've misheard you. It almost sounded like you said Pinkie's [chuckling] moved to Yakyakistan!\nApplejack: Uh, Rarity? She did say that.\nRarity: Uh, terribly sorry, Applejack. Must've misheard you. It almost sounded like you said [chuckling] she did say that!\nTwilight Sparkle: Maud, I don't understand. Why would Pinkie leave Ponyville?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah! Why would she want to go live with the yaks?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] She said without the yovidaphone, her life had no meaning, and at least in Yakyakistan, she could listen to the masters play. She hoped that would give her some semblance of happiness.\nRarity: Well, no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no! That will not do!\nApplejack: I say we go to Yakyakistan right now and make her come back home!\nTwilight Sparkle: We can't just march up there and tell Pinkie what to do.\nFluttershy: [tearing up] But... we didn't even get a chance to say goodbye!\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, we may not be able to go to Yakyakistan and force her to come home, but we could go say goodbye... and if we happen to mention how much her friendship means to us, and how much we'd miss her if she were gone forever, and then she decided to come back home on her own...\nRainbow Dash: Then what are we waiting around here for?! Let's get going to Yakyakistan!\nRest of the Mane Six: [cheering]\n\nRest of the Mane Six: [various yelps and whoas]\nTwilight Sparkle: We're almost there.\n\nApplejack: Pinkie's gotta be around here somewhere.\nFluttershy: But where?\n[distant yovidaphone playing]\nRarity: Is that...?\nTwilight Sparkle: The music of the yovidaphone.\nRainbow Dash: Are you sure? Because that actually sounds kinda... good.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, I'm sure. Come on.\n\n[yovidaphone playing]\nRainbow Dash: Huh. Not what I expected.\nYaks: Shhhh!\nRainbow Dash: Oh, sorry.\nYaks: Shhhhhhh!\nRainbow Dash: [hushed] I said I was sorry!\nFluttershy: [hushed, gasps] There she is!\nPinkie Pie: [gulps] [despondent] Gimme another.\nYak waiter: But pony already had twenty-five ice\u2014\nPinkie Pie: I said, gimme another!\nTwilight Sparkle: [grunts] Pardon me!\nApplejack: Excuse us.\nRainbow Dash: Oh, uh, sorry!\nPinkie Pie: [despondent] I feel nothing.\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe we can help with that.\nPinkie Pie: [despondent] Oh. Hey. What are you guys doing here?\nApplejack: Just hear us out.\nRainbow Dash: We respect your decision to move to Yakyakistan.\nTwilight Sparkle: But we just wanted to remind you how much you mean to us, and how much we'd miss you if you decided to move here for\u2014\nPinkie Pie: [despondent] Fine. I'll move back to Ponyville.\nRainbow Dash: Wow. That was a lot easier than I thought. We're awesome!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie, what's wrong?\nPinkie Pie: [despondent] That's what's wrong. I thought coming here and listening to real yovidaphone playing would make me happy.\n[yaks applauding]\nPinkie Pie: [despondent] It makes me feel worse. I'm never gonna sound like that.\nYigrid: Yovidaphone fan pony watch instrument while Yigrid visit little yak's room?\nPinkie Pie: [despondent] Eh. If I can't play it, I might as well do menial chores for those who can.\nApplejack: Okay, so Pinkie Pie is obviously still miserable.\nFluttershy: Oh, I can't bear to see her like this.\n[yovidaphone honks]\nRarity: Indeed. But what else can we do?\n[yovidaphone honks]\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, we've tried everything!\nFluttershy: Maybe not. Look!\n[yovidaphone honking]\nPinkie Pie: [stifled giggling] Whoops! Sorry!\n[yovidaphone honking]\nPinkie Pie: I forgot what an awful yovidaphoner I am.\nTwilight Sparkle: Playing it makes you so happy.\nPinkie Pie: [wistfully] [sighs] It sure does. I mean... it did.\nTwilight Sparkle: Then you should never stop.\nRarity: So say we all!\nFluttershy and Rainbow Dash, under: [sounds of agreement]\nApplejack: Absolutely.\nPinkie Pie: But... you were the ones who told me to stop because I wasn't good.\nTwilight Sparkle: And we were wrong.\nFluttershy: Playing makes you happy.\nRarity: And as long as it makes you happy, it doesn't matter how good you are!\nApplejack: So get up there and show these yaks how it's done!\nPinkie Pie: [stage whisper] I don't know if you've noticed, but the audience are all yaks, and they kind of have \"issues\" with things that aren't perfect! Like my playing!\nRainbow Dash: Pinkie Pie, you get up on that stage and play. If these yaks don't like it, they'll have to answer to us!\nPinkie Pie: Well, okay... If you all say so...\nRainbow Dash: [clears throat] Ladies and gentleyaks! Performing for her very first time here, let's give a big round of stomps for... Pinkie Pie!\nPinkie Pie: [clears throat] Um, hi! So, uh, any yaks here from out of town?\n[yak snorts]\nPinkie Pie: Ooookay. And a-one, and a-two, and I-kinda-remember-what-to-do... [inhales]\n[discordant yovidaphone playing]\nTwilight Sparkle: [grunts]\n[chicken squawks]\nPinkie Pie: [gasps for breath]\n[beat]\n[yaks cheering]\nPinkie Pie: Uhhh, I kinda wasn't expecting this.\nRainbow Dash: Me, neither.\nYigrid: [stomps] Oh, pony play good set!\nPinkie Pie: You think so? Even though it wasn't perfect?\nYigrid: Yovidaphone is instrument of happiness. Playing yovidaphone make pony happy. Pony playing is perfect!\nPinkie Pie: Well if that's the case, lemme play you the song I just wrote two seconds ago! It's called \"I've Got the Best Most Supportive Friends a Pony Could Ever Ask For\"!

You shoulda oughta tell a pony before ya go a-poofin' 'em around the stage!\n[crowd cheers]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Trixie, that was an amazing show!\nPrincess Cadance: Flurry Heart and I loved it! I'm so glad we decided to come. You two have a real chemistry.\nTrixie: The Terrifying Trunk Escape does require a grrrreat and powerful assistant.\nPrincess Cadance: The way you two work together, it's like you've known each other as long as Twilight and I have.\nStarlight Glimmer: It was pretty fun.\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course it was! There's nothing better than a bond with another pony. You can share all kinds of things.\nTwilight Sparkle and Princess Cadance: Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake!

But \"Ms. Powerful\" has a nice ring.\nHoo'Far: From here to Saddle Arabia, I have seen nothing that compares with your wondrous show. Uh, would you consider blessing my homeland with it?\nTrixie: I was just about to set out on tour. [grunts] But Saddle Arabia is much farther than my usual route. [grunts] Ugh!\n[thud]\nTrixie: [laughs] And, uh, my caravan might not be suited for an extended tour.\nHoo'Far: Mine is new and quite spacious. If it would help persuade you, I would happily trade it for yours.\nTrixie: Trade it?! Heavens, no! This is more than just some great and powerful wagon you see before you! It is shelter. It is transportation. It is my only friend on the long and lonely nights on the road.\nHoo'Far: Very well. Then I must see as many of your performances as I can. If I cannot convince you to bring your tour to Saddle Arabia, I must be prepared to relate its magnificence to your many fans there.\nTrixie: \"Many fans\", you say? [laughs] Well, I suppose I could consider the trip.\nHoo'Far: Wonderful! I look forward to seeing you on the road! And if you change your mind about the caravans, my offer remains open.\nTrixie: Hmmm...\n\nTrixie: It's just so far away. Of course, I love visiting new and exciting places. I am a traveling magician after all.\nStarlight Glimmer: Hmmm. Sounds like your mind's made up.\nTrixie: Not quite. The road is a lonely place. And this trip even more so. I was hoping I might convince my grrrrreat and powerful assistant to come along?\nStarlight Glimmer: Really?\nTrixie: Of course! You're not just my assistant and my counselor. You're also my friend. And what's better than a road trip with friends?\nStarlight Glimmer: Nothing! This will be the best magical road trip ever!\n[doors open]\nStarlight Glimmer: I should probably get somepony to cover my student counseling duties while we're gone.\n\n[clattering]\n[knocking]\nStarlight Glimmer: Trixie, are you all right?\n[door opens]\nTrixie: One caravan for two all set! Oh. You brought luggage. [nervous laugh] I mean, of course you brought luggage!\nStarlight Glimmer: You bet I did! Everything two ponies need for the road trip of their lives! Three one-thousand-piece puzzles, one copy of Dragon Pit \u2013 the best board game in the history of ponies \u2013 my famous collection of campfire spices, and an inflatable raft. Did I forget something? I could pop back to the castle and grab it.\nTrixie: Oh, no. It isn't that.\nStarlight Glimmer: Yeah, maybe we don't need the raft.\n\nTrixie: [sighs] We just needed a little great and powerful rrrrreorganization! [struggling] Now, everything... fits.. just... fine!\n[crash]\nTrixie: [sighs] Who am I kidding? My wagon is too small for us. I understand if you're having second thoughts.\nStarlight Glimmer: Second thoughts? [scoffs] Are you kidding? This wagon isn't small. It's... eh... cozy. And there's no such thing as too cozy.\nTrixie: Well, all right then! I guess it's time to hit the road!

The two of us sleeping in that cozy caravan could get tricky.\nStarlight Glimmer: Trixie, there's plenty of high-quality inns to stay at on the way. Don't worry about it. I'm not backing out of the greatest and most powerful road trip bonding experience two ponies could ever have.\nTrixie: Well, when you put it like that, I'm actually kind of excited!\nStarlight Glimmer: Me, too!

I always buy my haycakes here.\nStarlight Glimmer: So we're just going to wait in line for hours? Uh, which is totally cool! Waiting-in-line bonding! Right?\n\nTrixie: After our falafel purchase, we weren't able to get everything on my list. But we are definitely set for breakfast.\nStarlight Glimmer: And I'm sure we'll find out that waiting in that super-long line was worth it.\nTrixie: A few hiccups always happen. We'll be back on the road to friendship after a good night's sleep.\nMrs. Trotsworth: We're all full!\nStarlight Glimmer and Trixie: [gasp]\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, I'm sure we'll find something.\n\nTall Pony: Nope.\n[door closes]\n\nShort Pony: Sorry.\n[curtain draws]\n\nRound Pony: All full!\n[door closes]\n\nHoo'Far: Ah, the Glowpaz Festival. Somnambula is no doubt filled to the brim.

Ya might've thought to make a reservation!\nStarlight Glimmer: Um, I've been with you singing and standing in line. When would I have done that?\nTrixie: I don't know. But I'm starting to think you aren't as great and powerful an assistant as I thought!\nStarlight Glimmer: So you just brought me along to do your legwork?\nTrixie: [sighs] No. Of course not. I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated. I was really looking forward to a relaxing night in a nice room.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] Me, too. But since there's literally no room at the inns, I guess it's lucky we've got the wagon.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: [unenthusiastically] Sleeping-in-tight-quarters bonding.\nStarlight Glimmer and Trixie: [unenthusiastically] Yaaaaay.\n[bumping]\nStarlight Glimmer: [grunting, groans]\nTrixie: Is there something I can do to make things more comfortable for you?\nStarlight Glimmer: You could get rid of this junk.\n[clattering]\nTrixie: Yes, well, before we throw away the magical items it's taken me years to collect, we could try switching hammocks.\nStarlight Glimmer: Fine.\n[clang]\n[birds chirping]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: [snoring loudly]\nTrixie: [gasps] Hmm?

I think there's a wild animal outside!\n[thud]\nTrixie: Starlight?\nStarlight Glimmer: [continues snoring]\nTrixie: Starlight!\nStarlight Glimmer: [startled noises] What?\nTrixie: I'm sorry. Your snoring is a bit, um...\nStarlight Glimmer: Loud? [nervous laugh] Yeah, I do that. I had my village convinced we were being attacked by bears every night.\n[beat]\nStarlight Glimmer: [laughs, clears throat] But we probably need a better solution here.\n\nTrixie: [sleepily muttering] Ladies and gentleponies...

I guess we'll have to resupply.\n[door opens]\nHoo'Far: What a glorious morning! I can't tell you how much I am looking forward to the first show of your tour!\nStarlight Glimmer: Is he gonna be following us for the whole time?!\nTrixie: I do not know.\n\n[crowd murmurs]\nStarlight Glimmer: [flatly] She's been in there a long time. Do you suppose the Terrifying Trunk Escape is too much for a pony who drinks all the juice and talks non-stop in her sleep?! What if the Great and Powerful Trixie can't...\n[poof]\nTrixie: Sleep?! Because her roommate snores like an ursa major?!\n[crowd murmuring]\nStarlight Glimmer: [flatly] But if you're there, who's in here?\n[poof]\n\"Cortland\": There's not much room in here!\nTrixie: At least you don't have to sleep in it with another pony!\n[fanfare]\nHoo'Far: [claps weakly] This show is much better in Ponyville.\n[crowd murmuring]\n\nTrixie: Oh. Would you like the last carrot? I know how fond you are of eating the last of things.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, no. It might make me thirsty, and we don't have anything to drink. So...\nTrixie: The good news is I'm so exhausted, I could sleep through a stampede of wild boars! Which, you'll be delighted to know, is only slightly louder than your snoring.\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, I'm looking forward to rehearsing the act with you all night. So diligent of you to go over it and over it in your sleep.\nTrixie: [through gritted teeth] Practice makes perfect.\nStarlight Glimmer: Not today, it didn't.\nTrixie: Well, I'm sorry you're so miserable!\nStarlight Glimmer: Really?! Because if you wanted to make things more comfortable, you could always pare down a bit!\n[poof]\nTrixie: Well, since you're so concerned about space, you can have it all! I'll sleep under the stars, where at least the wild animals will be QUIETER THAN YOU!\n[door opens]\nHoo'Far: I do not mean to interrupt, but it seems there is trouble on the road to friendship.\nStarlight Glimmer: [derisive laugh] Ya think?!\n[carrot incinerates]\n\nTrixie: [gasps] Where's my wagon?!\n[door opens]\nStarlight Glimmer: I traded it to that pony from Saddle Arabia for his. He even threw in a pair of robes.\n[dramatic sting]\n\nTrixie: You what?!\nStarlight Glimmer: I traded the old, worn-out wagon that was too small for us, for this nice spacious one that we can both enjoy.\nTrixie: [stammering] Who said you could do that?!\nStarlight Glimmer: Nopony. I just did it. [sighs] Now we both have plenty of room, and you didn't even have to give anything away.\nTrixie: Au contraire. I did give something away! I gave away my wagon... and my best friend!\n[clatter]\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't realize you were better friends with that beat-up old wagon than you are with me!\nTrixie: Well, it's easy when the wagon is a better friend! It would've never traded you away!\nStarlight Glimmer: That's ridiculous.\nTrixie: Oh, it is ridiculous. In fact, this whole tour is ridiculous! I don't even know why I invited you in the first place!\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, maybe I should just head home!\nTrixie: I think that's a very good idea! And you can take this horrible giant caravan with you!\nStarlight Glimmer: Fine!\nTrixie: Good!\n\n[dragging]\n[thud]\nTrixie: [grunting] Come on! Whoa!\n[door jiggles]\nHoo'Far: Goodness! Oh, Ms. Powerful. Eh, but where is your assistant? I had hoped providing you with a more comfortable means of conveyance would allow you to once more dazzle the crowds with mystifying feats of magic.\nTrixie: Normally, that sort of flattery would suffice. But today, we must discuss your dishonest and unfair procurement of my wagon!\nHoo'Far: I desired your wagon and provided one of equal and better value in return. It seems like a perfectly honest and fair trade to me.\nTrixie: Unfortunately, it is more nuanced than that!\nHoo'Far: I'm sure it is, but I am eager to set out. If you'll excuse me.\n[whoosh]\nHoo'Far: I am willing to wait as long as you are. [sips]\nTrixie: Ha! We'll just see about that!\n\nHoo'Far: You know, even if I was willing to reverse the trade, you don't have my caravan to offer in return.\nTrixie: [grumbles] Details!\n\n[vines snapping]\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs, grunts]\n[alligator growls]\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: [struggling] You all seemed... a lot less threatening when there were two of us!\n\nStarlight Glimmer: [gasps, yells] This place is awful! How did I not see it before?!\n\n[hawk cries]\n\"Rainy Day\": Hey! It's one of those traveling ponies!\n\"Snow Violet\": Your song really inspired us! We decided we need to head off on the road to friendship, too!\n\"Rainy Day\": It sure beats the road to deliveries!\n\"Snow Violet\": Yeah! Sometimes traveling together is hard!\n\"Rainy Day\": You reminded us we could also make it fun! Thanks again! Woo-hoo!\n\"Rainy Day\" and \"Snow Violet\": [laughing]\n\n[door opens]\nHoo'Far: Steaming hot beverage?\nTrixie: Thank you. No.\n[rumbling]\nStarlight Glimmer: What are you two doing?\nTrixie: Taking a stand! By lying down! Not that you care, Wagon-Trader-Away-er!\nHoo'Far: I'm afraid I'm still not interested, despite your assistant's convenient appearance.\nStarlight Glimmer: Trixie, I came back to apologize. I should never have traded away the wagon. It wasn't mine to trade. It belongs to my friend.\nHoo'Far: Hmmm. If you truly were friends, I suppose I'd be honor-bound to reverse the trade.\nTrixie: Okay! Fine! We're friends! Best friends who share a deep bond who weren't prepared for the emotional challenges of traveling. Happy?!\nHoo'Far: I'm still unconvinced. Perhaps you could prove your friendship.\nTrixie: How?\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, we could do our friendship chant!\n[beat]\nTrixie: Oh, right... Our world-famous chant of friendship that we do all the time because we're such great friends.\nStarlight Glimmer and Trixie: [out of sync] Magic, tra-magic... poof of smoke... want to wave your hooves... and tell a... little joke!\n[poof]\nHoo'Far: [coughs] That was the worst friendship chant I have ever heard! And you two were clearly making it up as you went. But only true friends would be willing to act so ridiculous for one another.\nTrixie: So you'll give back the wagon?\nHoo'Far: Though I'd suggest heading back to Ponyville. I'm not sure Saddle Arabia is ready for... uh, this.\nStarlight Glimmer: That's fair.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm sorry your Saddle Arabian tour was ruined.\nTrixie: Honestly, I don't think I could've stood one more second on the road. At a certain point, I don't even like traveling with myself.\n[door opens]\n[luggage thuds]\nStarlight Glimmer: It is a lot harder than I thought. Still, I'm glad we tried. Mostly so we know not to do it again.\nStarlight Glimmer and Trixie: [laugh]\nTrixie: I think it's made our friendship greater and more powerful than ever!\n\"Cortland\": [grumbles] You know, there's actually plenty of room in here for one pony to nap. Is the show over?\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[bang, bang, bang]\nScootaloo: Order, order, everypony! I hereby call to order this meeting of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club!\n[fans murmuring excitedly]\nScootaloo: First order of business \u2013 [quickly] Let's-celebrate-the-one-and-only-Rainbow-Dash-yay-she's-amazing-now-if-there's-nothing-else-that-concludes-this-meeting-of-the-Rainbow-Dash-Fan-Club-thank-you-all-for-coming-any-questions?!\n[bang]\n[confused murmuring]\nRainbow Dash: Huh?\nScootaloo: Meeting adjourned!\n[door slams]\n[bang, bang]\nScootaloo: I'd like to call to order the first ever meeting of the newest and most exciting club \u2013 of which I am the president, founding, and only member \u2013 the Washouts Fan Club!\nRainbow Dash: [gasps]\n\n[theme song]\n\n[door opens]\nRainbow Dash: Oh, hey, Scootaloo. I was just in the neighbor\u2014 Oh! What's this? Did I interrupt your fan club meeting?\nScootaloo: Hey! What are you doin' here?\nRainbow Dash: I could ask you the same question!\nScootaloo: Oh, uh, y'know... mmm... s-s-stuff. Uh, definitely not starting a new fan club or anything.\nRainbow Dash: Ha! It's no use pretending! I heard everything when I was outside eavesdropping, like I do for every meeting!\nScootaloo: You eavesdrop on every meeting? That's weird.\nRainbow Dash: Well, sure it sounds weird when you say it out loud. And I probably shouldn't because eavesdropping is wrong, but still. Why are you starting a new fan club?\nScootaloo: I just think maybe it's time for me to explore other fan clubs.\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] What is a \"The Washouts\"?\nScootaloo: Only the newest, and greatest, and only stunt troupe in Equestria!\nRainbow Dash: Stunt troupe?\nScootaloo: How can I explain it? Like the Wonderbolts, just twenty bajillion percent cooler! [squee]\nRainbow Dash: \"Twenty bajillion\"?!\nScootaloo: They do all sorts of extreme stunts that focus on daredevilry and sheer guts rather than boring old flight and formation junk.\nRainbow Dash: \"Boring old flight and formation junk\"?!\nScootaloo: Are you just repeating everything I say?\nRainbow Dash: Only because my brain feels like it's strapped to one of those rockets about to explode.\nScootaloo: So you do get it! Aren't they awesome?!\n\nRainbow Dash: Can you believe she actually said that?!\nPinkie Pie: Pfft, well, yeah! Eavesdropping on every meeting is kinda weird.\nRainbow Dash: I mean, she basically said that the Wonderbolts aren't cool! And... And it kinda sounded like she didn't think I was cool either. But, peh, we all know that's crazy! I mean, I'm definitely not worried about her looking up to somepony else. Heh. Nope. Not! At! All!\nApplejack: Well, I'd understand if you were. It'd be like if Apple Bloom started lovin' bananas more than apples. [laughs, sotto voce] Y'all tell me if that ever happens, ya hear?\nRainbow Dash: But what could the Washouts possibly have that I don't?!\nPinkie Pie: Why don't you find out?\nRainbow Dash: They're doing a show in Ponyville this weekend?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Wow! They do look pretty amazing... uh, -ly unamazing. [nervous laugh] Trying so hard to look amazing is what I mean.\nPinkie Pie: Nice save, Twilight! [squee]\n\n[crowd chattering]\nScootaloo: Awww. I knew we shoulda lined up last night.\nPinkie Pie: I'm sorry for making us late. Who would've guessed Xtreme Chocolate Airshow Cupcakes would take an x-tremely long time to bake? [slurps, chomps]\nRainbow Dash: Look at this! It's a total Wonderbolts ripoff!\nScootaloo: What do you mean? The show hasn't even started yet.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, but look at what we're sitting on.\n[bang, bang]\nRainbow Dash: Hello?! The Wonderbolts have bleachers, too! We practically invented sitting on bleachers!\nRarity: Ugh!\nRainbow Dash: And look at that! Popcorn and cotton candy?! Ripoff!\n[feedback]\n[music]\nScootaloo: Huh? Yeeeeeeeaaaahhh!\nAnnouncer: This is the time! This is the place! This is the team! This is... the Washouts!\n[crowd cheers]\n[explosions]\nPinkie Pie: Mmmm! Quality confetti cannon work.\nRainbow Dash: [sighs]\nScootaloo: Oh, yeah!\nAnnouncer: Say it with me now, the Washouts' official motto...\nAnnouncer and Crowd: Leap before you look!\n[crowd cheers]\nScootaloo: Woo-hoo!\nRainbow Dash: Lame.\nFanpony: Oh!\nAnnouncer: Remember, ponies. While they're amazingly awesome, the Washouts are highly trained professionals in protective fire-proof flight suits! Do NOT try this at home!\n[kaboom!]\nRainbow Dash: Whoa. Come on, come on! She's not gonna make it!\n[clang!]\n[crowd gasps]\n[crowd cheers]\nRainbow Dash: That... was... insane! Woo-hoo!\nScootaloo: I told you!\nRainbow Dash: I mean... [clears throat] It was pretty cool. Who are these guys?\n\nScootaloo: I can't just go up and talk to them.\nRainbow Dash: You can if you're with me. After all, one of the reasons there's a Rainbow Dash fan club is because I'm fearless. Observe.\n[water splashing]\nRainbow Dash: Hey!\n[beat]\nRainbow Dash: Uh, so as a fellow aerobatic professional, I really enjoyed your show. Heh. Actually, you might recognize me since I'm a... pause for dramatic effect... a Wonderbolt.\nShort Fuse and Rolling Thunder: [laugh]\nRolling Thunder: [Australian accent] Ha! Join the club.\nScootaloo: [excited noises]\nRainbow Dash: O... kay...\nRolling Thunder: No. I mean, literally. Join the club. We're called \"The Washouts\" because we all used to be Wonderbolts just like you. Heh. Until we \"washed out\".\nRainbow Dash: No way!\nRolling Thunder: Yep. [sighs] Name's Rolling Thunder. I got booted out of Wonderbolt Academy because of \"flagrant disregard for hazardous weather\". Pfft! If doing barrel rolls through nine hundred million volts of electricity in a raging thunderstorm is wrong, then I don't wanna be right.\nRainbow Dash: Cool!\nRolling Thunder: Ha. This 'ere's Short Fuse.\nShort Fuse: Ah, nice to meet you.\nRainbow Dash: What's your story?\nShort Fuse: ANGER ISSUES! GET OFF MY BACK!\nRainbow Dash: Uhhh... Okay. So, who's the leader?\nRolling Thunder: Only the most reckless ex-Wonderbolt of all time.\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] Lightning Dust!\nLightning Dust: Rainbow Dash!\nRainbow Dash: [snarls]\nScootaloo: Scootaloo. I'm Scootaloo. Hi.\n\nRainbow Dash: Lightning Dust! I should've known you were the brains behind a crazy idea like the Washouts! Or should I say, \"lack of brains\"!\nLightning Dust: [snarls]\nScootaloo: You two really know each other? Oh, my gosh! This is so cool!\nLightning Dust: Your \"friend\" got me kicked out of the Wonderbolts.\nScootaloo: Oh. That's, uh, less cool.\nLightning Dust: And it was the best thing that ever happened to me! Great to see you, wingpony! I heard you're a full-fledged Bolt now.\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, well, I'm still\u2014\nLightning Dust: Mad at me? Look, was it wrong of me to endanger the lives of your friends? Yeah. But, hey, now I only endanger these knuckleheads.\nRolling Thunder and Short Fuse: [laugh]\nShort Fuse: [through gritted teeth] Don't call me \"Knucklehead\"! [laughs]\nLightning Dust: C'mon, you know you miss me. Me and her, we blew everypony out of the sky.\nScootaloo: Really?\nLightning Dust: Actually, yeah, really! All that wind was totally dangerous, but we had fun, right? Two fastest times on the Dizzitron!\nRainbow Dash: If I remember correctly, I had you beat by half a second.\nLightning Dust: Only because when I went, I cranked up the dizziness factor.\nRainbow Dash and Lightning Dust: [laugh]\nRainbow Dash: Well, I'm glad it all worked out. Your show was pretty dynamite.\nLightning Dust: [to Scootaloo] Wanna know the secret? We basically ignore everything the Wonderbolts ever taught us about safety.\nRainbow Dash: Well, we do have safety rules for a reason.\nLightning Dust: Don't listen to her, kid. All their \"rules\" were just ways of keeping their little club exclusive so they could feel good about themselves.\nRainbow Dash: It's not about making anypony feel bad. It's about finding the best flyers. The best of the best.\nLightning Dust: I started the Washouts because I believe anypony can be the best of the best. You know, Rolling Thunder is gonna be out for a while.\nRolling Thunder: Ah, during the finale, I caught the old hind leg in the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot! Patent pending.\nLightning Dust: There's a spot on the team if you wanna join up.\nScootaloo: [gasps]\nRainbow Dash: I appreciate the offer, but I'm already a Wonderbolt.\nScootaloo: I'll do it! Can I do it?!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, lemme think. No!\nScootaloo: [scoffs] I wasn't asking you!\nLightning Dust: Awww, you're cute. But technically, you haven't washed out of the Bolts, which is kinda our thing.\nRainbow Dash: And also, no!\nScootaloo: Oh, what if I joined and dropped out super quick?!\nRainbow Dash: That's it! You're comin' with me!\nScootaloo: Where are we going?\nRainbow Dash: To hear what the actual Wonderbolts think about you joining just to drop out for the Washouts!\nLightning Dust: Say hi to Spitfire for me!\n\n[Wonderbolts theme]\nScootaloo: [yawns]\nRainbow Dash: Ever seen two simultaneous inverse displacement rolls before?\nScootaloo: [scoffs] Would've been a lot cooler if you had the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot, patent pending.\nRainbow Dash: You... What?! [to Spitfire] See? This is what I was telling you about.\nSpitfire: I got this. [to Scootaloo] You know what happens when something goes wrong with the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot?\nRainbow Dash: Patent pending?\nSpitfire: You end up in a full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!\nScootaloo: But with enough practice\u2014\nSpitfire: Practice?! Well, la-dee-doodle-dah! Lemme give you a different scenario. You're probably saying to yourself, \"I'm young. I'm strong. I'm gonna go out there and stunt some tricks with my new friend Lightning Dust!\" Well, I'm here to tell ya that if ya play that game, you're gonna find out it's pretty hard to \"stunt tricks\" in a full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!\nRainbow Dash: I think she gets the poi\u2014\nSpitfire: I'm not finished! Listen, I get it, kid. I used to be like you, tellin' myself, \"I'm gonna touch the sky!\"\nScootaloo: I don't\u2014\nSpitfire: Well, whoop-dee-doodle-doo! You think you got it made in the shade? Well, things are gonna be pretty shady indeed when you can't go out in the sun, 'cause you're in a full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw! Do I make myself clear?!\nScootaloo: [shakily] Uh-huh...\nSpitfire: Excellent. Have a hat.\n\nRainbow Dash: Uh... Heh. Sorry that was a little... intense. I just wanna make sure you don't get hurt. That way, you can follow in my hoofsteps. Heh. Everypony's dream, right?\nScootaloo: More like \"follow your wingflaps\".\nRainbow Dash: Same difference.\nScootaloo: [sarcastically] Thanks, super-talented flyer, for clearing up what I should do.\nRainbow Dash: Clearing things up is one of my specialties. Now, come on. Let's go rip up all your Washout posters into tiny pieces and throw 'em off a cliff.\n\nRainbow Dash: I just thought of a great way to raise awareness for your original fan club. You know, the one about me?\n[clatter]\nRainbow Dash: How about a silent auction where every item is just a picture of yours truly? [laughs] Nah! I'm just kidding.\n[blow dryer blowing]\nRainbow Dash: That makes me seem too egotistical, doesn't it? Oh, oh! Maybe if they're framed, it's like, \"Wow, she's so humble!\" Ya think? Scootaloo?\n[door opens]\nRainbow Dash: Uh, Scootaloo?\n\nRainbow Dash: Anypony seen Scootalo\u2014\n[bump!]\nRainbow Dash: Ow! My fault, my fault! Sorry, I\u2014 Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans] Sorry. I was just... um...\nRainbow Dash: Please tell me you got that stuff so you could rip it up and throw it off a cliff.\nTwilight Sparkle: They were doing an autograph session before practice.\nRainbow Dash: Seriously?! [groans] You haven't seen Scoot, have you?\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually...\n\nRainbow Dash: I can't believe Scootaloo ditched me to watch them practice! Why can't she see how dangerous they are?!\nTwilight Sparkle: That's kind of the whole draw. It's exciting.\nRainbow Dash: But it's like the harder I try to convince Scoot they're dangerous, the more she likes them!\nTwilight Sparkle: You can't control her actions. Only yours. Teach her what's safe and what isn't, like a good role model. Then hope she makes the right decisions.\nRainbow Dash: But what if she chooses them over me? She's gonna get hurt!\nTwilight Sparkle: I think I know somepony else who might get hurt if that happens.\nRainbow Dash: Um, maybe you're right. But this isn't about me. I'm just worried about Scoot.\n\n[clanging]\nShort Fuse: Wow. You're really workin' hard on this new stunt. [chomps, spits] What kind of sorry excuse for a tomato sandwich is this?!\nLightning Dust: Sorry, Dash. Autograph session's over. Unless you wanna buy Short Fuse's limited edition half-eaten tomato sandwich.\nShort Fuse: I'm not signing that abomination!\nRainbow Dash: You haven't seen Scootaloo, have you?\nLightning Dust: Ohhhh, isn't she that pony that used to respect you?\nRainbow Dash: [growls] I'd appreciate you helping me find her so I could apologize for trying to make her quit liking you.\nLightning Dust: [laughs] Oh, I'm pretty sure she still likes us.\nRainbow Dash: [gasps]\n\nRainbow Dash: Lightning Dust, I know we go way back, but I can't let her do this!\nScootaloo: I don't need you standing up for me!\nRainbow Dash: Obviously, you do! Because you can't see how dangerous this is! Do you not remember what Spitfire said?\nLightning Dust: Ugh. Lemme guess. [imitating Spitfire] You'll be in a full-body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!\nRainbow Dash: That doesn't even sound like Spitfire.\nScootaloo: [laughing]\nRainbow Dash: That's it! We're leaving!\nScootaloo: Just because I look up to you doesn't mean I have to be you! But based on your definition of what makes somepony great, I have bad news. I'll never be the best of the best or a Wonderbolt! Because I! Can't! Fly! Is that what you wanted to hear? But not being able to fly doesn't mean I can't do something awesome! Like strapping my scooter to a multi-stage liquid-fueled rocket and jumping twenty-two wagons lined up in front of a roaring crowd!\nTwilight Sparkle: That was awfully specific.\nLightning Dust: That's 'cause it's what she'll be doing in the show tonight. Half off for princesses! [whispering] Bring your friends!\nTwilight Sparkle: Scootaloo, are you sure that's what you really wanna do?\nScootaloo: Absolutely. [to Rainbow] And there's nothing you can do to stop me!\nRainbow Dash: You're right. You're your own foal, and you have to make your own decisions.\nScootaloo: Good! Because I already have!\nRainbow Dash: [sighs]\n\n[crowd chattering]\nPinkie Pie: Sorry for making us late again. Who would've guessed Scootaloo's super-difficult stunt special cupcakes would've been super-difficult to bake? [chomps]\nApplejack: Hoo-wee! Looks like all of Ponyville is here. Except for Rainbow Dash.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\nAnnouncer: And here to introduce the most dangerous stunt we've ever performed, it's your fearless captain, L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-Lightning Dust!\n[crowd cheers]\nLightning Dust: In just a moment, the newest member of the Washouts will be rocket-sledding down that hill, up that ramp, and over all twenty-two wagons to land on the other side in one piece! Heh. If she's lucky.\n[crowd gasps]\nLightning Dust: Put your hooves together for Half-Pint Dynamite!\n[crowd cheers]\nScootaloo: Lightning Dust, I have to tell you. I actually started Equestria's first Washouts fan club! As far as I know. So this is a real honor, ma'am! Uh, do I call you \"ma'am\"?\nLightning Dust: You land this jump, you can call me whatever you want.\nScootaloo: Wow. That sure is...\nLightning Dust: Dangerous? Nah! Well, maybe a little.\nScootaloo: Has anypony tested it before?\nLightning Dust: Where's the fun in that?\nScootaloo: [gulps]\n[tape stretching]\nScootaloo: There's m-more?!\nLightning Dust: You're not thinking of backing out, are you?\nScootaloo: No! I'm just thinking about drinking through straws.\nLightning Dust: Are you the president of my fan club or not?\nScootaloo: Of course! It's just\u2014\nLightning Dust: You wouldn't wanna get impeached for dishonoring my wishes, would you?\nScootaloo: I... Is that a thing?\nLightning Dust: Light it up!\n[flames roaring]\nScootaloo: Okay. Now I am thinking about backing out.\nLightning Dust: Too late!\n[rockets roaring]\n[crowd cheering]\nScootaloo: [whimpering]\n[crowd gasps]\n[whoosh!]\nRainbow Dash: I know I was supposed to let you make your own decisions, but that doesn't mean I can't swoop in and save you from time to time.\nLightning Dust: If I'd known you were gonna bail, I would've done the trick myself!\nRainbow Dash: Great! So you won't mind how that rope's about to coil around your hoof.\n[snap!]\nLightning Dust: RIVALS FOR LIIIIIFE!\nRainbow Dash: Wouldn't have it any other way!\nScootaloo: I'm sorry for joining the Washouts. Lightning Dust wasn't who I thought she was. She didn't care about me being scared or putting me in danger. She only wanted a good show, even if it meant I got hurt. That's not the kind of pony I wanna look up to.\nRainbow Dash: I'm the one who should be apologizing for not acting like somepony who deserves a fan club. I've been lucky enough to have somepony who thinks I'm the coolest. But there's nothing cool about making you feel like you'll never be as awesome as me. I think we should cancel the Washouts Fan Club. Because I know a fan club that could use some new members.\nScootaloo: The Rainbow Dash Fan Club!\n\n[bang, bang, bang]\nRainbow Dash: [clears throat] Welcome to the first ever meeting of the newest fan club for the awesomest, previously under-appreciated pony in Ponyville! With founding member and president Rainbow Dash presiding, it's the... Scootaloo Fan Club!\n[fans cheering]\nScootaloo: You know, Rainbow Dash was right. Eavesdropping on your own fan club isn't weird at all.\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[digging sounds]\n[clunk!]\nRockhoof: [grunting and laughing] You're going to have to work faster than that if you plan to dig up my whole village, lass. Let me help.\nProfessor Fossil: [yelps]\n[thud!]\nProfessor Fossil: Er... Thank you, Rockhoof, but we're trying to carefully preserve every bit of history here.\nRockhoof: Aye. This place is full of memories. Did I tell you about the time our chieftain knocked down five boulders with the kick of a wee ball?\nProfessor Fossil: [gasps] Stop that!\n[ball thunks]\nRockhoof: But... [stutters] That's what this is for.\nProfessor Fossil: Maybe in the past. [blows] Now it belongs in a museum. Safe. Preserved. Untouched.\nRockhoof: Agh! Next you'll be sayin' I shouldn't have used the old sweat lodge.\nProfessor Fossil: [gasps]\n[crash!]\n\nProfessor Fossil: So, you see why Rockhoof isn't an ideal fit for my team. Perhaps you could use his, uh... unusual talents?\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course, Professor Fossil! We'd be honored to have a Pillar of Equestria on our staff!\nProfessor Fossil: Oh, thank Celestia.\n[door closes]\nRockhoof: [slurps, crunch] Ugh! [spits, groans] That apple's made of wood! What a horrible trick to play!\n[whack!]\nRarity: Hmm. Has anypony seen my decorative centerpieces?

Thank you, all! I know I'm new to your world, but there's one thing I learned when I saved my village from a rushing river of hot lava. There's nothing you can't do with hard work.

We'll... see you in class!\n\n[students chattering]\nSmolder: You think that new pony is gonna be the weirdest teacher at school or just one of the weirdest?\nYona: Yona like new teacher. He big like yak!\nGallus: And he smashes things like a yak, smells like a yak...\nYona: Yes! He perfect!\nSandbar: Guys, he's one of the Pillars! He's like... pony history!\nRockhoof: Hello, class!\n[crash!]\nRockhoof: Eh, um... [clears throat] I'm, uh, your new \"Theory and Defense of Friendship\" teacher.\n[creaking]\nRockhoof: But, uh, I haven't had a chance to look at Headmare Twilight's notes yet. What have you all been learnin'?\nOcellus:  We just studied all about how Princess Celestia and Luna used a spell to trap Discord in stone sleep for hundreds of moons.\nRockhoof: Ohhhh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! So it's a class about stories, is it?\nGallus: Stories! Yeah! And we never, ever, ever get homework!\nRockhoof: Good! The best way to teach colts and fillies is by experience. Like the time I was in the woods and I ran across an ursa major!\nSilverstream: Really?!\nSandbar: We're not doing that, right?\nYona: You fight ursa major? All alone?\nRockhoof: Aye. And I defeated her, too.\nSmolder: Now this I'm interested in!\nYona: How Professor Rockhoof win?\nRockhoof: Well... that's quite a tale.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: From what Professor Fossil said, it sounds like Rockhoof just hasn't settled into modern times yet. Our school is the perfect place for that. Plus, we get a new teacher.\nApplejack: [chuckles] This may be the fastest friendship problem you ever solved.\n[crash!]\n\nRockhoof: Dodge! Thrust! Shovel leap! Shovel throw!\n[crunch!]\n[thud!]\nRockhoof: Shovel whack! Now you lot be the ursa major. Lots o' growlin', mind?\nGallus, Yona, and Silverstream: [growling]\nRockhoof: [laughing]\n[thunk!]\n[students cheering]\nApplejack: Maybe classrooms were less breakable in the old days?\nYona: Ooh-ooh-ooh! What happened next?\nRockhoof: [laughing] The huge beastie jumped out of the moonlit mist, her fearsome fangs at my throat! But I rolled clear.\n[crash!]\nSilverstream: Then what?\nRockhoof: She backed me up against a wall, ready to pounce!\n[students gasping]\nRockhoof: I looked at her. She looked at me. And I say\u2014!\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, Professor Rockhoof?\nRockhoof: Nope! Guess again! [clears throat] Uh, oops.\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry to interrupt. Class, why don't we go ahead and take lunch early today? Rockhoof, can we take a walk outside?\n[students chattering]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Our school is about finding your own special way to teach.\nApplejack: And we can already tell you're a... smash with the class. [chuckles]\nTwilight Sparkle: But maybe you could do a little less smashing in the classroom?\nRockhoof: Sorry about that. I did get a bit carried away. The students were so interested in my tale. [grunting]\nTwilight Sparkle: I know it's a big change. But I think you're gonna fit in just\u2014\n[flames roaring]\n[boom!]\nRockhoof: Fire!\nTwilight Sparkle: Rockhoof, wait!\nRockhoof: No time! The building's ablaze! We have to get everypony out!\n\nYona: Professor Rockhoof best teacher ever! [sighs] Day cannot get better.\n[crash!]\nRockhoof: Let's get you outside, wee ones!\nYona: Day just got better!\nRockhoof: [grunts]\nSilverstream: [yelps]\nRockhoof: Alley-oop!\nApplejack: Rockhoof?\nTwilight Sparkle: What are you doing?!\nRockhoof: Savin' the school!\n[shatter!]\n[water splashing]\nRockhoof: Just like fightin' a volcano in the good old days!\nRarity: Would somepony kindly explain what is the meaning of all this water?!\nPinkie Pie: I'm not sure. But I think it's surf's up! Woo-hoo! Cowabunga!\nRockhoof: Sorry, Rarity, but I had to put out the ragin' inferno.\nSpike: Inferno? Where?\nRockhoof: Did you not see the smoke and flame?\nSmolder: Yeah, that was us. You know, dragons? Having a fire-breathing competition?\nRockhoof: You, uh... what?\nTwilight Sparkle: [panting] They do it all the time. That's what we were trying to tell you.\nApplejack: We know you're used to bein' a hero, Rockhoof. Only what we need here is a teacher.\nRarity: One who doesn't ruin an entire class's friendship quilts. Do you know how hard it is to stitch a pineapple pattern?!\nRockhoof: [sighs] My deepest apologies. I'm not used to living with dragons or much else in this modern time. Professor Fossil made it clear I'm not welcome back in my old village. Seems I don't belong here either.\nPinkie Pie: Wheeeee!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: So apparently, finding Rockhoof a new job is a lot harder than we thought. Has anypony had any luck?\nRest of Mane Six: [negative muttering]\nApplejack: I-I thought you were gonna try him out at the post office.\nTwilight Sparkle: We did.\n\nRockhoof: [yelling] Do you know where I can find Cranky Doodle Donkey?! I need to deliver his medicine! He has a rash in a very embarrassing place!\n\nSpike: [shudders] I did not need to hear that.\nRarity: Yup. Rockhoof's time as a spa masseuse didn't work out either.\n\nRockhoof: Now just let me know if this is too much pressure!\n[crunch!]\nBulk Biceps: [high-pitched shriek]\n\nRainbow Dash: W-Well, at least Rockhoof's really strong. Maybe we could find him a job carrying heavy stuff?\nPinkie Pie: I tried that already. Zecora needed somepony to help her get supplies, but...\n\n[knock, knock]\n[door opens]\nRockhoof: I know you said you only needed a few leaves, but I figured why not bring you the whole thing?\n[bees buzzing]\n\nRarity: Oh, how horrid.\nFluttershy: None of the other Pillars seem to be having trouble fitting into the modern world.\nApplejack: Then maybe they can show Rockhoof how they did it. Get him used to livin' in this time.\nTwilight Sparkle: Great idea! Rockhoof's old friends would be happy to help. And I bet he'd love to visit them.\n\nRockhoof: [sighs] Even Canterlot looks different from the old days.\nApplejack: Aww. I'm sure once you see your old pal Flash Magnus, you'll feel right at home.\nFlash Magnus: Trot, two, three, four! Trot, two, three, four! Keep it lively, rookies! Visitors on site! Company, halt! Rockhoof, you old ditch-digger you!\nRockhoof: Flash Magnus, as I live and breathe! Is this your squadron?\nFlash Magnus: After we got out of limbo, I went looking for work for a pony with experience in the Royal Legion. Once a soldier, always a soldier.\nTwilight Sparkle: Princess Celestia was happy to find a new drill sergeant for her guard!\nRockhoof: Uh... that's great. She really put you in a job that big so soon?\nFlash Magnus: Ho-ho, this is nothing. You should see what Mistmane is up to.\n\n[shimmering sounds]\nRockhoof: They made you the royal landscape artist for the Crystal Empire?\nApplejack: Wow...\nTwilight Sparkle: Your work is beautiful.\nMistmane: Oh, thank you. I've never worked with crystal before, but in my heart, I know I'm where I belong.\nRockhoof: You always could find the beauty in things. But there's not much demand for shovel ponies like me nowadays.\nMistmane: Don't give up hope. See Somnambula. She'll help you find your purpose.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [whispering] Somnambula's a motivational speaker. Bet they didn't even have those back in your time.\nRockhoof: [whispering] Because we didn't need them. Ponies knew what to do with their lives.\nSomnambula: Focus on my voice and feel yourself unlock your potential. [inhaling and exhaling] Imagine everything that troubles you as one big cloud. Now let it float away. You are relaxed. Free to do anything you wish.\nRockhoof: [snoring loudly]\nApplejack: Guess he wished he could take a nap?\n\nRockhoof: Mage Meadowbrook, your home looks just the same as the old days. Wish I could say the same for mine.\nMage Meadowbrook: Well, I've had to expand my clinic a bit. Many creatures need healin' in this modern world. Aww. Looks like you could use some, too. What's got you heartsick, Rockhoof?\n[thud!]\n[bottles clattering]\nRockhoof: Thing is, I can't do my old job like Flash. Or adapt like Mistmane. Or succeed at something new like Somnambula. Or go home, like you.\nMage Meadowbrook: Give it time. Even Star Swirl's still learnin' about friendship.\nApplejack: Yeah! And I bet Stygian took plenty o' time to fit in.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey, look what I found! Me and My Shadow, the third hit novel by former villain Stygian! I'm impressed! He's really thriving!\nRockhoof: [sighs]\nTwilight Sparkle: Rockhoof? Where are you going?\nRockhoof: I'm not sure. Maybe I just don't belong in this modern world.\n\nApplejack: Now this here's a right mash of apples. 'Stead of solvin' Rockhoof's problem, we made him feel even worse.\nRainbow Dash: I'll tell you the real problem here. We haven't given Rockhoof the chance to be who he really is.\nPinkie Pie: A pony with a metal shovel and a heart of gold?\nRainbow Dash: Ugh. A hero! What we need to do is find him a job that's as epic as he is!\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmm. I might know just the thing.\n\nRockhoof: I'm honored to serve in the Hippogriff Navy, General Seaspray! I promise I'll prove my worth.\nSeaspray: Think nothing of it. I know how hard it is to adapt to a new home. After our many years below the waves, land customs seemed strange.\nRockhoof: Like you didn't fit in, no matter how hard you tried?\nSeaspray: As though the world had moved on without us. Never fear, Rockhoof. We shall be as brothers in this bright future above the waves.\nApplejack: [whispering, to Twilight Sparkle] Uh, why do the Hippogriffs need ships if they can turn into seaponies?\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe they just like cruises?\nHippogriff Sailor: General! The fog's too thick to see our way out of the harbor!\n[water rushing]\nSeaspray: Heave to, swabbies! Halt the ship and hold her 'til the fog passes!\nRockhoof: Wait, General! We can navigate the same way my Coltic ancestors traveled through the Selkie Mists! We'll look to the stars! There in the northwest sky is the constellation O'Bridle's Pelt! Steer the ship toward that!\nSeaspray: You heard the pony, crew! Make full sail!\n[water rushing]\nApplejack: Yee-haw! Rockhoof did it!\n[crash!]\nRockhoof: But... I don't understand! The stars have always steered me true!\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, no. Stars can move slowly over time. They must look different now than over a thousand years ago.\nSeaspray: It was an honor serving with you, Rockhoof. But it seems our paths lie in different directions.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey, mistakes happen. We'll think of something else for you to do.\nRockhoof: Oh, there's no need, lass. I already know what I want to do next.\nApplejack: Really? What?\nRockhoof: I heard there's a statue spell that sends creatures into stone sleep. I want you to cast it. On me.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\n\nSpike: [muttering sleepily]\nTwilight Sparkle: No!\nRockhoof: Yes!\nTwilight Sparkle: No!\nRockhoof: Aye!\nSpike: [groans]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: No!\nRockhoof: Aye!\n[door opens]\nSpike: Hey, guys. Need me to help you decide something?\nTwilight Sparkle: Rockhoof wants me to cast a spell to turn him into a statue! The answer is no!\nRockhoof: Well, it should be \"aye\", because I wouldn't even be here to be turned into a statue if Twilight hadn't cast a spell in the first place! [stomps]\nSpike: Whoa. I thought you were arguing over ice cream flavors.\nTwilight Sparkle: The answer is still no! Why would you want to be turned into stone?\nRockhoof: Because I'm a relic of a bygone age. I belong in a museum. Safe. Preserved. Untouched. I don't belong in this time. It's up to you to make that right.\nTwilight Sparkle: But there has to be a better way!\nRockhoof: Twilight, please understand. I want to be remembered as the hero I was, not the disappointment I've become.\nTwilight Sparkle: But you're not! Rockhoof, wait! Spike, can you teach my class today?\nSpike: Uh, you're not really going to turn him to stone, are you?\nTwilight Sparkle: Only because it's temporary. As soon as I think of a new solution, we'll wake Rockhoof up. I know he has more to offer the world as a pony than a statue.\n\nSandbar: Did you hear Rockhoof caught all the bees in the Everfree Forest and gave 'em to Zecora as a gift?\nSilverstream: Wow! Terramar said Rockhoof called down the stars and sunk the whole Hippogriff Navy!\nSmolder: He's definitely weird, but in a fun way. You never know what's gonna happen next with him.\nYona: Professor Rockhoof best pony!\nSpike: Hey, class. Welcome to the Theory and Defense of Friendship.\nGallus: Another sub? Let me start by telling you we don't get homework and we only do field trips.\nSpike: Yeeeeah. Nice try. Twilight sent me to tell you she won't be in today 'cause she has to cast a stone sleep spell on Rockhoof.\n[students gasp]\nOcellus: Like Discord?! But why?! Rockhoof isn't a bad guy!\nSpike: [\"I don't know\" sound] Your instructions are to write an essay on heroism and what it means to you.\nYona: No!\nSpike: Oh, don't worry. It doesn't have to be a long essay.\n\nRockhoof: Maybe like this? Or on three legs? Hmm. What will give the wee birds fewer places to, uh... decorate?\nYona: Professor Rockhoof! Dragon said you want to turn into stone! Yona not believe it!\nRockhoof: Aye, I'm afraid it's true, lass.\nYona: But... pony need finish ursa major story for class!\nRockhoof: Oh, it's sweet of you to try to get me to stay, Yona. But I'm afraid old stories like mine aren't worth anything in this day and age.\nYona: Fine! If pony no want tell Yona story, then Yona tell pony story! From class report! [reading] \"When Yona come to pony school, Yona not fit in. Pony ways strange. But Yona find friends! Yona meet Professor Rockhoof! Pony brave and strong as yak! Not afraid! Hero! When Yona grow up, Yona want to be just like Professor Rockhoof!\"\nRockhoof: Well, uh, since you went to the trouble of writing something that nice, I suppose the least I could do is tell you the rest of the story.\nYona: Yona tell whole school Rockhoof is best! Now all want to hear story!\n\n[doors open]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, I have the spell. But will you please reconsider? Rockhoof?\nRockhoof: The ursa major tried to grab me by the gullet! But I ducked her claws!\n[students in awe]\nRockhoof: She had me cornered. So I look at her. She looks at me.\nFluttershy: [gasps]\nRockhoof: And I say, \"Sorry you won't be having any dinner tonight, lass! Guess you'll just have to... grin and bear it!\"\n[students laughing]\nRockhoof: And then I tossed her away with my shovel high into the sky! And she's been a constellation up there ever since! Or so I'm told. And that's the end of my story.\nStudents: One more story! One more story!\nRockhoof: No, no. Thank you for listening. But it's time to say goodbye.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait. You said there wasn't anything in this time you were good at. What about telling stories?\nRockhoof: It was just a tall tale.\nTwilight Sparkle: One that captured the hearts and imagination of everycreature here.\nYona: Plus, pony story super fun!\n[students cheering]\nTwilight Sparkle: As the Princess of Friendship, I'd like to appoint you as Equestria's official keeper of tales!\nSpike: Can you do that?\nTwilight Sparkle: Eh.\nRockhoof: I, uh... That's very kind of you. But I still think these old bones are more suited to a museum display.\nTwilight Sparkle: You are a living record of our history. Your stories can inspire and teach generations to come. If you're a statue, that's all lost.\nRockhoof: But will I ever really belong in your world?\nYona: Rockhoof Yona's friend. So Rockhoof belongs!\nRockhoof: You know... That reminds me of another story. Once, there was a small yak that knew more than a great hero.\nSmolder: Hey, don't forget the dragons in this one!\nRockhoof: Aye, there were dragons. And ponies. And plenty of Hippogriffs. Plus a changeling and a griffon...\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nTwilight Sparkle: The Tree of Harmony remains one of the most powerful sources of magic known to ponydom. And though it has been at the \"root\" of magic and friendship from the moment it was planted, its ways are mysterious. Almost as if it has a mind of its own.\nSmolder: Mind? [scoffs] It's a tree.\nTwilight Sparkle: A tree that grew a castle.\nSilverstream: Was that before or after Discord made chocolate rain?\nCozy Glow: [whispers] After.\nGallus: I'm never gonna learn pony history!\n[school bell rings]\nTwilight Sparkle: You can all show me what you've learned on tomorrow's test \u2013 \"Friendship's Effect on the Course of Equestrian History\".\n[students groan]\nTwilight Sparkle: Remember! Study groups are both fun and effective!\n\n[students chattering]\nSandbar: So, who wants to study together?\nGallus: With other students? This is Equestria! If you want the real scoop, there's only one place to go. Hello, oh maaaaagical Equestrian tree! Can you tell me everything I need to know about friendship?\n[beat]\nSandbar: [groans]\nYoung Six: [laughing]\n[shimmering sounds]\n\n[theme song]\n\nSmolder: The Elements of Harmony grew the Tree?\nSandbar and Ocellus: [groan]\nOcellus: No! The Pillars grew the Tree.\nSandbar: The Tree grew the Elements, and then the box with six locks.\nOcellus: But our professors found six keys and unlocked the box.\nGallus: I'm so gonna fail.\nSilverstream: You guys! Check this out!\nGallus: That's a plumbing diagram on how to fix a sink.\nSilverstream: [giggles]\nSandbar: What does that have to do with Equestrian history?\nSilverstream: Nothing. I just can't believe that's how sinks work! Where's Yona?\nYona: [snoring]\nSmolder: [laughs] Apparently, [imitating Yona] yaks no love study groups!\nGallus: Shhhh. [laughs]\nYona: [snoring] Spider! No!\nYoung Six: [laughing]\nCozy Glow: [giggles]\nSandbar: Hey, Cozy. What are you doing here?\nCozy Glow: I volunteered to help Professor Sparkle organize these books. So, experts on Equestrian history yet?\nGallus: I think I'd be better off studying the plumbing book. This stuff is impossible.\n[changeling zap]\nOcellus: Oh, come on, Gallus! With good friends and solid study habits, anything is possible!\nGallus: [laughs]\nSmolder: How about you just tell us what's on tomorrow's test, professor?\nRest of Young Six: [excited chatter]\n[changeling zap]\nOcellus: Now, hold on a sec. I can't give y'all a sneak peek. That there wouldn't be honest.\nRest of Young Six: [laughing]\nCozy Glow: [clears throat] Golly, it's so inspiring how relaxed you all are about studying friendship, considering your disadvantage.\nYona: What cute pony mean?\nCozy Glow: Just consider where you all came from. If Sandbar hadn't sacrificed so much of his time to get you up to speed, who knows how behind you'd be?\nSandbar: That's... not what\u2014\nCozy Glow: [to Ocellus] I mean, growing up as a love-starved changeling? [to Silverstream] Or hiding underwater from an evil king all those years? Trusting anycreature must be so hard for you. [to Gallus] And griffons never want to be around anycreature, even other griffons. [to Smolder] And dragons are so fierce compared to us. There must be days you can't wait to get away from all us cute ponies. [to Yona, imitating Yona] \"Everypony know yaks think yaks are best!\" Making friends with any other creature must seem like a step down. It's just so impressive how you keep trying to understand friendship, even though it isn't in your nature. Oh! I'll let you borrow my notes! It's what friends do. I'll be right back!\nSilverstream: We... should... get back to studying.\n\n[tapping]\n[loud, echoing tapping]\nGallus: Could you stop that clicking?! I'm trying to focus!\nSandbar: Dude!\nGallus: What? We have a test. I don't know every detail about every adventure the professors went on like you do.\nOcellus: That's why we're studying together.\nSmolder: Right. To help us \"disadvantaged\" creatures.\nYona: Yona confused. Why we all upset?\n[clang!]\n[shimmering sounds]\nSilverstream: I only glanced at that plumbing book, but I'm pretty sure this isn't supposed to be here.\nOcellus: What are you doing?\nSmolder: Dragon. Strange magical cave. What do you think I'm doing?\nOcellus: [grunts]\nSandbar: [startled whinny]\n\n[shimmering sounds]\nSilverstream: Did we know this was down here?\nSandbar: I don't think anypony knows this is down here.\n[hoofsteps echoing]\nIllusion Twilight Sparkle: [stilted] Welcome.\nSandbar: Headmare Twilight? Where are we?\nIllusion Twilight Sparkle: [stilted] Where you need to be.\nYona: Uh, Yona confused.\nIllusion Twilight Sparkle: [stilted] It is as I feared. You are not one. What has happened?\nOcellus: We were studying friendship's effect on history, but then...\nGallus: Since friendship just isn't in our nature, what's the point?\nIllusion Twilight Sparkle: [stilted] You do not believe friendship is in your nature? That is NOT acceptable!\n[wind whistling]\nSilverstream: Our headmare is glowing, you guys. What is going on?!\nOcellus: We should probably get back to studying for the test.\n[wind stops]\nIllusion Twilight Sparkle: A test. Yes. By sunrise, this door will be closed. Finish the test before then, and you may go. Fail the test, and here you will stay.\n[teleportation zaps]\n\nSandbar: Huh?\n\nGallus: Huh?\n\nSmolder: Huh?\n\nYona: [shudders]\n\n[water rushing]\nSilverstream: Ooh!\n[splash]\nSilverstream: Mount Aris? Headmare Twilight sent me home? Wait. Am I suspended? Hello? Anygriff here? Hmm. They must be topside.\n[distant growling]\nSilverstream: Huh? [gasps, screams]\n[magic zap]\n[splash]\nSilverstream: [screams]\n[growling sounds]\nSilverstream: The Storm King?! He's back?!\n\nGallus: Big room. No exits. Big deal.\n[shing!]\n[cracking sounds]\nGallus: Not cool! [hyperventilates]\n\nYona: Nothing for yaks to be afraid of. Just empty cave. Nothing in here can hurt\u2014\n[skittering]\nYona: ...Yona.\n[spiders chittering]\n\nSmolder: Ugh. Things like this just don't happen in the Dragon Lands. Huh?\nStepford Pony 1: ...And I told her she was the cutest pony of all ponies!\nStepford Pony 2: [to Smolder] Ohhh! Aren't you just the most adorable thing? Come join us.\n[beat]\nSmolder: No. On so many levels. No.\n[screech!]\nSmolder: Huh?\nStepford Pony 1: Come sit by me, and let's compliment each other!\nSmolder: [groans]\n\nOcellus: [gasps] Why do you look like that?\nChangeling 1: What do you mean? We all look the same.\nOcellus: Not me.\nChangeling 2: Of course not you... your Majesty. We'll go drain the love from those pathetic ponies in Ponyville just as you ordered.\nOcellus: [whimpers, gasps] Nooooo!\n\nIllusion Rarity: Oh! Thank heavens we found you!\nIllusion Rainbow Dash: There's an emergency! And we need you, Sandbar!\nSandbar: [gasps] My first friendship adventure! Yes! Count me in! Oh, I've been waiting for this\u2014 Wait! The others!\nIllusion Rainbow Dash: We don't need them! We need you! Come on!\n\n[shing!]\n[cracking sounds]\nGallus: Aah! Come on, Gallus. Get it together. Deep breaths. [inhaling and exhaling] Ah... Ahh... Achoo!\n[shing!]\nGallus: [panicked whimpering] Okay. If this is a test, there's got to be a way out. It's just a puzzle... that will squash you if you don't figure it out.\n[shing!]\n[cracking sounds]\nGallus: [laughs] No pressure. [exhales]\n[shing!]\n[cracking sounds]\n[shing!]\n[cracking sounds]\n[shing!]\nGallus: Oops.\n[cracking sounds]\n[shing!]\n[cracking sounds]\nGallus: [panting]\n[shing!]\n[cracking sounds]\nGallus: Hah! [grunting]\n[shing!]\n[cracking sounds]\n[thud]\n\nSmolder: [groans] Look. I have to get out of here and find my friends. So just tell me what I have to do to pass this test. I'm not afraid of anything.\nStepford Pony 2: Um, I dunno. Seems like she's afraid to be cute and adorable, doesn't it?\nStepford Pony 1: Or maybe she's just afraid to admit she likes being cute and adorable.\nStepford Pony 2: Mm-hmm!\nSmolder: Just this once. [clears throat, cute voice] May I have some tea, please?\nStepford Pony 1: Aw, but you can't have tea if you aren't dressed for it.\nSmolder: Okay. But let's keep this between us.\n\nSmolder: [slurps, giggles]\n\nYona: [panting]\n[spiders chittering]\nYona: Huh? [panicked grunting, screams]\n[thud!]\nYona: [screams, panting, screams, whimpers] Yona need help! Where Yona's friends when Yona need them?! [screams]\n[spider chitters]\nYona: Huh?\n[spider chitters]\nYona: Yona... no mean to scream. Yona love making friends. Spiders friends?\n[spider chitters]\nYona: Wait. What little spider say?\n\n[cracking sounds]\nSmolder: What happened to you?\nGallus: What happened to you?\nSmolder: You never saw any of that. Got it?\n[cracking sounds]\nGallus: Maybe the others got out already and we're the last ones?\nSmolder: [sarcastic] Yeah, that totally seems like something they would do.\nGallus: [groans] Any other dragon or griffon would save themselves and get out of this crazy cave.\nSmolder: Guess we aren't just any dragon or griffon anymore.\nGallus: Guess not. You go that way. I'll check over there.\n\nSandbar: Wait. I really should find my friends.\nIllusion Rarity: Darling, it was so generous of you to take the time to teach those other creatures about friendship.\nIllusion Rainbow Dash: But if you're going to join us and do something that really makes a difference, we need to know where your loyalty lies.\nIllusion Rarity: You do want to impress us, don't you, Sandbar?\n\nOcellus: [crying]\nSmolder: Huh? Ocellus?\nOcellus: Go away.\nSmolder: We're still in those weird caves beneath the school. We've gotta get out of here. [gasps] Chrysalis! Where's Ocellus?!\nOcellus: It's me! I'm hideous! [crying]\n\nGallus: Hello?!\n[bubbling]\nGallus: Where are\u2014? Whoa!\n[splash!]\nSilverstream: Shhhh! The Storm King will hear you!\nGallus: The Storm King? He was defeated. We're still under the school. This is all just some crazy test.\n[growling sounds]\nGallus: Okay, that's horrifying.\nSilverstream: I can't find any Hippogriffs or seaponies. They must all be captured! Gallus! Get back down here!\n[growling continues]\nGallus: It's not real.\nSilverstream: Yes, it is! He's back, and I'm never gonna see another sunset or fly through a cloud bank or study plumbing! He's gonna take away everything I love! I'm gonna be trapped down here forever!\nGallus: I'm afraid of being trapped, too! I'm scared of small spaces.\nSilverstream: Really?\nGallus: Yeah. And I was stuck in a room that kept shrinking. But I realized I had to face my fear, and I found the way out. This is your test. He isn't really here.\n[growling sounds]\nSilverstream: But what if he is?\nGallus: Then tell him exactly what you think of him.\n[magic zap]\nSilverstream: Uh, hey! Storm King! You're nothing but a big, old bully with a silly name and a goofy crown! You thought you could scare us into doing whatever you wanted! But we learned that together, we're stronger than you! And now that we're rid of you, we're gonna soar through the sky and go on adventures and never give you another thought ever! [stomps]\n[rocks toppling]\nSilverstream: Ha-ha! I did it! I told him!\nGallus: Okay. Heh. Hug time later. W-We still have to get back to the library.\n\nSmolder: You're a changeling. Just change back.\nOcellus: I can't.\n[changeling zap]\nOcellus: Maybe my past was so horrible, it's still inside me just waiting to come out again.\nSmolder: That's ridiculous. That's not who you are anymore. You've changed.\nOcellus: Maybe we can't really change that much.\nSmolder: [muffled] I like cute, silly stuff.\nOcellus: I'm sorry, what?\nSmolder: I like cute, silly stuff! But ever since school started, I've realized that sometimes I kinda don't mind cute stuff.\nOcellus: [laughs]\nSmolder: If a dragon like me can admit she likes tea parties, that's proof we can change. I was gonna invite you to a top-secret tea party with me, but if you want to stay down here...\nOcellus: Oh! No! I want to come!\n[changeling zap]\nSmolder: I thought that might work. Come on, let's go!\n\nSilverstream: Where's Yona and Sandbar?\nGallus: The way out is closing!\nSmolder: We aren't leaving without them!\n[spiders chittering]\nYona: Yona find you guys!\nRest of Young Six: [screams]\nSilverstream: Hey, Yona. Who's your... spider army?\nYona: Yona always scared of spiders. But then Yona meet Spindle.\nSpindle: [chitters]\nYona: Yona realize no reason to be afraid. Spiders and yak friends! So Yona ask new friends to help finding old friends!\nGallus: Do you think your new friends can help us find Sandbar?\nSpindle: [chitters]\nSmolder: Of all the strange things that have happened tonight, that's the strangest, right?\n\nSandbar: Okay, enough! I'm not going anywhere without my friends!\nIllusion Rainbow Dash: So you don't care about anypony but your friends? Are you really that selfish?\nIllusion Rarity: Honestly, you really are such a disappointment.\nSandbar: I've always looked up to you. You would never turn your back on each other, and that's what makes you strong. Now I have a group of friends that I think is every bit as amazing as yours. If I have to give up on them to make you proud, then you aren't the ponies I thought you were. I don't care if I disappoint you. You disappoint me.\n[shimmer!]\nSilverstream: Did you just tell our professors you were disappointed in them?\nSandbar: Something tells me those weren't actually our professors. Besides, they tried to get between me and my friends.\nSmolder: That's all very sweet. Now, can we please get out of here?!\n\n[cracking sounds]\nSandbar: [grunting] You! You're not Headmare Twilight, are you?\nOcellus: [gasps] You're the Tree of Harmony!\nSilverstream: The Tree of Harmony turned into a sparkly version of our headmare to talk to us? Did I miss a chapter in class?\nTree of Harmony: Like all living things, I change as I grow. As I have grown, so have my abilities.\nGallus: I'm a bit rusty on pony history. But since when does the Tree of Harmony trap creatures in a cave with their biggest fears?!\nTree of Harmony: You chose what you saw in my roots, not me.\nSandbar: [gasps] Our friendship got us past our fears!\nTree of Harmony: You were more concerned with each other's well-being than your own. You were strong when your friends were weak. You let each other in and showed that you would be there for each other, no matter what.

And we totally passed!\nCozy Glow: The Tree of Harmony? Here?\nSilverstream: Yeah! Well, below here. Under the school! We found this and went down and met the Tree, and Gallus was all, [imitating Gallus] \"Friendship is not in our nature.\" And the Tree was like, \"Whaaaaat?!\" And it tested us!\nSmolder: Long story short, friendship is in our nature. The Tree said so.\nOcellus: I guess we should tell somepony there's a giant magical hole in the library.\n[clang!]\nOcellus: Or not.\nSandbar: We have to tell our professors about this! They won't believe that\u2014!\nCozy Glow: You can't!\nYona: Why no?\nCozy Glow: Because... it's my fault. You were all getting along so well, and I felt left out. I was jealous. And it upset you so much, the Tree of Harmony had to test you. [gasps] Oh! I'm gonna get expelled for sure! [crying] Please don't tell anypony about this! Especially the professors! Please, please, please\u2014!\nSmolder: Okay! [yawns] I'm actually too tired to do anything right now.\nSandbar: Yeah, but we can't go to sleep. We'll miss the test.\nGallus: [yawns] The test! I almost forgot!\nOcellus: [yawns] We're all gonna fail.\nSilverstream and Yona: [snoring]\nCozy Glow: What if I tell Professor Sparkle I needed help organizing these books, and you were all kind enough to pitch in? I'll get you an extension!\nSandbar: [yawns] Thanks, Cozy. That's nice of you.\nCozy Glow: I'm just so sorry I caused all of this. You're such good friends. I'm sorry I ever doubted you.\nSilverstream: [sleepily] Mmm... No problem... Friendship is... [snoring]\nCozy Glow: You get some rest. Don't give any of this another thought.

This is the first time the map has teamed up the same ponies for a second quest!\nFluttershy: That is special.\nApplejack: Heh. Must be 'cause we're extra good at solvin' friendship problems.\nTwilight Sparkle: I hope so, 'cause it looks like this one might be a little tricky. You're going to the Peaks of Peril.\nFluttershy: The Peaks of... P-P-Peril?!\nApplejack: Aw, it's just a name. It doesn't mean anythin'.\nFluttershy: Like how Cloudsdale is in the clouds and the Crystal Empire's made of crystal?\nApplejack: Fair point. So, what can ya tell us about the place, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Only what Rockhoof told me. Back in his day, nopony knew much about the Peaks of Peril except for the legend on this ancient shield. It says a group called the Kirin used to live there, known for their kindness and truth-speaking.\nApplejack: Now we know why the Map called us.\nTwilight Sparkle: Unfortunately, other creatures also lived there. The Nirik, fearsome beasts of pure fire.\nFluttershy: [shudders] Maybe you should go instead of me, Twilight. [laughs nervously]\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry, Fluttershy.

I suppose I got a little too caught up in the adventure.\nFluttershy: That's all right. If you hadn't come back to get me, I probably would've talked to the squirrels all day.

[to Applejack] You have to ask yes-or-no questions, or they won't answer.\nApplejack: Like talkin' to Angel Bunny?\nFluttershy: Not exactly. I can always tell what Angel is feeling. But these Kirin don't show anything.\nApplejack: Well, how are we gonna solve a friendship problem if none of 'em will tell us what it is?\n\nApplejack: These Kirin are quieter than an apple blossom on snowfall. Still, there's gotta be some way to make 'em speak. [chuckles] Beautiful day, ain't it?\n[beat]\nApplejack: [whinny] Knock, knock!

You've just arrived, and perhaps you're tired or hungry or reflective and want to sleep and eat and journal? Which you should do, of course! But first\u2014 Oh! Oh, what joy to talk with another creature! It's been so long! You must tell me everything about you! There's so much to say, so much to do! Oh, look at me. I'm going on, and you haven't seen\u2014 I mean, have you seen\u2014? W-What am I saying? Of course you haven't.

[gasps] This... is amazin'.\nAutumn Blaze: Oh, you think so, too?! The way the light shimmers off everything, like, like it all suddenly woke up the moment you saw it. And you realize maybe the water and the mountains and the forest and the... yes, the rainbow and the stars and the sky are all looking back at you thinking the same thing? That we are a part of the everything. That maybe there's just one thing and we are all it.\n[beat]\nApplejack: I was gonna say it's pretty. But yeah.\nAutumn Blaze: [hums, sniffs] Mmmm! And this is just the first stop on a journey of amazing things to see, smell, tiptoe through. Oh, I haven't been able to share all of this with anypony in forever! Since they all took that vow of silence. So it's a lot for me to pro-cess. Process? Uh, deal with.\nApplejack: Whoa there. Vow of silence?\nAutumn Blaze: That's, uh... That's why they asked me to leave.\nApplejack: I hope it's not a sore subject, but... you mind explainin' why y'all went quiet in the first place?\nAutumn Blaze: It's a long story.\nApplejack: [sighs] You'd rather not talk about it?\nAutumn Blaze: No.\nApplejack: I-I under\u2014\nAutumn Blaze: [begins singing] I'd rather... siiiiiiiiiiiing!\n\n[Autumn Blaze]\nLa, la-la-la, la-la\nLa-la-la, la-la-la\n\nLa, la-la-la, la-la\nLa-la-la, la-la-la\n\nThe Kirin used to speak and sing\nWe weren't always quiet\nWe told stories and funny jokes\nMy stand-up was a riot\n\nThe Kirin used to speak and sing\nWe weren't always quiet\nWe told stories and funny jokes\nMy stand-up was a riot\n\nBut then one day, a fight broke out\nAnd hurtful words were said\nFlaring tempers were inflamed\nDestruction quickly spread\n\nBut then one day, a fight broke out\nAnd hurtful words were said\nFlaring tempers were inflamed\nDestruction quickly spread\n\nAnd flaming bred from head to head\nIt even burnt our... bread\n\nAnd flaming bred from head to head\nIt even burnt our... bread\n\nSorry, I forgot how much I love rhyming.

You know, after I started talking again.\nApplejack: [gasps] I bet this here's the problem that Fluttershy and I came to help y'all with!\nAutumn Blaze: Really? Who's Fluttershy? Oh! Did you name your shadow? Mine's called \"Silhouette Gloom of the Sundown Lands\".\nApplejack: Right... Well, I'm thinkin' if we just go talk to the other Kirin, we can get 'em to welcome you back proper-like. Maybe even convince 'em to take your cure.\nAutumn Blaze: Oh, yes! Yes, of course! Oh, just one small thing. The antidote from my anecdote? It's gone.\nApplejack: There's no cure left?!\nAutumn Blaze: I used the last of the foal's-breath flowers to make it. And I-I haven't seen them bloom since.\nApplejack: [sighs] Well, this wouldn't be a friendship quest if it was easy. I'm gonna start by gettin' your friends to welcome you back!\nAutumn Blaze: You know, between you and me, I'm not sure she's gonna convince them. [deep voice] Nope! [normal voice] But... [whispering] I hope she does.\n\nApplejack: [panting] Fluttershy! Guess what!\nApplejack and Fluttershy: I figured out the friendship problem! Me, too! Go ahead! [laugh]\nApplejack: Bet that's a problem the Kirin never have.\nFluttershy: [giggles] No.\nApplejack: Anyhow, we gotta get 'em all talkin' again.\nFluttershy: Oh, no-no-no-no-no! We can't ever let that happen!\nApplejack: I thought you said you figured out the friendship problem. Was somethin' lost in translation?\nFluttershy: The Kirin are usually peaceful and kind. But when they get mad, they turn into Niriks, creatures made of fire and vengeance!\nApplejack: Heh. That seemed less scary when it was in a song.\nFluttershy: The last time they all argued, they got so angry, they accidentally destroyed their whole village. So the Kirin decided to make sure it would never happen again.\nApplejack: But that's no reason to stop talkin'.\nFluttershy: Yes, it is! Fire is dangerous, especially in a forest like this. Why, think of all the animals it could hurt.\nApplejack: Not if they don't turn into fire-breathin' Nirik in the first place.\nFluttershy: And how can you be sure that won't happen?\nApplejack: There's gotta be a better way than givin' up all your feelin's!\nFluttershy: Applejack! You're not listening!\nApplejack: 'Cause you're not talkin' any sense!\nFluttershy: Um, what are they doing?\nApplejack and Fluttershy: [yelp]\nFluttershy: [grunts] Maybe they got worried because we were arguing with each other.\nApplejack: Aw, shucks! We were just havin' a normal, civil disagreement! Honest!\nFluttershy: W-Where are they taking us?! [grunting]\nApplejack: To the Stream of Silence! If we hit that water, we'll never be able to talk or feel anythin' ever again!\nApplejack and Fluttershy: [gasp]\nAutumn Blaze: [distorted] Put them down!\n[flames roaring]\nFluttershy: [whimpering]\nApplejack: It's all right. I think I know this one. And she's tryin' to help.\nAutumn Blaze: Well, yeah! Can't have them silence the only friend who'll speak to me.\nFluttershy: She talks?\nApplejack: You have no idea. Fluttershy, meet Autumn Blaze.\nFluttershy: Well, thank you for that... um, wall of fire. But I thought Niriks were dangerous when they're angry. How did you know you could control your temper?\nAutumn Blaze: I didn't. Huh. I guess anger's like other feelings. It's not about having them. It's what you do with them.\nApplejack: And givin' up happiness to keep away anger is no kind o' life.\nFluttershy: I never thought of it that way. I can't imagine not being able to talk to my animal friends.\nAutumn Blaze: Fern Flare, you used to love to laugh at everything. And Rain Shine, you sung the most beautiful harmonies. Don't you miss it?\nApplejack: I know you're worried about fightin'. But friends can disagree without causin' a ruckus.\nFluttershy: Everypony gets mad sometimes. Even Applejack and I argue.\nApplejack: What?! When do we ever argue?\nFluttershy: [clears throat] On the way here? And about the Kirin being silent? And right now!\nApplejack and Fluttershy: [growl, laugh]\nApplejack: We don't always see eye-to-eye. But we never let that get in the way of our friendship.\nFluttershy: And if you're really angry, then take some time away to be a Nirik where it won't hurt anypony.\nApplejack: I-I think they're tryin' to say somethin'.\nAutumn Blaze: Okay, are you hungry? Oh, no. Is some Kirin trapped in a well? Okay, \"baby\". \"Baby fish\". \"Ba\"\u2014 \"Ba\"\u2014 No. \"Baby fish mouth\"? Uh, something? Anything?! [groans] Just write it down! [groans] This is making me furious. Would you excuse me? I'll be right back. [distorted scream] You were saying?\n[beat]\nAutumn Blaze: Ohhhh! You want the cure for the Stream of Silence!\nFluttershy: That's wonderful! Uh, isn't it?\nApplejack: Well, it would be. Except there aren't any flowers left to make the cure.\nFluttershy: Are you sure?\nAutumn Blaze: Oh, beyond sure. Believe me, I've had a lot of alone time lately. I searched the entire forest seventy-three and a half times. Although I wonder if that second half could make a difference.\nFluttershy: Hmm. I wish she'd told us what kind of flowers she's looking for.\nApplejack: They're called foal's-breath.\nFluttershy: I've never heard of that.\n[squirrel chittering]\nApplejack: Uh, Fluttershy? A little help?\n[squirrel chittering]\nFluttershy: [gasps] He says he knows where to find foal's-breath!\nApplejack: Well, what are we waitin' for? Lead the way!\n\nFluttershy: [gasps] That's what foal's-breath looks like?!\nApplejack: Autumn Blaze never would've made it past the Peaks to search here. I owe you an apology.\nFluttershy: Why?\nApplejack: 'Cause if your kindness hadn't made you stop to help the squirrels, we never would've found this here flower.\nFluttershy: And if your honesty hadn't convinced the Kirin to talk, we wouldn't need to find it.\nApplejack: [chuckles] Guess it's a good thing the map sent both of us, huh?\n\nAutumn Blaze: [gasps] You found them?! Where were they?! Tell me everything, and feel free to add complicated descriptions and comedic tangents!\n[beat]\nAutumn Blaze: Oh. Right. First things first.\n[shimmering]\n[Kirin laughing, cheering, singing]\nRain Shine: Autumn Blaze, you have given us a gift. The realization that anger is within us, but it is our choice how we let it out. We would very much like it if you came back to live with us.

[sighs] Your mother was the best dragon I'd ever met.\n\nSludge: [voiceover] The Dragon Lord even picked her to scout for the Great Migration, and-and even though she just laid your egg, we knew she'd have to go. But finding the Migration route could take a lifetime, and you deserved a chance to know your mother. So I went looking for you, carrying your egg to places no dragon or pony has ever been. Past Mount Aris, the abandoned home of the Hippogriffs...\n\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! Did you visit Klugetown?\nSludge: You've been to Klugetown?\nMane Six: [various affirming]\nTwilight Sparkle: Also, the Hippogriffs returned to Mount Aris after we helped them defeat the Storm King.\nSludge: Oh, well, have you heard of the Land of the... Scale Collectors?\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh-uh.\nSludge: [to Spike] Because that's where your mother's trail finally led.\n\nSludge: [voiceover] To a prison world of dragon hunters, where I was forced to choose between surrendering myself or surrendering your egg.\n[clang!]\nSludge: [voiceover, choked up] Of course, there was no way I was gonna sacrifice my boy. So they took me instead, and that's where I'd been ever since.\n\nSludge: Locked up somewhere not even the Princess of Friendship has heard of.\nSpike: Whoa... How did you know I was a boy?\nFluttershy: Whatever happened to Spike's mom?\nRainbow Dash: And how did the egg make it all the way back to Equestria by itself?\nPinkie Pie: Hmm?\nSludge: I wish I had all the answers. [crying]\nSpike: Well, that's all in the past. The only thing that matters now is that we're together. And I'm gonna make up for lost time.\n\nSpike: I hope you don't mind, but I have a list of all the things I always wanted to do with my dad?\nSludge: Mind? Spike, my boy, with you by my side, I feel like we could do anything. What do you want to do first?\nSpike: Well, I've kind of been working on a list for a long time.\n[scroll unrolls]\nSludge: Dude, you want to do all of this?\nSpike: Oh. I mean, w-we don't have to.\nSludge: If you think doing everything on this incredibly long list is gonna fill the hole where your dragonishness should be, then that is exactly what we're gonna do!\nSpike: [gasps]\n\n[montage music]\nGranny Smith: [blows whistle]\nSludge: [chomp, belches fire]\nPinkie Pie: Woo-hoo!\nSpike: Oh, yeah!\n\n[wind whistling]\n[paper tearing]\n[paper tearing]\n\n[oven timer rings]\nSludge: [chewing noisily]\n\nSludge: [gulps]\nSpike: I can't believe we got so many things done. But this is all my stuff. Is there anything you always wanted to do with me?\nSludge: Not really.\n[beat]\nSludge: Uhhh, I mean, uh, I'm happy to do whatever you want. But if I had a castle like this with all this stuff, I'd probably just lay around all day doing nothing like a real dragon.\nSpike: Like a real dragon?\nSludge: Sure! I'm not surprised you don't know any better. Twilight basically raised you as a pony. You're barely a dragon at all.\nSpike: Huh?\n\n[doors open]\nTwilight Sparkle: Hey, Spike! How are things going with Sludge?\nSpike: Honestly, I thought having him around would make me feel more dragonish. But I kind of feel less.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, I'm sorry. I wish I could help.\nSludge: Awww, shucks. [chewing noisily] I guess I shouldn't have said anything about you being more pony than dragon. I just wish we had more in common.\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe you two can come up with ways to turn up Spike's, uh, dragonishness.\nSpike: You think that's something we can do?\nSludge: You know what, son? I think it is!\n\nSludge: Spike, I'm gonna teach you a thing or two about being a dragon. So, listen up, my boy, because I'm only gonna say this once.\n\nLook at this castle where you live\n\nLook at this castle where you live\n\nSpike: It's pretty sweet, right?\n\n[Sludge]\nYou can't be a dragon here\n\nYou can't be a dragon here\n\nSpike: Uh, I can't?\n\n[Sludge]\nLook at these books up on the wall\n\nLook at these books up on the wall\n\nSpike: Hey, I just finished organizing those!\n\n[Sludge]\nThis treasure pile's not right, I fear\n\nThis treasure pile's not right, I fear\n\nTrust me, I got you covered here. You see all this soft pony stuff you're surrounded with? This has got to be the first thing to go.\n\nNothin' 'bout this place says \"dragon den\", there's too much fluff\nAll these fancy robes, toss in a pile\nTake those goblets, dishes, is that gold? Still not enough!\nDe-ponifying might just take a while\n\nNothin' 'bout this place says \"dragon den\", there's too much fluff\nAll these fancy robes, toss in a pile\nTake those goblets, dishes, is that gold? Still not enough!\nDe-ponifying might just take a while\n\nSure, this place is grandiose\nBut to a dragon, it's just gross\nTime we make the lot all disappear\nReality you need a dose\nTo all these ponies, you're too close\nYou just can't be a dragon here\n\nSure, this place is grandiose\nBut to a dragon, it's just gross\nTime we make the lot all disappear\nReality you need a dose\nTo all these ponies, you're too close\nYou just can't be a dragon here\n\nGood job, my boy! But this is still just the beginning!\n\nEach and every dragon has a swagger all his own\nWatch and I'll show you what I mean\nYou can't move like this with so much stuff to weigh you down\nA dragon always keeps it lean\n\nEach and every dragon has a swagger all his own\nWatch and I'll show you what I mean\nYou can't move like this with so much stuff to weigh you down\nA dragon always keeps it lean\n\nLose this! This! Ooh, this is nice!\n\nYour life is soft, your scales are coiffed\nThese pillows, beds, and sheets are washed\nA delight, but it's just not right what's underneath\nEvery dragon must be free\nLook at you, then look at me\nSince when do dragons brush their teeth?\n\nYour life is soft, your scales are coiffed\nThese pillows, beds, and sheets are washed\nA delight, but it's just not right what's underneath\nEvery dragon must be free\nLook at you, then look at me\nSince when do dragons brush their teeth?\n\nHa! Please!\n\nSure, this place is grandiose\nBut to a dragon, it's just gross\nTime we make the lot all disappear\n\nSure, this place is grandiose\nBut to a dragon, it's just gross\nTime we make the lot all disappear\n\nSpike: What do I do?\n\n[Sludge]\nJust grab it all and give to me\nAfter that, then you'll be free\nYou just can't be a dragon heeeeere!\n\nJust grab it all and give to me\nAfter that, then you'll be free\nYou just can't be a dragon heeeeere!\n\nSpike: Ha! You're right! I feel better already!\nSludge: See? What did I tell you? You're very lucky that I found you. Now, go get me some more.\nSpike: You got it! I'm gonna go get you all the cushy pony stuff I've got... Dad.\nSludge: Great! Go get 'em... son!\n\n'Cause this dragon just can't wait to live here\n[sinister laughter]\n\n'Cause this dragon just can't wait to live here\n[sinister laughter]\n\n[knocking on door]\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike? I just thought I'd check to see if you and Sludge had any luck turning up your dragonishness. It's hard not to feel like somehow I let you down all these years.\nSludge: [grunting]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to barge in on ya!\nSludge: [grunts, sighs] Ah, don't worry about it. Mi castle es su castle.\nTwilight Sparkle: Right. Well, I'll just get out of your way.\n[door closes]\n[squeak!]\n[splattering]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh! Spike! I'm so sorry. My morning is not going well. What is all this? Why'd you leave the castle so early?\nSpike: I didn't leave. I spent the night outdoors to get in touch with my dragon side.\nTwilight Sparkle: Outdoors?\nSpike: Yeah! And Sludge asked me to bring him the best breakfast Ponyville has to offer so he can show me how a real dragon would eat it. See you later!\n[door closes]\n\n[doors open]\nTwilight Sparkle: ...And that's why I thought we could use the map to\u2014\nSpike: Hey, gang! Dad was just showing me how a real dragon would act in a throne room.\nSludge: Dragons like to sprawl when they get their claws done. [blows] Now, if you'll all excuse me, it's time for my bath.\nSpike: [sighs] Isn't he the best?\nRarity: I'm not sure that's exactly the word I would use.\nSludge: Uh, Spike? The bath isn't gonna fill itself, son.\nSpike: Be right there... Dad.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm glad you're not spending the night outside again.\nSpike: Oh, I am. I'm just looking for a good bedtime story to read to my dad first.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's nice that you have somepony to show you dragon culture. But are you sure that's what Sludge is doing?\nSpike: What do you mean?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, taking over your room, making a mess of things...\nSpike: [scoffs] That is dragon culture.\nTwilight Sparkle: You never acted like that.\nSpike: That's because you raised me. Now I finally have a chance to see how I'm supposed to be.\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't think you're supposed to be any different than who you are.\nSpike: Maybe you just don't like that I have a real parent now.\n[cracking]\nTwilight Sparkle: That's not true! I'm glad Sludge is here. I-I just wish he wasn't such a\u2014\nSpike: Dragon? Of all ponies, I can't believe you would have a problem with that.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\n\n[splashing]\n[bushes rustling]\nSmolder: What happened to you?\nSpike: Just sleeping outside like we're meant to. It's not like dragons are supposed to live in castles.\nSmolder: I... guess not. But I live in the school. Nothing says we have to live outside.\nSpike: [sighs] I'm so confused. It's been great having Sludge show me how to be a real dragon, but Twilight just doesn't get it.\nSmolder: What do you mean?\nSpike: She can't handle how good at being a dragon Sludge is. Maybe someday, I'll be able to lay around doing nothing as well as he does.\nSmolder: What?\nSpike: Well, not now, of course. I'm too busy bringing him pony stuff so he can show me what a dragon would do with it.\nSmolder: So, Sludge just lays around while you wait on him claw and tail? Uh, dragons are rude and rebellious, but they aren't lazy lumps who take advantage of their kids.\nSpike: Huh. Now I'm really confused.\nSmolder: Me, too. Why don't you tell me everything Sludge said about being a dragon?\n\n[door opens]\nSludge: [chewing noisily] Hey! What's going on, son?\nSpike: Twilight doesn't like having real dragons in the castle, so I told her we're moving out.\nSludge: [coughs] You what?!\nSmolder: Spike! I found the perfect cave where you two can live! There aren't even any comfortable rocks inside!\nSpike: That does sound perfect!\nSludge: No, it doesn't! I-I-I mean, uh, I'm not sure I fully demonstrated all the ways a dragon would live here.\nSpike: But we're not gonna live here anymore, so it doesn't matter.\nSludge: It matters to me! [stammers] I want to make sure you have all the knowledge you need.\nSpike: But I do. Dad, you've already shared so much.\n[singing] This bed is much too soft\nJust take that silk robe off\nWe can't be dragons living here\nSludge and Spike: [straining]\nSludge: Stop! I'm not your father!\nSpike: What?\nSludge: I just said that to get in on this sweet castle life.\nSpike: So... you... pretended to be my dad?\nSludge: Now-now-now-now-now, don't look at me like that, kid. I did what any dragon would do.\nSmolder: No. You didn't.\nSludge: Hey. I saw an opportunity, and I took it. That's what dragons do.\nSmolder: No. It isn't.\nSludge: You know what? I don't need this. I'm out of here! Enjoy lovin' pony town!\nSpike: [sighs]\nSludge: I'm taking this pillow.\nSpike: I can't believe I thought somepony like that could show me how to be anything.\nSmolder: Uh... it must be hard growing up not really knowing who you are.\nSpike: That's the thing. I know exactly who I am. And how I got that way.\n\n[singing] This bed is much too soft\nJust take that silk robe off\nWe can't be dragons living here\n\n[door opens]\nSpike: Um, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. Hi. Where's your father?\nSpike: He's gone. Turns out he wasn't what a real dragon should be after all. He also wasn't my real dad.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Spike. I'm so sorry.\nSpike: I'm the one who's sorry. You were just worried about me, and I lost my temper. Sludge was just a great big phony.\nTwilight Sparkle: I have to say, I'm not surprised. There's no way a dragon like that was related to you. But if you still want to search for your real family, I'd understand if you spent more time in the Dragon Lands.\nSpike: I don't think so. I already know who my real family is.\nTwilight Sparkle: Aww! It's me, right?\nSpike: Mm-hmm! Besides, there's no way I'm living without pillows.\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[thud]\nDerpy: [groans]\nCozy Glow: Thank you for the mail delivery. Have a wonderful day!\n\nCozy Glow: You're new here, right? I'm Cozy Glow, Professor Sparkle's friendship assistant. Welcome to our school! Your first class is just down that hall.\n\nCozy Glow: A seven-letter word for \"teamwork\". Have you tried \"synergy\"?\nSilverstream: That's it! Thanks, Cozy!\nCozy Glow: What are friends for?\n\n[door opens, closes]\nCozy Glow: Good morning, Professor Sparkle!\nTwilight Sparkle: The mail's here already? What time is it?! I'm late for my class's field trip to Cloudsdale! [panting]\nCozy Glow: Don't worry. I asked Professor Rainbow Dash to cover for you.\nTwilight Sparkle: And she said yes?\nCozy Glow: Uh-huh. I told her how busy you are and how much her loyalty meant to you. I also color-coded your teaching schedule by friendship element and catalogued all the magical artifacts in the school. I hope that's okay.\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay? Cozy, that's amazing! You're like my right-hoof pony! I don't know what I'd do without you.\nCozy Glow: [giggles] It's like you taught me. Helping is what friendship's all about.\nTwilight Sparkle: Exactly. And hopefully my class is learning that on their field trip right now.\nCozy Glow: I heard they might do some sightseeing first.\n\n[thunder and lightning]\nRainbow Dash: Ta-da! The Pegasus Weather Factory! Every drop of rain or flake of snow from Cloudsdale comes from there.\n[sounds of awe]\nRainbow Dash: I know, right? Hey! The cool stuff's over here!\nOcellus: Wow! I've never stood on a cloud before!\nStarlight Glimmer: You can't normally. But for our trip, I cast a spell that lets us walk like Pegasi.\n[wind whistling]\nGallus: Hey, Yona! Come check out this view! Unless you're too scared.\nYona: [teeth chattering] Yona not scared! [screams] Now Yona scared!\n[students gasp]\n\n[theme song]\n\nYona: [screams]\n[magic fizzles]\nStarlight Glimmer: [gasps]\n[ponies and creatures gasping]\nRainbow Dash: Come on! We gotta catch 'em!\n[ponies screaming]\nYona: [screams]\nGallus: Gotcha!\nOcellus: It's okay, Yona! You like flying, remember?\nYona: Flying, not falling!\n[thud]\nYona: [kissing sounds]\nStarlight Glimmer: I don't understand. It-It's like my spell stopped working. That's... never happened before.\n\n[door opens]\nStarlight Glimmer: We have an emergency!\nRainbow Dash: The students dropped out of the sky!\nTwilight Sparkle: Slow down. What happened?\nStarlight Glimmer: I cast a spell for our field trip to Cloudsdale, but my magic just failed.\nRainbow Dash: We barely caught everypony in time!\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm glad you're all okay, but I'm sure it's nothing to worry about, Starlight. Maybe you did your spell wrong. Let's take a look.\n[thud]\nTwilight Sparkle: I didn't drop that book.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sarcastically] Maybe you did your spell wrong?\n[thud]\nRarity: Ow!\n[door opens]\nFluttershy: Rarity ran into the door.\nRarity: [sobbing] My magic is go-o-o-one! I even had to use my hooves to coif my tail!\nRainbow Dash: Still think there's nothing to worry about?\nTwilight Sparkle: This doesn't make any sense. Magic can't just disappear. Something has to be causing this.\nCozy Glow: Um, didn't we learn in class about a creature that eats magic? Ter, Tee... Tir-something?\nFluttershy: [gasps] Tirek!\nRainbow Dash: Isn't he trapped in Tartarus?\n[door opens]\nSpike: [gagging]\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike, what's wrong?\nSpike: [gagging, belches, sighs] Thanks. I've never had a letter get stuck before. It's from Princess Celestia! We've all been called to an emergency meeting in Canterlot! Look!\n[magic fizzles]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pretty sure I know what it's about.\n\nPrincess Celestia: Throughout our city, ponies have been reporting tales of their magic failing. Spells going wrong. Potions not working.\nPrincess Luna: Even raising the moon has become difficult. Are there similar troubles in Ponyville?\nTwilight Sparkle: We experienced it first-hoof.\nPrincess Cadance: It's the same in my kingdom. The Crystal Heart seems safe for now, but I worry if this continues.\n[door opens]\n\"Special Delivery\": [panting] Letter for the princess from Star Swirl the Bearded!\nPrincess Celestia: Ah! It is even more terrible than we feared! Magic is disappearing all across Equestria!\n[ponies gasp]\nPrincess Celestia: Star Swirl believes the power will drain from our land in three days. First, unicorn magic and spells will fail.\nStarlight Glimmer: That's what's happening now.\nPrincess Celestia: On the second day, creatures will lose their magic abilities.\nFluttershy: [gasps] Oh, no!\nPrincess Celestia: And finally, magical artifacts will stop working. When the sun sets on the third day, the magic in our world will be gone forever!\n[ponies gasp]\nPrincess Cadance: But why is this happening now?\nPrincess Luna: That's the worst part. We have no idea.\nTwilight Sparkle: Has anypony checked on Tirek?\nPinkie Pie: You mean the big, red, scary centaur who eats magic? Why would we wa\u2014 Ohhhh. Riiiiight.\nPrincess Celestia: If he has found some way to escape his prison or work from within it, he could be responsible for this.\nPrincess Luna: That is the best explanation so far. Somepony should investigate.\nTwilight Sparkle: We'll go.\nRarity: Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no. Not without us, you wo\u2014 Wait. Did you say \"we\"?\nTwilight Sparkle: I've finally learned that it's okay to count on your friends for help. Um, you do want to come, right?\nRainbow Dash: Uh, duh!\nPrincess Celestia: Thank you, all. We will search for ways to protect Equestria in your absence.\nPrincess Luna: Be careful. Tartarus has changed since you were there. It now holds many dangerous creatures, and you won't be able to rely on your magic.\nApplejack: With her friends by her side, she won't have to.\n\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay. I left you my lesson plan, all my student files, and my annotated syllabus notes. If anything goes wrong, get Celestia.\nStarlight Glimmer: Got it!\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe I should just close the school and send my students home.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] Would you go save Equestria already?\nSpike: Okay. Cozy packed us all up for a trip to bad guy central.\nCozy Glow: Don't forget the sandwiches. I marked whose is whose, just in case. [whispering, to Spike] Starlight can't stand mustard.\nStarlight Glimmer: That's so sweet of you, Cozy. But Twilight has asked me to stay here to run the school.\nCozy Glow: Oh. I thought that after what happened last time\u2014\nSpike: Once she's survived Discord, anything else is a piece of cake.\nCozy Glow: [whimpers]\nTwilight Sparkle: Plus, she'll have you to help her.\nCozy Glow: Oh, golly, yes! I promise I'll be the best assistant ever! Come on. We can start working on your substitute headmare plans right now, if you like.\nStarlight Glimmer: Wow. Uh, okay.\nTwilight Sparkle: See? Nothing to worry about. Tell me there's nothing to worry about.\n\n[doors open]\n[students chattering]\nCozy Glow: Good morning, friendship students! I know we're all sad Professor Sparkle is away. But don't worry, because she left me in charge to do things just the way she would.\nGallus: Uh, I thought Starlight Glimmer was gonna be temporary headmare.\nCozy Glow: She was, but she left me this note. [reading] \"I have to go. Twilight needs my help. I know the school is in good hooves with you, Cozy.\" [giggles] Isn't that sweet? We won't let Starlight down, will we?\n[students agreeing]\nSmolder: It's just kind of weird, isn't it?\nCozy Glow: I don't know what you mean.\nSmolder: Like, why'd she change her mind? Why did Starlight write a note instead of saying goodbye to us herself? Doesn't make any sense.\n[students murmuring]\nCozy Glow: [giggles] Oh, Smolder, you forget. We're not scheming dragons. We're ponies. Sounds like somecreature needs to do a little extra friendship homework.\n[students laughing]\nSmolder: [growls]\nYona: Yak not pony either! If Smolder get homework, Yona get homework.\nOcellus: Me, too!\nSandbar: I'm in!\nSilverstream: Yeah! [laughs] Homework party!\n[beat]\nGallus: [groans] Fine.\nCozy Glow: What loyalty. Professor Rainbow Dash would be so proud. You are such good friends. You all are. And I'm grateful because it will be awfully hard running a whole school alone. Can I count on each of you to help me?\n[students cheering]\nCozy Glow: Thank you so much! It's just like our professors taught us. Together, we can get through anything!\n\n[Fly-ders buzzing]\nRarity: [blows]\n[smack!]\nRarity: Ow! Ugh! I have had it with these horrible flies! [whines] I miss my magic!\nTwilight Sparkle: Have you tried using your tail to shoo them away?\nRarity: [gasps] Bite your tongue! It's for decorative purposes only!\nPinkie Pie: Hey! I didn't know we packed green cupcakes.\nFluttershy: Um, we didn't. They must've gone bad without magic to keep them cold.\nRainbow Dash: \"Magic\" this, \"magic\" that. We don't need magic to go on a little hike.\n[thunder]\n[rain falling]\nRarity: You were saying?\nApplejack: You just need to think more like Earth ponies, y'all. Granny's \"Apple Core No-Bite-No-More\"! That'll keep the flies off.\nPinkie Pie: [sniffs] Ugh! It smells just like it looks!\nFluttershy: Even if our food's spoiled, these blueberries are still good to eat.\nSpike: Too bad we can't do anything about the rainstorm.\nRainbow Dash: I can't stop that storm by myself, but I can still help!\n[thunder]\nTwilight Sparkle: I think we have all the magic we need right here. Not that I don't want to get it back. Heh. Let's go!\n\n[students chattering]\n\"Citrine Spark\": Cozy Glow baked our class cupcakes today!\n\"Berry Bliss\": And she made all of us friendship bracelets!\n\"Patty Peppermint\": She's the nicest pony I've ever met.

But if Twilight takes her time coming back, I won't mind.\n[students laughing]\n\n[door opens]\nSilverstream: Finally! We thought you forgot about study club.\nSandbar: Sorry I'm late. Cozy Glow gave our class tickets to a Sapphire Shores concert in Ponyville tonight.\nGallus: You get the feeling Cozy's trying too hard to make us like her?\nOcellus: Or maybe she just wants to help us keep our minds off of how scary it is that magic's disappearing.\nSmolder: I don't trust her. What's she up to behind those big eyes and bouncy curls?\n[clattering]\nYona: And why Cozy pony coming out catacombs so late at night?\nGallus: Let's go ask her.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: This is the only door to Tartarus. The good news is the seal isn't broken, so we know Tirek didn't escape.\nApplejack: Let me guess. You got bad news, too?\nTwilight Sparkle: Last time I was here, I had to use magic to get in. And according to Star Swirl, all unicorn magic was gone by yesterday's sunset.\nRainbow Dash: Maybe he was wrong.\nTwilight Sparkle: [grunts]\n[magic fizzles]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\nPinkie Pie: Don't worry, Twilight. I got this.\n[knock, knock]\nPinkie Pie: Free pizza delivery!\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: Huh. Always worked before. Oh, well.\nApplejack: Did any of y'all pack somethin' that could actually help?\nRarity: These all do magic, but not the kind we're looking for, I'm afraid.\nSpike: How about this?\nTwilight Sparkle: The Key of Unfettered Entrance! Where did you find this, Spike?\nSpike: In your bag. Cozy Glow must've packed it for you.\nTwilight Sparkle: She really did think of everything.\nFluttershy: Um, what does it do?\nTwilight Sparkle: It can magically open any door. And since artifacts like this haven't lost their power yet...\n[whirring]\n[gears clicking]\n[cranking sounds]\n[shatter!]\nTwilight Sparkle: I guess it only works once.\n[door slams]\n\n[cockatrice hisses]\nMane Six and Spike: [gasp]\nApplejack: Cockatrice!\nRarity: Do something, Fluttershy!\nRainbow Dash: Don't look at it! It'll turn you to stone!\n[cockatrice hisses]\nPinkie Pie: I don't feel like stone.\n[boing, boing]\nPinkie Pie: Unless it's really bouncy stone.\nFluttershy: I think he lost his magic, too. All the creatures here must have.\n[low growling]\nTwilight Sparkle: Star Swirl said that would happen on the second day.\nSpike: I know it should make me feel safer, but it just makes me sad. We gotta fix this!\n\n[door opens]\n[chair creaks]\nChancellor Neighsay: Where is Princess Twilight?!\nCozy Glow: Oh, golly. She's away on a quest. I'm watching the school for her.\nChancellor Neighsay: Magic is failing across our land, and she left a foal in charge of this facility?\nCozy Glow: Yes, sir! Is there anything I can do for you?\nChancellor Neighsay: That won't be necessary. Twilight's folly stops here. As of now, I am headstallion. And I have quite a few changes to make.\n\nPinkie Pie: If all these monsters lost their magic, then getting past Cerberus should be easy-peasy!\n[loud thudding]\nRainbow Dash: Look out!\nMane Six and Spike: [scream]\nFluttershy: I'll talk to him.\nCerberus: [growls]\nFluttershy: Um, excuse me, puppy?\nCerberus: [snorts]\nFluttershy: You're a very good guard dog. Yes, you are. But, um, we were wondering if we could get by to check on Tirek.\nCerberus: [slurping]\nApplejack: That looks like a yes.\n[splash!]\nRarity: I'll get you a towel, darling.\nFluttershy: [giggling]\n\nLord Tirek: The Princess of Friendship here for a visit. What have I done to earn the honor of your company?\nTwilight Sparkle: We want answers, Tirek. Magic is disappearing from Equestria.\nLord Tirek: I know. What a waste of such... [slurping] ...mmmm, delicious power.\nRainbow Dash: So you are behind this!\nLord Tirek: Silly filly, if I had all of that magic, you think I'd still be locked up in here? But I might know something about it...\n\nCozy Glow: What are you doing?! Those are Twilight's student files!\nChancellor Neighsay: These aren't. Not anymore. With Equestria under attack, ponies must stand together. Twilight has endangered us all by skipping off on friendship trips while these dangerous creatures run loose.\nCozy Glow: You don't think they're the reason magic is disappearing, do you?\nChancellor Neighsay: Yes, and I came to warn Twilight. But since she is gone, it falls to me to protect you foals from these monsters.\nYoung Six: [murmuring]\nChancellor Neighsay: Did you hear something?\nCozy Glow: It sounded like it came from over there!\n[door creaks]\nYoung Six: [grunt]\nChancellor Neighsay: You again. As I suspected.\n[magic surging]\nYoung Six: [scream]\nChancellor Neighsay: From now on, this school is pony-only! As nature intended.\n\n[door opens]\n[thud]\nChancellor Neighsay: Since you refuse to explain your plot against Equestria and return the magic you stole, you will stay here while I summon your guardians to take you home.\nSandbar: Wait! You were right about them from the beginning, Chancellor. I see that now.\nSmolder: What are you saying?!\nSilverstream: Sandbar?!\nSandbar: I don't want anything to do with creatures that could threaten Equestria!\nChancellor Neighsay: Wisely put, colt.\n[magic surging]\nChancellor Neighsay: Everypony will come to their senses eventually.\n[door closes]\n\n[thud]\n[thud]\n[multiple thuds]\nApple Bloom: [yawns]\n[clatter!]\nApple Bloom: What in tarnation?!\nSandbar: Sorry. I ran out of apples. I need the Cutie Mark Crusaders. My friends are in trouble. Chancellor Neighsay locked them up.\nApple Bloom: Huh? I thought Cozy Glow was in charge.\nSandbar: Not anymore. But you guys are good buddies. If you can convince her to distract Neighsay, I can break out my friends. Will you help me?\nApple Bloom: Do mulberries have seeds?\n[beat]\nApple Bloom: That's a yes.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Where is Equestria's magic going, Tirek? What's making it disappear?\nLord Tirek: If you let me out, I'm sure it will jog my memory. What do you say? I scratch your back, you scratch mine?\nRainbow Dash: How about you tell us what you know or you'll be stuck here forever, because we're out of magic keys and nopony can open the door?\nRarity: Oh, dear. I hadn't thought of that.\nSpike: We're just as trapped as Tirek?\nLord Tirek: [chuckles] What a pity. Well, for you. Sweet revenge for me. It seems my little prot\u00e9g\u00e9's plan worked after all.\nMane Six and Spike: [gasp]\nApplejack: Which little prot\u00e9g\u00e9?\nLord Tirek: Oh, we've never met. We're pen pals. Each letter had so many questions about draining magic.\nPinkie Pie: And you answered them?!\nLord Tirek: I was bored. So I simply pointed my pen pal in the right direction.\n[thud]\nFluttershy: Can't you just tell us your pen pal's name? I mean, since we're stuck here anyway?\nLord Tirek: Oh, why not? The irony is too perfect. Her name is...\n\nSandbar: Cozy Glow! I-I could've sworn I saw her come down this way when she left her office.\n[clang!]\nSandbar and Cutie Mark Crusaders: [gasp]\nCozy Glow: Enjoying yourself in there, Starlight? I'm sorry I had to push you in. But what else could I do? You were going to ruin all my plans.\nSandbar and Cutie Mark Crusaders: [gasp]\nCozy Glow: You might get some company soon, if I can't make that annoying Neighsay back off! [inhales, exhales] All this magic needs time to drain from Equestria before my vortex sucks it to another realm. [giggles] Three days can sure seem like forever, huh? You know, you ponies got it all wrong. Friendship isn't magic. Friendship is power! With Twilight and her lackeys out of my way, all of Equestria will bow to me! The future Empress of Friendship!

My friends are in trouble.\n\nLord Tirek: It seems my little prot\u00e9g\u00e9's plan worked after all.\n\nCozy Glow: The future Empress of Friendship! [maniacal laughter]\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Cozy Glow is behind all of this?!\nLord Tirek: [laughs] I'm not usually a fan of ponies, but draining your precious world of magic so she could trap the six of you was inspiring! [laughs, coughs]\nSpike: Um, there's seven of us.\nTwilight Sparkle: I knew we shouldn't have left!\nApplejack: But Starlight's in charge at the school. If anypony can stop Cozy Glow, it's her.\nLord Tirek: Cozy Glow outsmarted the six of you! I doubt this Starlight stands a chance! [coughs]\nTwilight Sparkle: We have to get out of here. Her students can't handle Cozy on their own.\nRainbow Dash: Then I guess we'll just have to bust our way out! [yells]\n[clang!]\nRainbow Dash: [groans] That didn't work. [groans]\nRarity: Not everything can be solved with brute force. We need magic to escape.\nPinkie Pie: Maybe there's a way to get out without magic. Like a secret lever or a secret button or a secret admirer who knows a secret about you but is all, \"Your secret's safe with me because I put it in Tartarus and I have a key!\"\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm afraid not. The most powerful villains and monsters of all time are trapped here. And without our magic, so are we.\nCerberus: [whimpers, slurps]\nTwilight Sparkle: Unless... These creatures might be losing their magical powers, but there's still a magic that makes up what they are. Maybe we can borrow some of that.\n[cockatrice hisses]\n\n[knocking on door]\n[door opens]\nCozy Glow: Uh, excuse me? Um, Chancellor Neighsay?\nChancellor Neighsay: You might as well get used to calling me Headstallion Neighsay. I plan to be here for quite some time.\nCozy Glow: Gee, it sure is a relief to have somepony in charge, what with the magical crisis going on. And we're all so grateful to you for taking care of those... non-ponies. But doesn't the EEA need you?\nChancellor Neighsay: What the EEA needs is somepony to protect this school from the threats at Equestria's borders instead of gallivanting off on adventures beyond them.\nCozy Glow: Twilight didn't just run off willy-nilly. She left me in charge. I'm her right-hoof mare!\nChancellor Neighsay: Another in a long list of mistakes the Princess of Friendship has made. Rest assured, from now on, this school shall be run according to strict EEA guidelines.\n[door opens]\nChancellor Neighsay: The way it always should've been.\nCozy Glow: Well, that sounds just peachy\u2014\n[door closes]\nCozy Glow: ...Headstallion Neighsay.\n\nSweetie Belle: Cozy Glow did all of this? How? Why?\nApple Bloom: I don't know. But come on, y'all. We gotta get Starlight out of there before she comes back.\nSandbar: Wait!\n[shimmering]\nSweetie Belle: [screams]\nScootaloo: Sweetie Belle!\nSweetie Belle: Help!\nApple Bloom: That's gotta be what's suckin' up all the magic in Equestria.\nSandbar: But if that's true, then Twilight and the others went to Tartarus for nothing. And if all of Equestria's magic's getting sucked up in there, there's no way for them to get back!\nScootaloo: We need to get help!\nSweetie Belle: But Starlight's trapped here, and there's no way to get word to Celestia or anypony else!\nApple Bloom: I guess we're on our own.\n\nGallus: [grunting]\n[door rattling]\n[thud]\nSmolder: Still locked, huh?\nGallus: We gotta at least try to get out.\nOcellus: Why? If Sandbar's turned his back on us, every other pony probably has, too.\nYona: Sandbar not turn his back! Sandbar is our friend!\nSmolder: Uh, did you miss the part where he said he didn't want anything to do with us?\nSilverstream: Maybe he just said that so one of us could be free to snoop around and figure out what's going on.\n[lock unlatches]\nSandbar: I dunno. That sounds too clever for a pony to come up with.\nYona: [gasps, laughs] Yona knew Sandbar was still our friend!\nSweetie Belle: We all are.\nScootaloo: Except for Cozy Glow. That pony is not who we thought she was.\nApple Bloom: She's the one draining magic out of Equestria!\nYoung Six sans Sandbar: What?!\nSandbar: We'll explain on the way. But right now, we gotta get to get to Chancellor Neighsay.\nGallus: Huh?\nSandbar: I know he doesn't like non-ponies. But if we tell him what's going on, he'll help.\n\nChancellor Neighsay: I am sure you are all concerned about the magic situation. But I want to assure you that this institution is safe, despite the absence of your headmare. As your new headstallion, let me be the first to say that the reign of Princess Twilight is over! From now on, this school will adhere to EEA doctrine, as it should have from the start!\n[students murmuring]\nCozy Glow: [claps] Thank you, Chancellor Neighsay, for that rousing speech. I know you're a stallion who truly believes what you say. And when you say this school will be run according to EEA doctrine, I know you mean it. And when you say there won't be any more lessons from the Princess of Friendship at the School of Friendship, I guess you mean that, too.\n[students murmuring]\nChancellor Neighsay: That's not exactly what\u2014\nCozy Glow: But Twilight decided to run her school outside of the EEA guidelines. And even though you tried to stop her, Princesses Celestia and Luna trusted her enough to support her.\n[students murmuring]\nChancellor Neighsay: Well, I-I wouldn't say that\u2014\nCozy Glow: So, since I know you mean what you say, my question is really for the students. Are we going to give the pony who already tried to wreck Twilight's school once another chance to do it?\n[students dissenting]\nCozy Glow: I guess things will have to stay the way Twilight wants them. Which includes leaving me in charge.\n[students shouting]\nChancellor Neighsay: This\u2014! I can\u2014! Just\u2014!\n[door opens]\nSandbar: Okay. So maybe we need a new plan.\n\n[chains rattling]\nCozy Glow: Oh, oh, not too tight. We don't want to hurt the Chancellor.\n[padlock clanking]\nCozy Glow: I'm sure Twilight will know what to do with him when she gets back. Now, back to class, everyone. We let the EEA disrupt our friendship studies long enough.\n[doors close]\nChancellor Neighsay: [grunting] Why are you doing this? I thought you wanted to have somepony in charge of the school.\nCozy Glow: Oh, I do. You just aren't the pony I had in mind.\n[clank!]\nCozy Glow: I can't very well have the EEA running the school if I want to run it myself. Of course, that's just the beginning. You see, if there's one thing I've learned here, it's that friendship is the most powerful thing there is. And as headmare of the School of Friendship, nopony will have more friends than me! Making me the most powerful pony in Equestria! [maniacal laughter]\nChancellor Neighsay: [gulps]\n\n[door opens]\nCozy Glow: [giggling evilly]\nScootaloo: Hey, Cozy Glow! What's so funny?\nSweetie Belle: Are you just happy to be running the school?\nCozy Glow: Oh, I'm just keeping Twilight's seat warm.\nApple Bloom: Still, it's pretty impressive.\nSweetie Belle: Is there anything we can do to help?\nScootaloo: We can hang out with you all day if you want.\nCozy Glow: You know, there is something I need help with.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [cheer]\n[door opens]\n[thudding]\n[rattling]\nChancellor Neighsay: Oh, wonderful. I suppose you've all come to gloat?\nSilverstream: Actually, we've come to undo all these chains and free you!\nChancellor Neighsay: But... But why?\nYona: Now that nasty pony met even nastier pony, maybe nasty pony not be so nasty.\n[screech!]\n[chains rattling]\n[crash!]\nSandbar: Also, we'd kind of like to stop Cozy before she drains all the magic from Equestria.\nChancellor Neighsay: She's behind that as well? I must get word to Celestia and Luna.\nSandbar: How? Without magic, it'll take forever to get to them.\nChancellor Neighsay: While it's true that unicorns have lost their ability to cast spells, the most potent magic in Equestria is housed in our... artifacts. The EEA medallion allows me to travel throughout Equestria. Its magic worked when I chained you up. Perhaps it still has enough to send me to the princesses.\n[magic surging]\nOcellus: I hope he makes it.\nSmolder: I hope he doesn't come back and lock us up again.\nGallus: If he comes back.\nSilverstream: Everything's gonna be fine! Twilight and the others are probably already on their way!\n\nCerberus: [growls, whimpers]\nFluttershy: Um, are you sure there's magic in Cerberus? Clarissa the pig has two tails, and while her singing voice is lovely, I don't think it's magical.\nTwilight Sparkle: We need to try everything if we want to get out of here.\nPinkie Pie: I don't know. Tartarus isn't so bad. I could hang out here for a while!\n[flames roaring]\n[crunch!]\nPinkie Pie: Eh. Maybe not forever though.\nLord Tirek: But that is just what it will be! If my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 has followed my instructions, by sunset tonight, every last vestige of Equestrian magic will disappear into the ether forever!\nTwilight Sparkle: Have you even thought about what losing magic would mean?\nLord Tirek: It means the six of you will be trapped here! Like me!\nSpike: Seven!\nTwilight Sparkle: Exactly. It means you're trapped here. Forever. With us.\n[beat]\nLord Tirek: Uhhhh... I hadn't thought of it like that.\nSpike: So, what do we do, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Dash and Applejack nearly have Cerberus tired out. If Rarity pitches in, I think they can get him to sit still long enough to try what I have in mind.\nFluttershy: I'm sure I can get the other monsters to help. [whispering, to Spike] Besides, I would never call them monsters.\nSpike: What about Tirek? He's probably got some magic, too, right?\nPinkie Pie: Leave him to me.\nRarity: [to Cerberus] Down!\nCerberus: [low growl]\nFluttershy: Okay, everyone! Time to show Equestria that you aren't monsters! You're wonderful, mystical creatures!\nPinkie Pie:\nI know it's not your birthday, so\nYou get a party, even though\nWe'll sing and dance from one to ten\nAnd then we'll do it all again!\n[blows] More tea, Princess Pudding Rock? [high-pitched voice] \"Oh! Don't mind if I do!\" [laughs] I can do this all eternity.\nLord Tirek: Fine! I'll help you leave! Just please stop!\nPinkie Pie: Tirek's in!\n\nI know it's not your birthday, so\nYou get a party, even though\nWe'll sing and dance from one to ten\nAnd then we'll do it all again!\n\nApple Bloom: It's just so excitin' to have a foal our age runnin' things. We should have an ice cream social every day!\nCozy Glow: That's a splendid idea, Apple Bloom. But to tell you the truth, the thing I need help with most is cleaning.\nSweetie Belle: Say no more. Just take us around the school and show us everything you want cleaned.\nCozy Glow: Well, actually, you could start right in here.\nScootaloo: It looks pretty clean already.\n[door slams]\nCozy Glow: Do you three think you can fool me?! I know a diversion when I see it!\n\n[rocks crumbling]\nYona: Uh, why pony lead us back down here?\nSandbar: We obviously can't handle Cozy on our own. But we can't just sit around and wait for help. So, there's one more prisoner I think we should free.\nSilverstream: Ooh! I guess Starlight! Is it Starlight?\nYona: Counselor pony, come out! We need help with nasty pony!\nSandbar: She can't talk to us from in there. We'll have to figure a way to get her out.\nGallus: Hey! This is just like chapter twelve in \"Kanthaka's Facts and Artifacts\" from Twilight's class!\n[beat]\nGallus: What? I've been studying. Finals are coming up, you know?\nOcellus: Actually, I remember that, too! Cozy must've linked these artifacts to act like a mystical magnet, attracting all the magic in Equestria into that orb.\nSmolder: So, we can shut it down by yanking one of these things out, right?\nOcellus: Sure, though that would probably cause a magical feedback loop and destroy the whole school!\nCozy Glow: Destroy the School of Friendship?! Oh, dear! Chancellor Neighsay was wrong about a lot of things, but I guess he was right about all of you!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: All right. Is everypony ready?\nRarity: [to Cerberus] Sit! Good! [to Twilight Sparkle] I can't say for how much longer.\n[cymbals crashing]\nPinkie Pie: All eternity!\nLord Tirek: Yes, by all means, please! Just get on with it!\nTwilight Sparkle: [clears throat]\nPinkie Pie: There's your cue, you evil centaur, you.\n[magic surging]\nTwilight Sparkle: [grunting]\n[magic zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: That's it! I think it's working!\n[doors creaking]\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on! I don't know how long I can hold it!\nRainbow Dash: [to Cerberus] Good boy!\nFluttershy: [to creatures] Bye, friends. Hopefully, we'll be able to turn you all back into your normal, wonderful selves soon.\nPinkie Pie: [to Lord Tirek] Thanks for the assist, your redness!\n[zoom!]\n[doors creaking]\n[thud!]\nPinkie Pie: Yay! Twilight did it!\nTwilight Sparkle: I couldn't have done it without all your help.\nRarity: I'm not sure we did!\nTwilight Sparkle: No!\nApplejack: Tirek said all of Equestria's magic would be gone at sunset.\nTwilight Sparkle: Without magic, there's no way we'll get back to the school in time!\nFluttershy: What does that mean?\nTwilight Sparkle: It means... we've failed!\n\nCozy Glow: After everything Twilight's done for you, why would you want to destroy her school?\nGallus: We don't! You're the one using these artifacts to drain magic from Equestria!\nCozy Glow: Me?! We all just saw you with your claws all over them! [gasps] It all makes sense. These creatures want magic gone from Equestria because it's the only thing ponies have that they don't!\nOcellus: Technically, there's a magical component when Silverstream and I transform.\nYona: And Yona's friends' friendship is magic! Twilight said!\nCozy Glow: And you repay her by sending her to Tartarus on a wild goose chase so you could destroy everything she built! [gasps] They've even trapped Starlight in that-that thing! We have to defend this school!\n[students shouting]\nSandbar: No! No, don't listen to her!\n[Young Six and students shouting and grunting]\n[thud!]\nGallus: [screams]\nSmolder: Gallus!\nRest of Young Six: [grunting]\n[cracking]\n[vortex swirling]\n\"Citrine Spark\": They just sacrificed themselves trying to save their friend. Professor Dash always said there's nothing more loyal than that. Shouldn't we try to save them?\nCozy Glow: They brought this on themselves. There's nothing we can do.\n\"Berry Bliss\": That doesn't seem very generous. Or kind.\nCozy Glow: Yeah, yeah. The Elements of Harmony are very important. They're just not applicable in every circumstance. And with magic gone from Equestria, I'm not even sure the Tree of Harmony will be as helpful as it once was.\n[shimmering]\nCozy Glow: What's happening?!\n\"Berry Bliss\": They're glowing like the Elements! I think the Tree of Harmony saved them!\nGallus: Guess our friendship is pretty magical after all.\nOcellus: Hurry!

Now Twilight and her ridiculous friends can escape from Tartarus!\n[teleportation zap]\nCozy Glow: I mean... Yay! All my friends are safe!\nApplejack: You can drop the act, Cozy Glow! Your pen pal Tirek told us all about how he helped you suck up all that magic!\nTwilight Sparkle: But I still don't understand why.\nCozy Glow: [growls] Why?! Because friendship is power! You might be the Princess of Friendship, but as headmare of this school, I can collect even more friends than you!\n[students murmuring]\nTwilight Sparkle: You're the one who doesn't get it, Cozy. Friendship is powerful, but power isn't why you make friends. I'm sorry I couldn't teach you that.\nGallus: Well, you taught us.\nSilverstream: You can't let one bad apple make you think you failed.\nSandbar: And we never could've stopped her if we hadn't learned what you taught us about friendship.\nCozy Glow: Honesty? Loyalty? Generosity? Blah-blah-blah! I can make more friends without using any of them! And if I can't do it here, I'll do it somewhere else!\n\"Patty Peppermint\": Yeah... I don't think so!\n\nChancellor Neighsay: [sighs] I'm glad you're back in charge of the School of Friendship, Princess.\n[door opens]\nChancellor Neighsay: It's clear to me now that there is nopony better suited for the job.\nSpike: [belching]\nTwilight Sparkle: What's going on?\nSilverstream: Hi, Headmare Twilight! We're just practicing for graduation!\nSpike: [belching]\nTwilight Sparkle: Graduation?\nGallus: Now that we've saved Equestria, we figure we're done with school.\nTwilight Sparkle and Chancellor Neighsay: [laugh]\nTwilight Sparkle: Saving Equestria is nice, but I'm afraid it'll take more than one semester to learn all there is to know about friendship.\nSpike: [belches] Told ya.\nYoung Six: Awwww...\nChancellor Neighsay: Your headmare is right. I thought friendship was something only ponies should share with each other. But you all taught me how wrong I was. I suppose true friendship can take a lifetime to understand.\nTwilight Sparkle: If it were easy to learn, we wouldn't need a school.\n[crash!]\nApple Bloom: [yelps] We held her off as long as we could!\nScootaloo: But she locked us in this closet!\nSweetie Belle: What happened?! Is everything all right?! Where's Cozy Glow?!\nAll except Cutie Mark Crusaders: [laugh]\nTwilight Sparkle: Everything worked out just fine.\nPrincess Celestia: As for Cozy Glow, I can assure you \u2014 where she's going, she won't be causing any more trouble.\n\nCerberus: [whimpers]\nLord Tirek: Of course it's boring here now!

I mean, if you think about it, there hasn't been a single villain that we couldn't defeat.\nTwilight Sparkle: Phew!\n\nQueen Chrysalis: One day, you'll see! I will defeat Twilight Sparkle and her friends! [cackles] And they will pay for stealing my kingdom!\n[magic zap]\n[whoosh]\n\n[scraping]\nCozy Glow: Psst, Tirek!\nLord Tirek: It is Lord Tirek. And what is it now?\nCozy Glow: I just wanna make sure you can see my best friends rock sculpture from over there!\nLord Tirek: [groans]\n[whooshing]\n[crumbling]\n\n[drip]\n[magic noises]\n[whirling]\n\nQueen Chrysalis: Lord Tirek!\nLord Tirek: A changeling? [to Cozy Glow] See? She gets it.\nQueen Chrysalis: Chrysalis, queen of the changelings! Or at least I will be, when I'm restored to my rightful place! Why did you summon me? What do you want?!\nCozy Glow: [yelps] Oh, golly! We didn't bring you! I thought you freed us from Tartarus!\nQueen Chrysalis: Tartarus? Whoever pulled you from there must have been somepony very powerful indeed.\nKing Sombra: [laughs]\nQueen Chrysalis: King Sombra! You have returned? Why did you bring us here?\nGrogar: He didn't.\n[whoosh]\n[thump]\nGrogar: It was I. You may call me... Grogar.\nQueen Chrysalis and Lord Tirek: [gasps]\nQueen Chrysalis: The Grogar?\nLord Tirek: I thought that you were a legend!\nKing Sombra: I've heard of you.\nCozy Glow: Who?\nGrogar: I assure you, I am very real. And you have all been brought here as part of my plan to rid Equestria of Twilight Sparkle and her friends once and for all. [laughs]\n\nCozy Glow: I am so sorry, but the name 'Grofar'? It just doesn't ring any bells.\nGrogar: Grogar! I have been away too long if my name no longer strikes fear into the heart of one so tiny. Perhaps a demonstration of power is in order?\n[magic zaps]\nLord Tirek: [kisses] Grogar is ancient and extremely powerful. The land that would become Equestria was a mere collection of farms and pastures until he declared himself emperor of all he saw. I remember hearing tales of his tyranny when I was young.\nKing Sombra: I have also heard of the first Emperor of Equestria. The \"Father of Monsters\".\nGrogar: I gave life to the foulest of creatures and allowed them to run wild, taking what they wanted and destroying the rest. My reign was a glorious, fear-soaked epoch of darkness in Equestria.\nQueen Chrysalis: Ha! Until Gusty the Great rose up and banished you.\nGrogar: That fool believed taking my bell would defeat me! But she only weakened me temporarily.\nCozy Glow: Um, Tirek is really old \u2013 [to Tirek] no offense, you look great \u2013 [to Grogar] but if he knew about you when he was young, we have super different ideas about what \"temporarily\" means.\nGrogar: Silence! I've spent millennia gathering power, biding my time, waiting for the perfect opportunity to seize control of Equestria! And watching all of you. I've seen each of your humiliating defeats at the hooves of six puny ponies. And do you know why they've always bested you?\nQueen Chrysalis: Because they cheat!\nLord Tirek: Because they are annoyingly lucky.\nCozy Glow: I'm just a kid, so...\nGrogar: It is because they work together. Where one is weak, another is strong, and thus unified, they are a formidable force! But we shall use their own strategy to defeat them.\nQueen Chrysalis: What are you suggesting?\nGrogar: I suggest nothing. I demand that you join me, and together, Equestria will be ours!\nKing Sombra: I don't do \"ours\". I only do mine. I will take back the Crystal Empire on my own, and I will destroy any pony who gets in my way!\nGrogar: Such confidence. Go! Try to take back your kingdom. I shall send you there myself. If you prevail, you may keep it. But when you fail, you will submit to me!\nKing Sombra: And if I refuse this deal?\nGrogar: Then I shall return you to the darkness from which you were summoned.\nKing Sombra: Fine! But this is a waste of time, as I will crush those who defy me. I will defeat all who get in my way! I'm\u2014\n[whoosh]\nGrogar: I advise the rest of you to prepare to work together!\nCozy Glow: Well, working together sounds an awful lot like making friends, so... you two are in luck, because I know all about that!\n[twang]\n\n[knocking]\nStarlight Glimmer: Twi! You in here? With the school closed for the summer, I didn't think anypony would be here\u2014\n[paper rustling]\nTwilight Sparkle: So much to do, not enough time! No! I already did that! Wait, no, I didn't! Uggggh, not enough time!\nSpike: [hushed] Help! She's spiraling! We're at the \"my plan needs a plan\" stage of a total Twilight meltdown!\nStarlight Glimmer: [hushed] Oh, got it. [normal] Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Did I write down \"eliminate redundant lists\" on my School of Friendship to-do list or my personal to-do list?\nStarlight Glimmer: Twilight!\nTwilight Sparkle: Gah! Starlight! Oh, good, you're here! I need to talk to you.\nStarlight Glimmer: Okay...\nTwilight Sparkle: Hang on, I had \"talk to Starlight\" written down on one of these. Just let me find it so I can cross it off! [worried noises]\nStarlight Glimmer: Wow, you are \"Twilight-ing\" hard.\nTwilight Sparkle: You say \"Twilight-ing\", too? Well excuuuuse me! This is the first time I've ever been asked to run a whole kingdom!\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, you're right, you're right. [chuckles] So, what did you want to talk to me about?\nTwilight Sparkle: Ah, here it is! I wrote it down. [reading non-stop] Starlight, you have blossomed into one of the strongest, smartest, most caring ponies I know, and I can't think of anypony better to leave in charge of my castle and the School of Friendship! So what do you think?\nStarlight Glimmer: What?! You want me to take care of the castle and run the school?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes?\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh... I can't! I'm not ready! Remember what happened the last time you left me in charge?! And now you want me to do it permanently?! What if I don't do the right things?! [hyperventilates] What if\u2014?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight, get a hold of yourself! You've risen to every challenge you've ever faced. You can do anything you put your mind to. You've got this.\nStarlight Glimmer: Hah! And so do you. See what I did there? You just said everything you need to hear.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sarcastic laugh] Nice try. But running a school and running a country are two very different things. Now, if you don't mind I have seven thousand, four hundred, and thirty-two things to take care of before I become the new ruler of Equestria!

But if you're gonna be the ruler of Equestria, you may want to work on your penmanship. This looks like it says, \"Cadance sent an emergency message. Sombra's back, and he's taking over the Crystal Empire.\"\nTwilight Sparkle: That's exactly what it says!\nRarity: But... But how is that possible?! I thought the Crystal Heart had dispelled him into the ether!\nTwilight Sparkle: I have no idea! But he's back, and it's up to us to save the Empire and my family!\nFluttershy: Shouldn't somepony tell Celestia and Luna?\nDiscord: Ooh, good point! One of us should probably loop in the real rulers of Equestria.\nTwilight Sparkle: No. If we're going to run Equestria, we'll need to handle things like this on our own.\nDiscord: Oh, Twilight! Could this mean that you finally have the confidence to ascend to the throne like the princesses believe you can?\nTwilight Sparkle: Maybe? Unless you'd consider taking care of Sombra for us?\n[beat]\nDiscord: Oh, no-no-no-no! You're absolutely right! You need to learn how to handle these things on your own. Ta-ta!\n[magic zap]\nApplejack: Handlin' things on our own is all well and good, but last time we defeated Sombra with the Crystal Heart.\nSpike: What if he has it already? How are we gonna stop him?\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] With the Elements of Harmony! With those, we can defeat anypony! Even Sombra!\nDiscord: Ah, no-no-no. You didn't need the Elements the last time you defeated Sombra. And I'm not sure that using them still counts as \"handling things on your own\".\nTwilight Sparkle: My family is in danger. I'm not taking any chances.\nRainbow Dash: She's got a point.\nDiscord: Ugh, fine.\nPinkie Pie: What's his problem?\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight, can you stay here and-\nStarlight Glimmer: [cutting off Twilight] -take care of the school? I've got you covered.\n\n[teleportation zap]\n[magic twinkling]\n[teleportation zap]\n\nKing Sombra: [chewing]\n[magic zap]\nKing Sombra: It's cute that you think that will do anything.\nPrincess Cadance: It might not, but they will!\nPinkie Pie: Cavalry's here!

How disappointing.\nPrincess Luna: Equestria was in your care, and you let it be destroyed!\n\nKing Sombra: You should all surrender! Nothing can defeat your own fears!\n[magic sounds]\nTwilight Sparkle: We didn't need to defeat them. We just needed to face them long enough to distract you!\n[crystal cracking]\nKing Sombra: Nooooo!\n[magic zap]\nShining Armor: [mockingly] It's cute that you think that'll do anything.\n[magic zap]\n[explosion]\nKing Sombra: [growls] You may have won the battle, but I shall win the war!\n[magic zap]\nSpike: Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo!\nRainbow Dash: We totally just wiped the castle with that guy!\nShining Armor: Thanks, Twily.\nPinkie Pie: That was fun!\nApplejack: And easy.\nRarity: As magical battles go, that was a cakewalk.\nPinkie Pie: Mmm... Cakewalk...\nRest of Mane Six: [giggle]\nTwilight Sparkle: We did handle this pretty well. On our own.\nSpike: Does this mean...?\nTwilight Sparkle: I still don't feel like I'm one hundred percent ready, but will I ever?\nApplejack: Knowing you? Nope.\nTwilight Sparkle: I have you guys, and we have the Elements. And together, we've never failed. We'll be okay.\nRest of Mane Six and Spike: [assorted cheering]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Once again, Equestria is safe.\nFluttershy: What should we do to celebrate?\nPinkie Pie: I vote for a cakewalk!\n[rumbling]\nApplejack: What's goin' on?\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know!\n[cracking]\n[shattering]\nMane Six: [gasps]\nKing Sombra: [laughs evilly]\n[to be continued]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[Previously on My Little Pony]\n\nPrincess Celestia: It is time for us... to retire!\nTwilight Sparkle: And you want me to take your place?!\nPrincess Celestia: With the help of your friends, of course.\n\nGrogar: You may call me...

And I think I know exactly where I'll start.\nApplejack: Don't you dare say it!\nKing Sombra: Your sweet, little hometown.\nRarity: You leave Ponyville alone!\nKing Sombra: Or what? Without your Elements, it would be so easy to control you.\n[magic noises]\nMane Six: [yelps]\nKing Sombra: But there's no point. My conquering Ponyville is already your greatest fear! [laughs maniacally]\nMane Six: No!\nFluttershy: What do we do?!\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't know! The Tree of Harmony grew the Elements! It kept the Everfree Forest under control! And now it's gone. Sombra will take over Equestria, and it's all my fault! I knew I wasn't ready to take the princesses' place, but I never thought I'd mess up this badly!\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: What are you looking at me for?\nRainbow Dash: This is usually when you say something funny to lift our spirits.\nPinkie Pie: Sorry. Nothing about this is funny to me.\nRarity: [tears up] I'm sorry.

We're doomed?\nKing Sombra: Of course you are. I can't believe it's taken you this long to realize it. Now, how shall I eliminate all this clutter in my throne room?\nMane Six: [growl]\nDiscord: [weakly] Listen to me. You don't need me. You don't need the princesses, and you certainly don't need the Elements. [coughs] Fluttershy, you will always be kind. Applejack, you will always be honest. Rarity, you'll always be generous. [ragged breath] And Rainbow Dash will be loyal as can be. Pinkie will always bring laughter wherever she goes. And Twilight... [coughs] you are and always will be the embodiment of magic. You lost sight of what's in front of you. You're here, together, willing to give everything you've got for Equestria. Nothing and nopony can ever take that away from you, because that's who you are.\nKing Sombra: [laughs] It's going to take more than a sentimental speech to save you.\nTwilight Sparkle: Discord's right. We've proven time and time again that the real magic is the six of us working together! With these girls by my side, I'm not afraid of you! I'm not afraid of what you can do or how much power you have!\nKing Sombra: You should be.\n[magic zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: You may knock us down, but we're gonna get back up again!\n[magic zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: And again!\n[magic zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: And again!

And it's red. And it has one of those little umbrellas. And two cherries. No, no, actually, make it three. And maybe, uh... some donuts?\nPrincess Celestia: I see you've made yourselves at home.\nTwilight Sparkle: Celestia! Luna! I know what you're going to say. I should have called on you as soon as I knew how dangerous it was. A good leader knows when to ask for help, and I didn't. And because of me, the Tree of Harmony was destroyed. Equestria deserves somepony much better than me as its leader.\nPrincess Celestia: You're right.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\nPrincess Celestia: About one thing. A good leader knows when to ask for help, but a great leader has the courage to admit when they've made a mistake and the strength to make it right. Today, you've proven to me beyond any doubt that you will be a great leader.\nTwilight Sparkle: Will be?\nPrincess Celestia: Luna and I have decided it may have been a bit unfair to thrust this upon you without giving you the time you need to prepare.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Thank goodness! I really wasn't ready!\nDiscord: Not ready?! So, Twilight's not taking over?! This was all for nothing?! I pretended to be very hurt and gave one of the most convincing speeches of my\u2014?!\nFluttershy and Twilight Sparkle: Pretended?!\nDiscord: Of course! You don't think some \"would-be king\" could actually hurt the Lord of Chaos, do you? Anyway, as I was saying, I pretended to be very hurt to convince you that you didn't need anything but yourself to be the incredible leader I know you can be. And now it's not happening?!\nPrincess Celestia: It will. But when she's ready.\nDiscord: How can she not be ready?! What a waste of a perfectly wonderful speech! Ugh! Honestly, I don't know why I even bother.\nRarity: Ugh! So he could have ended the whole Sombra thing whenever he wanted?\nFluttershy: But he didn't, because he cares.\nRainbow Dash: That's Discord for ya.\nApplejack: He sure has a weird way of bein' supportive.\nPinkie Pie: Super odd dude.\n[magic zap]\nDiscord: I heard that!\n[magic zap]\nMane Six, Princess Celestia, and Princess Luna: [laughing]\nPrincess Luna: Also, truth be told, Celestia and I had fun today fighting side-by-side with Star Swirl for our home.

You're officially the first non-Pegasus Wonderbolt!\nSilverstream: Really?! That is such an honor! I don't know how to thank you, Professor Dash!\nRainbow Dash: Easy! You're kicking off our show right now! So get up there and make me proud!\n[whoosh!]\nSilverstream: Wait! I don't have my uniform!\nOcellus: Silverstream! Somehow, I missed a class all year, and the final is today! If I don't pass, I can't graduate!\nYona: [screaming]\n[beat]\nYona: [sighs]\nOcellus: Whoa. That was weird.\nSilverstream: And that's even weirder.\nSmolder: [sips, sighs] Hmm? Uh, this isn't mine!\nGallus: [screams] Make it stop! Make it stop! [hyperventilating] Huh?\nSandbar: [panicked noises]\n[magic sounds]\nTree of Harmony: Good. You have all answered my summons.\nSilverstream: Wait. You mean this isn't my dream?\nYona: Friends must be dreaming together!\nGallus: More like a nightmare!\nSandbar: I know, right? How do I pick just one? They all look so good!\nSmolder: That's your version of a bad dream?\nOcellus: But why did you bring us here, Headmare Twilight?\nTree of Harmony: I am not Twilight. I am merely the messenger. You all must hurry. The Tree of Harmony needs you.\n[smash!]\n[magic sounds]\nYoung Six: [gasp]\n\n[theme song]\n\n[squeaking]\nSpike: [clicks tongue] Lookin' good.\n[teleportation zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike! I have horrible news!\nSpike: What's wrong? Is the Crystal Empire under attack again?!\nTwilight Sparkle: What? No! We only have twenty highlighters! And they're all orange! How will everycreature color-code their notes?!\nSpike: I'm pretty sure you're the only one that does that.\nTwilight Sparkle: Still, twenty isn't enough for the new school year!\nSpike: We got plenty of time to order more. The friendship students won't be back until\u2014\n[doors open]\nSpike: Uh, now?\nYona: Whoa, whoa, whoa!\n[thud]\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, this is a surprise. Why are you all here so early? Did I send out the wrong back-to-school date?!\nSmolder: Oh, we're not here for school.\nSandbar: Yeah. We're back 'cause the Tree of Harmony called us here.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\nGallus: Don't feel bad it didn't reach out to you. We kinda have a special connection with it after last year.\nTwilight Sparkle: But the Tree couldn't have called you. It's gone! Sombra destroyed it!\nYoung Six: [gasp]\nSpike: Mmmmaybe next time, ease in with those truth bombs.\nSandbar: W-What about the Elements of Harmony?\nTwilight Sparkle: Those are gone, too.\nOcellus: But doesn't that mean the Everfree Forest will take over Equestria?!\nSpike: We've got that part under control, and Sombra won't be coming back, so... some good news, right?\nSilverstream: Can we see the Tree ourselves? Or what's left of it?\nTwilight Sparkle: As long as you promise to stick together. The Castle of the Two Sisters isn't the safest place, as you may remember.\nYona: Yona not scared of puckwudgies anymore! Friends save whole school from evil Pegasus!\nSpike: [aside, to Twilight] She does have a point.\nYoung Six: [laughing]\nOcellus: Yes!\n\nYoung Six: [gasp]\nGallus: How could this happen?!\nOcellus: [gasps] If only we hadn't gone home for summer break. Maybe we could've saved the Tree.\nSmolder: [huffs] I wish that Sombra guy was still around, so we could teach him a lesson!\nYona: That not bring back Tree. Or Elements of Harmony.\nSilverstream: [gasps] Wait! We all saw and heard the Tree in our dream, right? How could it talk to us if it was really gone? Maybe if we close our eyes and think really strong friendship thoughts, the Tree will get better!\nSmolder: Eh, I've heard worse suggestions.\n[music]\n[beat]\nSandbar: [loud whisper] Is it working?\nYona: No.\nOcellus: I guess the Tree really is gone.\nGallus: Then we need to do something to honor it!\nSmolder: Ah, good idea, Gallus!\nSandbar: Hey, maybe that's why the Tree called us! It must've used the last of its magic to make sure we'd come here and keep its memory alive!\nOcellus: It did say it needed us.\nThorax: Ocellus!\n[transformation noise]\n[thud]\nThorax: There you are! The hive has been worried sick! Why did you leave without telling us? The last time you and your friends did that, it almost brought our kingdoms to war!\n[transformation noise]\nOcellus: Uh, sorry, Thorax! It was an emergency!\nThorax: Well, next time, ask before you run off. Now, come on. Let's go home.\nSmolder: Wait! She can't leave! We have a... dragon quest!\nThorax: But she's not a dragon.\n[transformation noise]\nThorax: You know what I mean.\n[transformation noise]\nYona: This quest for all Yona friends! Need to help Tree!\nSandbar: And it might take a while.\nSilverstream: Can we stay, Headmare Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, as long as you get permission from your kingdoms, I suppose it's all right.\nGallus: You want that permission in triplicate, or is one enough?\n[beat]\nGallus: What? I like to be prepared.\n\n[dragons yelling]\nSmolder: [straining] Yah!\n[dragons cheering]\nSmolder: [laughs]\n\n[montage music]\n\nYona: [snorts]\n\n[knocks on door]\nGrampa Gruff: [coughs]\n[door slams]\n\n[music continues]\n\n[inaudible dialogue]\n\nSandbar: Hey, you're back! Great! Since I live locally, I figured I'd do a little cleaning up while you were gone. Give us a head start, you know?\nRest of Young Six: [gasp]\nGallus: Sandbar, where's the Tree?\nSandbar: I got rid of it, to make room for a memorial.\nSmolder: You did this?!\nSandbar: Uh, yeah. That's what you guys were thinking, right?\nSmolder: [smack]\nSilverstream: So not.\nOcellus: How can we remember the Tree if it's totally gone?!\nSandbar: Oh, it's not gone. Look! I planted a new tree. [grumbles]\n\nOcellus: Sandbar, you know that's not the same tree, right?\nSandbar: But it's a symbol, y'know?\nYona: Pony heart in right place.\nGallus: [growls] That doesn't matter! This cave was supposed to stay exactly the same so that future creatures could come visit and experience the memory of the Tree!\nSandbar: Sorry, everycreature. I thought I was helping.\nSmolder: The Tree of Harmony is a huge part of Equestrian history. If we're gonna honor it, we need to do better than that.\nSilverstream: Yeah! Like with lots of artwork that represents the symbolism and deep emotions of the Tree!\nGallus: No! It should be a museum with all the Tree's history and artifacts.\nSmolder: Or a really big and imposing monument, so everycreature knows how powerful the Tree was!\nOcellus: I think we should turn this cave into a place for creatures to reflect on the Tree's true gift \u2013 the Elements of Harmony.\nSmolder: Boring.\nSilverstream: I like my idea better.\nSandbar: What's more perfect than another tree?!\nOcellus: What would Headmare Twilight want?\nGallus: Yona! You've been awfully quiet. Which idea do you like best?\nYona: Yona like when friends not argue. M-Maybe friends listen to each other and... make plan together?\n[beat]\nRest of Young Six: Naaaah.\nYona: [groans]\n\nSandbar: [to sapling] Hey, little guy. Need a drink?\n[water sprinkling]\nGallus: Step right up! Walk this way! Welcome to the one, the only, magical Tree of Harmony Museum! Come, see the birthplace of the Tree! Grown from the tears of a basilisk and tended day and night by pony magicians! This is truly one of the wonders of Equestria!\nYona: Uh, Gallus? None of that actually true.\nGallus: So? Honoring the Tree means giving it a story that creatures will care about.\nSandbar: It already has a great story!\nGallus: Yeah, but mine makes more sense.\nSandbar: Whatever. Can you just keep it down? My sapling doesn't like the noise.\nGallus: Good! It doesn't belong in the Tree's memorial anyway. [to tourists] And if you think this is great, just wait until you see the mystical Cave of Harmony!\n\n[scraping]\nSmolder: [straining]\n[thud]\n[crunch]\n[whoosh]\nYona: What dragon doing?\nSmolder: [straining] Making a memorial statue of the Tree. When creatures see this, they'll be super impressed!\nYona: Uh, look like rock, not tree.\nSmolder: I'm not finished yet! And, honestly, I'm kinda having a hard time remembering what the Tree looked like. I can't believe I'm already forgetting.\n\n[painting noises, splats and splashes, etc.]\nSilverstream: Hmmm... Needs more loyalty.\n[splash]\nSilverstream: Careful, Yona! It's not dry yet.\nYona: What hippogriff painting?\nSilverstream: It's the Tree, silly! See? These are the emotions its loss made me feel, dancing with the representations of Elements of Harmony!\n[beat]\nSilverstream: Maybe I should label it.\n[creaking]\n[splash]\nOcellus: Oops! Sorry!\nSilverstream: Oh, no! Brown isn't an Element of Harmony!\n[splashing]\nOcellus: [straining] Thanks, Yona! This fountain is heavier than I thought.\n[thud]\n[wind chimes]\n[transformation zap]\nOcellus: It's for creatures to look at as they honor the Tree's memory in quiet thought and contemplation. I got some help and guidance from the counselor at our feelings forum back home. Only positive energy will bloom here.\nGallus: Wait! You can't go yet!\nTourists: [gasps]\nGallus: There's a whole puppet show of the time the Tree tested us in the catacombs under the School of Friendship! [to Smolder] Hey, stop! You can't bring that hunk of junk into my museum!\nSmolder: It's not for your museum. It's for my tree memorial.\nGallus: So leave it outside!\nSmolder: It belongs in here!\n[crunch]\n[crash]\n[splash]\nSilverstream: [gasps]\n[rumbling]\nYona: [gasps]\n[crash]\nGallus: Uh-oh.\nSilverstream: [gasps] What did you do?!\n\n[water flowing]\nOcellus: My meditation garden is ruined! Why couldn't you've been more careful?!\nGallus: This never would have happened if you had all just listened to me!\nSandbar: And made the Tree some kind of roadside attraction?! Uh, no thanks!\nSilverstream: [hyperventilating into paper bag] Headmare Twilight is gonna be so mad when she sees what you guys did to the Cave of Harmony!\nSmolder: Yeah, like some rainbow art project was better?\nSandbar: Not cool!\nSilverstream: It's impressionism!\nOcellus: I'm just glad the Tree isn't here to see this.\nSmolder: This is all your fault!\nGallus: I give up!\nYona: [grunts] Quiet! [stomps] Friends doing this the wrong way. All remembering Tree of Harmony for what Tree was, not what Tree is!\nSmolder: You mean 'gone'?\nYona: No! Yona mean even though Tree not here here, Tree here. In hearts. Tree made friendship even closer.\nOcellus: That's right! We ran away to be together right above this spot! The Castle of the Two Sisters!\nSandbar: And later on, the Tree tested us to show us we're stronger as a team!\nSmolder: It did call us all here.\nSilverstream: [gasps] You mean the Tree of Harmony lives on in our friendship!\nGallus: Wow. I can't believe we just got schooled by a yak.\nYona: Yaks know things not forever. That's why smash and rebuild.\nOcellus: I think we took care of the smashing part.\nGallus: Then maybe we should start building. Together?\nSmolder: Just one problem. We still haven't decided what we should do for the Tree.\nYona: Yona have idea.\n[clanking]\nOcellus: The Tree! Where did you find it?!\nSandbar: Oh, I didn't move it too far.\n[beat]\nSandbar: It was kinda heavy.\nGallus: And you're just mentioning this now?\nYona: What important is that Yona bring back branches so friends can rebuild!\nSmolder: Rebuild what, exactly?\nSilverstream: Ooh-ooh-ooh, I know! Something that represents what the Tree is! The gateway to our friendship!\nYona: Yes! What ponies call it? Club... home?\nGallus: A treehouse!\nOcellus: [gasps] That's a great idea!\nSmolder: I know the Tree would've liked that!\nYona: Uh-huh!\n[transformation zap]\nSandbar: [straining] Help me lift this piece!\n\n[Silverstream]\nWe celebrate our friendship\n\nWe celebrate our friendship\n\n[Ocellus]\nWe celebrate the tree\n\nWe celebrate the tree\n\n[Sandbar]\nThe memories inside us\n\nThe memories inside us\n\n[Young Six]\nWe'll build for all to see\n\nWe'll build for all to see\n\n[Smolder]\nThe tree brought us together\n\nThe tree brought us together\n\n[Ocellus, Silverstream, and Gallus]\n(Brought us together)\n\n(Brought us together)\n\n[Smolder]\nAnd even though it's gone\n\nAnd even though it's gone\n\n[Ocellus, Silverstream, and Gallus]\n(Even though it's gone)\n\n(Even though it's gone)\n\n[Gallus]\nOur monument of friendship\n\nOur monument of friendship\n\n[Rest of Young Six]\n(Of friendship)\n\n(Of friendship)\n\n[Young Six]\nCan make the gift live on\n\nCan make the gift live on\n\n[Ocellus]\nA piece from me, a piece from you\n\nA piece from me, a piece from you\n\n[Silverstream]\nWe'll use the tree and we'll make do\n\nWe'll use the tree and we'll make do\n\n[Gallus]\nIf things don't fit, there's lots of glue\n\nIf things don't fit, there's lots of glue\n\n[Young Six]\nFriends don't quit in the end\nAnd together, we'll see this through\n\nFriends don't quit in the end\nAnd together, we'll see this through\n\n[Smolder]\nIt's hard to say farewell\n\nIt's hard to say farewell\n\n[Sandbar]\nTo something you hold dear\n\nTo something you hold dear\n\n[Silversteam, Sandbar, and Ocellus]\nBut goodbye isn't forever\n\nBut goodbye isn't forever\n\n[Young Six]\nAs long as we are here\n\nAs long as we are here\n\nThe tree is in our memory (ahh-ahh-ahh)\nIts roots have grown deep in our hearts\n(Deep in our hearts, deep in our hearts)\nIts branches raise our spirits, together we're all bound\nForever it stands, lost but now it's found\n\nThe tree is in our memory (ahh-ahh-ahh)\nIts roots have grown deep in our hearts\n(Deep in our hearts, deep in our hearts)\nIts branches raise our spirits, together we're all bound\nForever it stands, lost but now it's found\n\n[Smolder]\nSo lift a beam and build it strong\n\nSo lift a beam and build it strong\n\n[Silverstream]\nWork as a team, it won't take long\n\nWork as a team, it won't take long\n\n[Yona]\nHey, Silverstream, I think that's wrong\n\nHey, Silverstream, I think that's wrong\n\n[Silverstream, Gallus, and Yona]\nWe'll live the dream and sing our song\n\nWe'll live the dream and sing our song\n\n[Young Six]\nAnd make the tree something all can see\nIn a place where we belong!\nSandbar: Well?

The spirit of the Treehouse would have perished without your selfless deeds and caring. Whenever you seek solace, come here. Your friendship, and the friendship of future generations, will always be safe within these walls.\n[magic zap]\n[door opens]\n[teleportation zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: I felt a burst of magic all the way over at the school! Is everycreature okay?\nSilverstream: A little confused, but definitely okay!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Where did this come from?\nSmolder: We were kinda gonna ask you the same thing.\nSpike: It looks like part of the Tree of Harmony. But how? I thought it was destroyed!\nOcellus: It was. But when we used the broken parts to build something new, this happened.\nTwilight Sparkle: The Tree has always been good at surprises. When Star Swirl planted the Tree's seed, he didn't even know what it would grow into. I guess the Tree is still alive, changing and adapting to be whatever Equestria needs.\nGallus: A cool place to hang out?\nTwilight Sparkle: Something tells me this is more than that. It seems the Elements of Harmony may still be with us in their own way.\nSpike: [sighs] That's actually really reassuring.\nSilverstream: But why did the Tree need our help to become something new?\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm not sure. If I had to guess, I'd say your friendship is more powerful than you know.\nYona: Oh, Yona know. Yona just need to remind friends.\nSpike: So, who's gonna give us the tour?\nYoung Six: [umm-ing and uhh-ing]\nTwilight Sparkle: [giggles] Why don't we all go in together?\nYoung Six: [laughing]\n\nAnd make the tree something all can see\nIn a place where we belong!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nSpike: Twilight! Look at this scroll I just got!\n[fanfare plays]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Do you know what this means?\nSpike: Uh-huh!\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, I don't. What's so exciting about a toy crown?\nSpike: [laughs] This is no \"toy crown\". It's the hard-won helm of the Sibling Supreme!\nTwilight Sparkle: When Shining Armor and I were small, we competed over everything.\n\n[wind blowing]\n[montage music]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [voiceover] To keep it friendly, our parents gave us gold stars every time we did something special. Sharing... getting good grades... even telling a really funny joke. And at the end of each week, we'd add up the stars. The sibling with the most would win the Crown of the Sibling Supreme\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and bragging rights \u2014 'til next time.\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Guess that explains your love of charts and so much else.\nSpike: I always wanted to be Sibling Supreme one day.

[scoffs] What grudge? Just because you've had it for way longer than you should have and I never got a chance to win it back!\nPrincess Celestia: With the return of Sombra, Princess Luna and I felt it was time to reinforce the castle's defenses.\nPrincess Luna: I said we could do it ourselves, but some ponies are a bit stubborn.\nPrincess Celestia: So I asked our old Captain of the Guard to handle the job.\nShining Armor: I've taken the security here to a whole new level. The only thing I need now is somepony to test it.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] You want me to break into Celestia's castle?\nShining Armor: If you can get past my defenses, steal the crown, and get out, you'll be Sibling Supreme forever!\nTwilight Sparkle: For-ev-er...\nShining Armor: But! If you fail, I keep the crown.\nTwilight Sparkle: Deal! Wait. Are you sure this counts? Mom and Dad aren't giving us any stars.\nPrincess Celestia: I will represent their authority. And thank you, Twilight. Your help will reveal if there are any holes in our security.\nPrincess Luna: [nickers]\nShining Armor: And there aren't. I've designed a multi-tiered, impenetrable, triple-backed-up line of defense.\n\nShining Armor: [voiceover] The castle is surrounded by shards of Queen Chrysalis' throne. Thanks to Star Swirl, its anti-magic powers are now tuned to stop anycreature from using a spell to get inside. You can't fly in, either.\n[fans whirring]\nShining Armor: [voiceover] Giant fans keep anycreature from flying too close to the castle.\n[bird squawks]\n[bricks clink]\nShining Armor: [voiceover] Plus, the entrances to the tunnels below the castle have been sealed, so there's no underground access. And even if you could get in \u2014 which you can't \u2014 I've doubled the ranks of security. Ponies protect every hallway and door, which can only be opened with royal guard medals.\n\nShining Armor: Even if you brought an army, the throne room is the safest spot in Equestria. I rigged a floor trap to activate at the slightest touch.\n[ka-chunk!]\nShining Armor: But say you avoid the floor \u2014 still no luck, because I've employed nature's alarm system.\n[geese honking]\nSpike: Geese?\nShining Armor: You can hear their honks all the way in Ponyville.\n[goose honks, snaps]\nShining Armor: Plus they bite. [nervous laugh]\n[goose honks]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: So that's what we're up against.\nApplejack: Whew. That's a barrel and a half of obstacles. Plus a bushel and a peck of impenetrability.\nRarity: And all of this to win some fillyhood competition with your brother?\nTwilight Sparkle: It's more than that! Okay, it's exactly that. And to protect Celestia's castle!\nFluttershy: If it means that much to you, Twilight, we're in.\nPinkie Pie: I was already in! Come on, who doesn't want to hang with geese?!\nRainbow Dash: Of course we'll help. But how?\nSpike: Shining Armor may have come up with some great security, but he'll never guess Twilight's plan.\nTwilight Sparkle: We play to our strengths and defeat all of the security measures. That way, if one of us fails, the others will still have a shot at getting the crown. Pinkie, you'll distract the guards with a surprise party.\nPinkie Pie: Yes, sir, Twilight, sir!\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack, you'll buck your way into the sealed tunnels. Rainbow Dash, if anypony can outfly those wind turbines, it's you. Rarity, you'll sew us guard costumes so we can sneak past security. Then Fluttershy will disable the throne room alarm by charming the geese.\nSpike: [belches]\n[poof!]\nSpike: It's from Shining Armor. [reading] \"Dear Twily, hope your idea isn't just...\" [indistinct muttering] Tunnels? He guessed your whole plan!\nTwilight Sparkle: What?! Pinkie party, Rarity costumes... \"Signed, the future Sibling Supreme\"?! Oh, come on! [grumbles]\nRarity: Twilight, darling, nopony knows you better than your own brother.\nTwilight Sparkle: So you're saying I should give up?\nRarity: I'm saying your brother will win. No matter how brilliant your plan is, no matter how many variations you try, it will be something your brother expects, and he'll always win! Unless... when the perfect chance comes along, you do something he can't expect. Then you'll win.\nSpike: You've been practicing that speech, haven't you?\nRarity: A little bit. It felt like I rushed. Did I rush it?\nApplejack: Absolutely not.\nFluttershy: Oh, no.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah, it was fast-ish.\nRarity: We have to do the opposite of what Shining Armor expects. Therefore, Twilight cannot mastermind the plan. But I can!\nApplejack: That's... definitely unexpected.\n\nRainbow Dash: Uh, how is you making a break-in plan the opposite of Twilight doing it?\nRarity: Because my plan is for each of us to devise our own unexpected part of it. Allow me to demonstrate.\n[magic sounds]\n[harp flourish]\n\n[indistinct talking]\n[film noir music]\n[silence]\nRarity: We're looking for a pony with information.\n[zoom!]\nRainbow Dash: We got questions, and you're gonna serve us up some answers, juice jockey!\nRarity: Where is the secret entrance to the passages under Canterlot Castle?\nServer Pony: Shining Armor sealed 'em all. There's no secret entrance.\nRarity: There's always a secret entrance!\nRainbow Dash: So make like a glass of O.J. and spill!\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, ooh, ooh!

That tickles! [laughs]\nPinkie Pie: [laughs]\n\n[beat]\nPinkie Pie: What?\nApplejack: How about somethin' a little more down-to-earth? Like, I distract the guard ponies with a farewell performance by my alter ego, famous country-western superstar Apple Chord!\nTwilight Sparkle: I didn't know you had an alter ego. And why would she be giving a farewell performance?\nApplejack: Well, it's a long story.\n\nApplejack: [voiceover] Back on the farm, playin' music was about makin' her family smile. Word of her talent spread, and soon, Apple Chord was playin' real shows.\n[crowd cheering]\nApplejack: [voiceover] The more she played, the bigger those shows got.\n[crowd cheering]\nApplejack: [voiceover] But she missed playin' for her family... So one day, she gave it all up. Seein' her family smile was all she ever wanted from her music.\n\nApplejack: Of course, Apple Chord could come out of retirement for a farewell concert this one time.\nRainbow Dash: Wait. Did you just make all that up, or did that actually happen?\nApplejack: Um...\nRarity: Doesn't matter. It's perfect. Fluttershy? Spike?\nFluttershy: Well, I guess the opposite of what I'm good at is... [gasps] ...being in small spaces.\nSpike: I always wanted to be a super-spy. Is that the opposite of anything?\n\n[metal clanging]\nSpike: Special Agent Fluttershy, target detected below.\nFluttershy: It's almost too easy.\n[Mission Impossible-esque music]\n[laser sounds]\n[explosions]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Mm-mm.

I'm dropping you two off as soon as we're close to the fans! Then I'm going into space!\n\n[thud]\nShining Armor: You're up to something, Twily.\nTwilight Sparkle: Nope. Just looking at the flowers.

And a one, and a two, and a\u2014\nPinkie Pie: [screaming]\nApplejack: [quietly] A distraction's a distraction.\nTwilight Sparkle: Where's Spike and Fluttershy? Did they make it into the castle?\nPinkie Pie: They jumped out right before the balloon went [blows raspberries] but that's all I could see without being in space, where I didn't get to go!\nTwilight Sparkle: Let's hope Rarity and Rainbow Dash had better luck.\n\nRarity: What's this? Closed?!\nBeauDe Mane: Oh, the seedy juice joint is always closed around this time.\nRarity: Then how are we meant to shake down ne'er-do-wells for information?!\nBeauDe Mane: What sort of information do you need?\nRainbow Dash: Um, the location to a secret entrance to the passages under Canterlot Castle.\nBeauDe Mane: You mean that one?\nRarity: Yes, thank you. That will do nicely.\nRainbow Dash: Zephyr Breeze?!\nRarity: Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho, darling, this couldn't be more perfect!\nRainbow Dash: How is this perfect?!

The mares love a pony in uniform, am I right?\nRainbow Dash: Not really. I mean, eh, totally. Why don't you step into the light so I can see how... ugh... handsome you look in it?\n[film noir music]\nRarity: [grunting]\nZephyr Breeze: I told the sarge that gold kinda clashes with my aura, but apparently, they aren't big on input. Still, I totally managed to rock the look, don't you think?\nRainbow Dash: Yep. You're real guard material.\nZephyr Breeze: I'm part of the castle team now, so I'm basically\u2014 Whoa! We got a swooner! [seductively] It's good you're finally being honest with your feelings for me, Rainbows.\nRainbow Dash: [gags] Blech.\nZephyr Breeze: The truth is such a gift. Like, I had to follow my bliss to see guarding is my calling. Like, look at me go. I'm gonna walk over here, and I go whoo! Over there! And I go, \"Yeah!\" and sometimes, I just stand like this and look real cool, and I go down the hallway and go, \"Unh, unh, unh, unh, unh!\"\n\n[glass scraping]\nSpike: [gasps, sighs]\nFluttershy: [hushed] We'll have to glide to the throne. No flapping.\n[goose grunts]\nFluttershy: [gasps]\n[geese honking]\n[trapdoor opening and closing]\n[door opens]\nPrincess Luna: [distant] Sister! Another false alarm from Shining Armor's guard geese!\n[door shuts]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: We should have heard by now! Something must have gone wrong!\nPinkie Pie: Probably several somethings. [inhales, blows air]\nTwilight Sparkle: No lookout, no distraction, and no word from the ponies inside! I'm starting to think this whole operation might be a giant flop!\n\n[geese honking]\n[scratching]\nFluttershy: [hyperventilating] Oh, no!\nSpike: Gee, Fluttershy, I thought your whole small spaces thing was just part of the plan to be unexpected.\nFluttershy: Once, I got trapped in the Castle of the Two Sisters, and Angel Bunny and I were separated! Now whenever I'm in a tiny room, it's all I can think about! I was so worried he felt alone and forgotten!\nSpike: [sighs] I know that that's like.\nFluttershy: What do you mean?\nSpike: I was always excited to be a part of Twilight's and Shining Armor's rivalry, like I was their little brother. But they never really thought of me that way.\nFluttershy: I know they both have a special place in their heart for you, but sibling dynamics are hard. Trust me.\nSpike: Right. Zephyr Breeze.\nFluttershy: Honestly, he could learn a lot from you about being a little brother.\n[rumbling]\nRarity: I am sick of being lost in these slimy corridors, too! But you shouldn't pull every lever you come across! Half of them are traps!\nRainbow Dash: And the other half might open a secret passage to the castle!\nRarity: It's not worth the risk! Oh, hello, Spike. [to Rainbow Dash] Even if we did find our way back to the castle, we'd still have all of those guar\u2014 Spike? Fluttershy?!\nRainbow Dash: Uh, what are you guys doing down here?\nSpike: We, uh, kind of fell through the floor.\nFluttershy: I don't think our plan is working.\nRarity: We've both hit dead ends. Perhaps we should return to the outside and reevaluate.\n[mice squeaking]\nRarity: Eugh!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [hyperventilating]\nSpike: Psssssst!\n[metal squeaking]\nTwilight Sparkle: What are you all doing out here?\nRarity: In retrospect, our plan might have been too unexpected.\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Every part of it failed?! Oh, now I'll never get the crown!\nSpike: Maybe we should go back to doing things the Twilight way.\nTwilight Sparkle: You mean the totally expected way?\nSpike: It may not be a surprise, but you have a pretty good record for planning things.\nTwilight Sparkle: Then I guess it's worth a try. Thanks, Spike.\nSpike: What are little brothers for?\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay! You all know what to do!\n\n[music]\n[balloon inflating]\n[pop!]\n[slide whistle]\n[guards chattering]\nRarity: At least one part of our expected plan worked unexpectedly.\n[door opens]\n[whooshing]\nZephyr Breeze: To be fair, it was never made specifically clear to me what \"guarding\" actually means, so this is on you.\nApplejack: I'm strong, Twilight, but not even I can buck through solid rock.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's why I brought a specialist.\n[tapping]\n[chalk drawing]\n[joints cracking]\n[crunch]\n\nRarity: [deep voice] Next shift. You're on break.\n[whoosh]\n[thud]\n[door opens]\n[geese honking]\nFluttershy: You've been glaring so hard. Who wants a feather massage?\n[gesse quiet]\n\nSpike: We mapped this out when we got lost down here. The lever to the secret hallway entrance should be... here.\n[click]\n\nRainbow Dash: I can't believe this worked!\nSpike: I guess sometimes the best plan is the one you expect!\nTwilight Sparkle: All I have to do now is fly over and take the crown, and I'll be Sibling Supreme forever!\nShining Armor: Not exactly.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, come on!\nShining Armor: Gotta admit, it was unexpected for you to do everything exactly how I thought you would. But you should know by now there's no way to beat the true Sibling Surpreme!\nPrincess Celestia: I am sorry, Twilight, but it looks as though Shining Armor has truly won the crown.\nSpike: That's the thing about looks. They can be deceiving.\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike?!\nShining Armor: How in Equestria did you do it?!\nSpike: Come on. You two don't think you have the only sibling rivalry. I had an inside pony help.\n[dramatic music sting]\nSpike: It wasn't hard to miss there were some disagreements on the whole security thing.\n\nPrincess Luna: [flashback] I said we could do it ourselves, but some ponies are a bit more stubborn.\nSpike: [voiceover] So, while Shining Armor went on and on about his improved security measures, Luna and I struck a deal. She put Zephyr in charge of the catacombs and helped keep Celestia out of the castle hallways. Once Luna was on board, I just had to do my part and make sure we stuck to Twilight's plan so we'd all get to the throne room at the same time. I knew Shining Armor would let it play out until the last possible second. Then, while everyone was distracted by his gloating, all Luna had to do was float the crown over to me.\n\n[beat]\nPrincess Celestia: [clears throat] [forced] I, uh, apologize, for not listening to your concerns, sister. It seems we need to make adjustments to account for threats inside the castle as well as out. If you agree?\nPrincess Luna: [forced] If you think it's worth discussing.\nRainbow Dash: So, if Twilight and Shining Armor failed, who gets the crown?\nSpike: [sighs]\nTwilight Sparkle: The true Sibling Supreme. Spike.\nSpike: Huh?\nShining Armor: The little brother we've always had.\nMane Six: Awww...\n\n[heist music over credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[zoom]\nSpike: Whoa!\n[thud!]\nSpike: Twilight, mail's here!\n[doors opening]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\n[squeak]\nTwilight Sparkle: Are you all right?\nDerpy: We just had a really heavy delivery today.\nSpike: Is it a deluxe set of special edition Ogres & Oubliettes figurines that I'm totally surprised by and have been hinting that I need forever?\nDerpy: Well, it's for Twilight.\nSpike: Awww...\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you.\nDerpy: You're welcome!\nTwilight Sparkle: Huh. It's from Princess Celestia.\nSpike: [belches] So is this. Really? She couldn't have put it into the box?\nTwilight Sparkle: [reading] \"My dearest Twilight, I have been conducting a thorough cleaning of the castle, and I came across a few items of yours in your old room. I thought you might want them back.\" I didn't even know I'd left anything! Awww, look! Remember this? It's the macaroni picture frame Cadance helped me make when I was a filly!\nSpike: [quietly, sarcastic] Who could forget a masterpiece like that?\nTwilight Sparkle: My G1 Star Swirl figure! And some of my favorite school scrolls! And here's my extra extra credit report on \"The Impediments of Using Magic in Everyday Chores\"! Ha! Still so true!\nSpike: Is my Smash Fortune comic in there? I've been looking for that for years. Whoa, whoa!\n[thud]\nSpike: [muffled] Or this.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!\nSpike: What's wrong? It just looks like an old library book.\nTwilight Sparkle: Exactly! It belongs to the Canterlot Library! That means it's... overdue!\n\n[theme song]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: You don't understand, Spike! I have a perfect library book return record!\nSpike: [clears throat] Had a perfect record.\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans] I've never turned in a book even a minute late! And this one has been overdue since I left for Ponyville!\n\n[stamping]\nDusty Pages: Make sure you bring this one back on time. We've got a long waiting list of ponies who can't wait to read it.\nTwilight Sparkle: I promise I won't let you down!\nDusty Pages: Oh, of course, you won't, dear. If there's anypony I can trust to take care of a book, it's you, Twilight Sparkle. After all, you still hold the \"Best Book Borrower\" title.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oooh! I hope I do forever!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Spi-ike! Quick, find me that old copy of Predictions and Prophecies. What's that for?\nSpike: Well, it was a gift for Moon Dancer, but...\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: And then Celestia sent me to Ponyville, and I forgot all about this! Dusty Pages prided herself that no books were damaged or lost on her watch, and I failed her! I failed myself!\nSpike: I take it we're going to Canterlot?\n[zip!]\nSpike: [groans] The sooner, the better, I guess.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps]\n[leaves rustling]\nSpike: Uh, why are we hiding? Don't you wanna return your book?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes. But what if somepony sees me in there? I'm the Princess of Friendship. Everywhere I go, ponies recognize me. I'll stick out like a sore hoof.\nSpike: [incredulously] Princess Twilight Sparkle in a library? Stop the presses!\nTwilight Sparkle: A late book is a big deal, Spike. What if Dusty Pages revokes my library card? Or bans me from ever entering the building again?!\nSpike: Don't you already have most of those books in your collection at home?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes, but the ones in there have a special Canterlot Library-y smell!\nSpike: You sniff books?\nTwilight Sparkle: You don't? I used to live in a library. If I'm not a good example of proper book borrowing behavior, then what kind of princess am I?\nSpike: One that makes mistakes like everypony else. Trust me. Once you return that book, you'll feel way better.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thanks, Spike. Let's go!

So good to see you!\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\nLibrarian Pony: Need some recommendations from the new release section?\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Is that the new edition of Mooncurve's Seven Theories on Bending Time? I have been waiting for the release sin\u2014 Uh, I mean, uh, no books today! [chuckles] Thanks!\n[ponies gasp]\nTwilight Sparkle: But I do need to speak with Dusty Pages about a... [clears throat] sensitive matter.\nLibrarian Pony: Dusty who?\nTwilight Sparkle: [nervous laugh] Dusty Pages? The head librarian? She's worked here forever.\nLibrarian Pony: I'm sorry, princess. I don't know her. Now, was there some other way I can help the library's Best Book Borrower?\nTwilight Sparkle: [nervous giggle]\nSpike: [hushed] Just ask where to return an overdue book! It's no big deal! It happens all the time!\nTwilight Sparkle: [hushed] Not to me it doesn't! [sighs] Fine. Fine! Oh, no! I didn't even think about the late fine! A book out this long will probably cost a thousand bits!\nSpike: She\u2014 I mean, we have an overdue book.\nLibrarian Pony: [laughs] Well, that's no problem at all. In fact, it happens all the time.\nSpike: See?\nLibrarian Pony: I'll just find it in the card catalog. Uh, number one-eight-nine-oh-five, got it! [laughs] Oh, wow. Yeesh. I haven't seen a book this late in... well, ever. [clears throat] You need to go and see First Folio in the Grossly Overdue Book Return Office for Ponies Who Should Know Better.\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't pull any punches with those names, do you?\nSpike: And that office would be...?\nLibrarian Pony: In the basement. [whispering] Because of the shame.\n[thud]\n\nSpike: Whoa. [strains] Looks like nopony ever goes down here.\nTwilight Sparkle: Nopony except undependable rule-breakers who deserve all the horrors this hallway holds!\nSpike: And faithful dragon companions. Uh... hey! It looks like First Folio left a note on the door!\nTwilight Sparkle: \"Abandon hope, all ye who enter\"?\nSpike: [reading] \"Out to lunch on Restaurant Row.\" Guess we'll have to try back later!\nTwilight Sparkle: No! I can't wait another minute to return this book! In the time it took us to get there, I racked up another... seventeen bits in late fees! We're going to lunch!\nSpike: Good, 'cause I'm starving!

Can we at least get takeout?!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Tell me if you see any librarian-type ponies.\nSpike: Twilight, we tried this at three other restaurants already!\nTwilight Sparkle: And my late fines are already up another twenty-six more bits!\nSpike: [mock-sobbing]\nPretzel: Waiter, we're ready to order.\nSpike: Oh, uh, I'm not actually\u2014\nPretzel: Three samosas, two curry specials... Do you think that's enough for the two of us?\nSpike: Hm. Well, I would probably order some naan as well. For the table?\nPretzel: Sounds great.\nMoon Dancer: Twilight? Is that you?\nTwilight Sparkle: Moon Dancer! How've you been? I'm just visiting. No real reason. Heh.\nMoon Dancer: Well, it's good to see you! I'm just meeting my friend, First Folio, for lunch. Do you want to join us?\nTwilight Sparkle: First Folio?! Yes! I mean, thank you.\nFirst Folio: Princess Twilight, good to meet you! Did you know your picture is still up in our library as the Best Book Borrower?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah... I was hoping I could talk to Dusty Pages about that.\nMoon Dancer: Oh, Dusty Pages left the library moons ago. Didn't you know?\nTwilight Sparkle: Mm-mm.\nFirst Folio: Oh, I heard she was forced to leave. It's so sad. She loved the library.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait. Forced to leave?\nFirst Folio: Yuh-huh, uh-huh, yeah. She had a perfect librarian record. Until one careless pony didn't return a book, ruined it all.\nMoon Dancer: Are you okay, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: [nervously] Uh-huh. Would, uh, you excuse me?\n[whoosh]\n[spinning]\nSpike: That's why you only order spicy if you can take it. Twilight, what's wrong?\nTwilight Sparkle: Dusty Pages isn't working at the library any more because I didn't return this book! Spike, I think I got her fired!\n\n[brake skids]\nSpike: Twilight, the library is that way!\nTwilight Sparkle: Change of plans. We're going to Dusty's house. She used to invite me over for tea all the time.\nSpike: But what about your late fees?\nTwilight Sparkle: They're not as important as making things right.\nSpike: Wait. So you're not going to return the book?\nTwilight Sparkle: No. Dusty Pages is. It's my fault she lost her job. So if I give her the book, she can get her old job back. It'll fix everything!

No surveys, no petitions, no free literature...\n[thud]\nTwilight Sparkle: No problem. I'm just looking for somepony who used to live here. I'm pretty sure this was her house.\nMeathead Pony: Dusty Pages?\nTwilight Sparkle: Yes!\nMeathead Pony: Hold on. She moved to... Silver somethin'. Shoals, Seas, Surfer, whatever. When you find her, give her this.\n[thud]\nMeathead Pony: It's been stackin' up for years!

There's not a single bookshelf in sight!\nSand Trap: [snoring]\nTwilight Sparkle: Poor Dusty... [to receptionist] Excuse me!\n\"Teddie Safari\": Yes, how may I help you?\nTwilight Sparkle: Do you have a resident named Dusty Pages?\n\"Teddie Safari\": Oh, yes. Her apartment is in the next complex, ground floor.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I can't believe that my carelessness sent her here, when she could be happily surrounded by millions of wonderful-smelling books!\nSpike: You realize that might just be a you thing, right?\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] There she is! Here we go. [exhales]\n[knocking]\n[long pause]\n[watch ticking]\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\nSpike: She's bound to be back soon. Maybe we should just wait here.\nTwilight Sparkle: No. We are fixing this now. This place isn't that big. We can find her.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry to interrupt your plein air painting, but we're looking for Dusty Pages. Have you seen her?\nApple Rose: Sure have!\n[beat]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] And...?\nApple Rose: She had to leave early to get to her fengbi de ti session.\nOld Stallion: Which is right before she leads the woodworking class with me. Then she's on to windsurfing.\nApple Rose: Ooh, and don't forget theatre rehearsal! Dusty's playing the lead role. Again.\nOld Stallion: Then there's her band practice later.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you!\nSpike: Wow. Dusty sounds like one busy pony.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, she's just filling her days with distractions to cover the pain of losing the best job ever! But not for long!\n\n[montage music]\n[gate swinging]\n\n[teleportation zap]\n[hammer tapping]\n[door shuts and opens]\n\n[splash]\n[more splashes]\n\n[door opens]\n\n[door opens]\n[band playing music]\nTwilight Sparkle: Dusty Pages, finally! Come on, Spike!\nSpike: Wait. She looks pretty happy up there.\nTwilight Sparkle: Trust me, it's all an act. She'll be a lot happier when I deliver the news that she can go back to working at the library!\n[music abruptly stops]\nTwilight Sparkle: Care to take five, everypony?\nDusty Pages: Ah! Twilight Sparkle?! My stars! It's so wonderful to see you! What are you doing here?\nTwilight Sparkle: I've been looking all over Equestria for you!\n[thud]\nTwilight Sparkle: I need to tell you something.\nDusty Pages: Well, you brought my mail! Oh, thank you! [chuckles]\nTwilight Sparkle: No. I mean, yes, we did, but that's not why we're here. I let you down, and I can't forgive myself until I set things right.\nDusty Pages: I don't remember you doing anything wrong.\nTwilight Sparkle: You told me to take care of a special book I checked out from the Canterlot Library, and I never brought it back!\nDusty Pages: [gasps] It was you that had that book out? The one that broke my perfect record?\nTwilight Sparkle: But now you can bring it to Canterlot Library and get your job back!\nDusty Pages: No, thank you! I don't ever need to see that library again! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have somewhere to be.\n\n[band playing music]\nSpike: [snapping fingers]\nTwilight Sparkle: Do you mind?\n[music pauses, continues softly]\nSpike: [slurping]\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't understand. If Dusty Pages won't go back to Canterlot Library and explain everything, then she won't be able to get her job back. Even worse, her record will remain imperfect!\nSpike: And yours will, too?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, yeah! But that doesn't matter any more!\nSpike: [dryly] Really?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, maybe a little bit. Oh, no, bits! The late fines! How much do I owe now?!\n[abacus clicking]\nSpike: Uhhh... you don't wanna know.\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans] It would've been worth all the bits in Equestria if I had made things right with Dusty! I wish I knew why she won't go back!\nSpike: Why don't you ask her?\nTwilight Sparkle: She didn't seem to want to talk.\nSpike: You surprised her, and she probably had something else on her schedule. That thing is packed! Come on. What have you got to lose?\nTwilight Sparkle: Now that I've messed up this much? Nothing. You're right, Spike. It's worth a try. Where do you think she went? Crochet? Bingo?\n\n[splat]\nTwilight Sparkle: A squishy fruit food-fight tournament?!\n[splats]\nSpike: Hey, everypony! We come in\u2014\n[splat]\nSpike: Eh, pieces.\n[splats]\n[teleportation zap]\n[splats]\nTwilight Sparkle: Stop! We just want to talk to Dusty Pages for a moment! Please?\nDusty Pages: Time out! [to Twilight] Next time, you should rent gear.\nSpike: We're not actually here for the game.\nTwilight Sparkle: I was hoping you'd give me another chance to talk to you about the library book.\nDusty Pages: [sighs] This really means a lot to you, doesn't it?\nTwilight Sparkle: Mm-hmm. I know I ruined your life by not returning my book on time, and I will do anything I can to make it up to you. Even promise to never take a book out of a library again, if that's what it takes.\n[ponies gasp]\nDusty Pages: [laughs]\nSpike: That is not the reaction we expected.\nDusty Pages: Twilight, dear, you've got it all backwards! I'm not upset with you!\nTwilight Sparkle: You're not?\nDusty Pages: No! If I'm mad at anypony, it's me.\n[tapping]\nDusty Pages: All those years I spent hiding away in that library, trying to be perfect. When your book never came in, I felt something exhilarating!\nTwilight Sparkle: What was it?\nDusty Pages: Freedom.\nSpike: From books?\nDusty Pages: From perfection! I was too stubborn to know when to call it quits! It took your mistake to make me realize that I wasn't living the life I wanted!\nTwilight Sparkle: You mean you weren't fired? You left the library because you wanted to?\nDusty Pages: Twilight, your late book was the best thing that ever happened to me. Now I'm not afraid to try things I might fail at. In fact, sometimes messing up teaches me more than getting it right!\nTwilight Sparkle: You're sure you don't want to return it and get that perfect record back?\n[splat]\nTwilight Sparkle: [strangled scream]\nDusty Pages: Ah, good. It was a yellow one. You can still see the words.\nTwilight Sparkle: But it'll have a stain!\nDusty Pages: That doesn't change the truth inside it. Wait. Did you even read that thing?\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, uh, no, I guess I didn't.\n[splat]\nTwilight Sparkle: [reading] \"Perfection\".\nDusty Pages: And the next part?\nTwilight Sparkle: [reading] \"The Impossible Pursuit\".\nSpike and Dusty Pages: [laughing]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh. That might've been useful to look at earlier.\n\nFirst Folio: Uh-huh... Your total late fees come to...\nTwilight Sparkle: However much it is, I'll cover it. Uh, do you have a monthly payment plan?\nFirst Folio: Twenty-eight bits.\nTwilight Sparkle and Spike: [gasps]\nSpike: That's it?!\nFirst Folio: Yah-huh. Most ponies don't know that it caps at a month. Probably 'cause we don't tell them. [snorts]\n[bits clinking]\nFirst Folio: Thank you. Your account is back to normal. Although we will be taking down your Best Book Borrower picture.\nTwilight Sparkle: Um, is that really necessary? Heh. It just seems so permanent. Heh. I mean, I did return the book, after all.\nSpike: [clears throat]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay. Letting the perfection go. [sighs] You want me to reshelve this for you?\nFirst Folio: No, it's an old edition. We've already replaced it with a new copy.\nSpike: In that case, can we keep it? It might be a good reminder to have around.\nFirst Folio: You sure? It's got a stain.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's what makes it perfect.\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nAnnouncer: Highlights in the world of sports! Buckball fever has swept Equestria! What started as a backyard hobby for fruit farmers and the like has blossomed into a literal phenomenon, with something for everypony. Unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth ponies alike can't get enough of this breakthrough sport.\n[fans cheering]\nAnnouncer: And with its popularity still on the rise, buckball fans want\u2014nay, demand\u2014an institution catering to their new obsession. And the ponies of Appleloosa answered the call, delivering a state-of-the-art locale where fans Equestria over can celebrate their passion: the Buckball Hall of Fame. Though given the game's recent nature, the only inductees so far will be the members of the current championship team from Ponyville.\nPinkie Pie: [whispering loudly] Do you think they know we're here?\nRainbow Dash: I think they have a pretty good idea.\nSnails: A pretty good idea about what? [chomps]\n\n[theme song]\n\nFluttershy: I can't believe the ponies of Appleloosa built this place.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah, especially after their team lost to us. They must really love buckball.\nFan: [chuckles] Oh, my gosh! It's you! I can't believe you're you! I mean, here! I mean, Team Ponyville! Yeah!\nSnails: Yep, it's us.\nFan: How much for an autograph?\nSnips: Bits for autographs, eh?\n[cha-ching!]\nSnips: [whispering] Snails, you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?\nSnails: What is the sound of one hoof clapping?\nSnips: Yeah! I mean, uh, no! How many of you would pay for an autograph from my best friend Snails?\n[ponies clamoring]\nMale Pony: I can't believe I'm about to get his autograph.\nSnails: Wow! That's a lot of writing.\nFluttershy: I'm so proud they decided to honor us. I never thought I'd get to be in anything like a Hall of Fame.\nPinkie Pie: Me, neither! Unless you count a Royal Order of Party Planners Memorial Library, which I don't, because every party planner gets one of those eventually.\n[hooves clack]\n[clamoring continues]\n[bits jingling]\nFluttershy: I hope Snails finishes signing autographs soon. We can't play without him. And if we lose or forfeit one game, we'll be out of the tournament.\nRainbow Dash: Well, he better get his flank over here then! You have to win the first few games without me cheering you on.\nFluttershy: Oh, why?\nRainbow Dash: [sighs] Applejack was too busy to come, so she made me promise to go to all the museum exhibits and tell her about them. I'm gonna try to get in first and beat the crowd so I can get back to the tournament faster.\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! Then you'd better hurry. Looks like there's already a line.\nRainbow Dash: What?! [grunts] The doors aren't even open yet! What kind of sports fan camps out for a museum?\nQuibble Pants: The real question is what kind of sports fan doesn't?\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] Quibble Pants?\nQuibble Pants: Rainbow Dash, fancy meeting you here.\nRainbow Dash: Fancy meeting me? I'm a sportspony. Of course I'd be here. What's fancy is you being here. If \"fancy\" meant confusing.\nQuibble Pants: There's nothing fancy or confusing about it. Y-You can't keep me away from that... that buckball rink. I'm... I'm the biggest fan there is.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, it's a buckball field. And you are?\nQuibble Pants: Oh... sure. What w-with all th-the bucking and the balling, uh, uh, on the buckball field, w-which is where they play buckball. I-I-I wanted to be first inside to experience the grand history of the sport. I-I mean, I guess only a real fan would understand that.\nRainbow Dash: Whaaaa...?\nQuibble Pants: Oh, perfect timing. Rainbow Dash, I'd like you to meet Clear Sky, the most amazing pony I've ever met.\nRainbow Dash: Um, you've met Daring Do, so that's probably an exaggeration. [to Clear Sky] No offense.\nClear Sky: None taken. When it comes to describing your special somepony, a little exaggeration's normal. [to Quibble] And I feel the same way about you.\nRainbow Dash: And who is this?\nClear Sky: This is my daughter Wind Sprint.\nQuibble Pants: And she is pretty amazing, too!\nClear Sky: Wind, did you thank Quibble for camping out so we'd be first in line?\nWind Sprint: [unenthusiastic] Thanks.\nQuibble Pants: No problem. I-I-I probably would have done it anyway. I mean, I... I can't wait to see the... [reading from a brochure] \"evolution of the buck basket from farm to field\"! That... That sounds just, I mean, oh, wow! There... There is a lot to see!\n[crowd cheering]\nWind Sprint: I'd rather see the game.\nQuibble Pants: Oh. Well, I... I mean, sure. T-T-That makes sense. We could just go to the tournament instead.\nClear Sky: No! Quibble planned this whole thing for us, and you could be a little more appreciative!\n[door opens]\n\nRainbow Dash: [chuckles] I kind of wanted to skip the museum, too. But I promised a friend that I'd check out all the exhibits.\nWind Sprint: Ugh! All of them?\nQuibble Pants: You, know, I-I'd like a chance to catch up with Rainbow Dash. Why don't we split up? We'll... We'll cover more ground that way, and...\nRainbow Dash: So... you and Clear Sky, huh?\nQuibble Pants: Oh, yeah, she's great. Honestly, I've never been happier... [panicked] Which is why I need your help! I don't know what any of this stuff is!\nRainbow Dash: What do you mean?\nQuibble Pants: See this? I-I don't know what it is.\nRainbow Dash: A ball?\nQuibble Pants: W\u2014 And this? I-I\u2014 No idea!\nRainbow Dash: It's a basket. How do you not know what these are?\nQuibble Pants: I'm not even a hundred percent sure what bucking is. I literally know nothing about buckball or any other sport!\nRainbow Dash: Well, I figured you weren't the sportiest pony in Equestria.\nQuibble Pants: But Wind Sprint is, and her dad was some big athlete, too. I-I can't compete with that. I really want things with Clear Sky to work out, but if Wind doesn't like me, I-I might as well give up.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, why?\nQuibble Pants: They're a family. Even if it's okay with Clear Sky, I wouldn't ask them to make me a part of it if Wind Sprint isn't on board. I thought if I could convince Wind I was a big buckball fan, we'd have something to bond over, but I'm... I'm pretty sure she's on to me.\nRainbow Dash: Here.\nQuibble Pants: [grunting]\nRainbow Dash: Give it a shot. It's easy.\nQuibble Pants: Aah! Aah! Oof!\n[thud]\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, I don't think she's fooled.\nQuibble Pants: Could... Could you talk to her? I-I mean, you're a famous sportspony. Y-You'd know what to say. Maybe you could talk me up a little.\nRainbow Dash: Ha! No problem. I've totally got your flank.\nQuibble Pants: [grunts]\nRainbow Dash: [to Wind Sprint] Trust me, the game's a lot harder to play with apples.\nWind Sprint: You play?\nRainbow Dash: Who do you think taught them? Of course, being a Wonderbolt takes up most of my time, so I don't get to practice as much as I'd like.\nWind Sprint: Wait. You're Rainbow Dash? The Wonderbolt? Whoa, my dad was a great flyer, too.\nRainbow Dash: Hmm, you don't say. You know, Quibble's pretty sporty, too.\nClear Sky: [groans]\nQuibble Pants: [grunts]\n[thud]\nWind Sprint: [unconvinced] If you say so.\n\nRainbow Dash: I think I've seen enough of this museum for three Applejacks. Let's go watch some buckball!\nQuibble Pants: That sounds awesome! Oh, but first, I got you [singsongy] a little surprise.\nWind Sprint: [unimpressed] Oh. A book.\n[thud]\nQuibble Pants: Oh, not just a book. It's a buckball almanac. This thing has every buckball fact and statistic ever recorded!\nWind Sprint: [sarcastic] Wow.\nQuibble Pants: I know! I never realized there was so much math in buckball. I-I mean, this game's got more numbers than Ogres & Oubliettes. [laughs, snorts]\nWind Sprint: Thanks?\nQuibble Pants: I-I-I guess I could hold it for you. You know, so you don't have to carry it.\nWind Sprint: Can we go to the game now?\nClear Sky: Sure, honey. Listen, Q, this trip was a lovely idea, and the book was sweet, but you don't have to try so hard. Everything's gonna be fine. [kisses]\nQuibble Pants: Not even my presents are in the ball court.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, do you mean \"ball park\"?\nQuibble Pants: Do I?! I don't know! One thing's for sure: Wind is never gonna like a pony like me.\nRainbow Dash: Of course she will. She just needs to see your sporty side.\nQuibble Pants: I don't have a sporty side.\nRainbow Dash: Everypony has a sporty side, and we're gonna find yours. By the end of the day, I am gonna turn you into the sportiest pony in Equestria!\n\nQuibble Pants: Look, I'm not saying it's a terrible idea, but it's a terrible idea! You can't turn me into an athlete! It's impossible!\nRainbow Dash: It's either that or be yourself and bond with Wind over comic books and role-playing games.\nWind Sprint: Ooh! Ah! [laughs]\nQuibble Pants: Uh, I have a 17 charisma, all right? Don't you think I tried? She doesn't even like Daring Do. She thinks she's not athletic enough.\nRainbow Dash: What?! Wow. We need to get started on \"Operation: Sportify\" ASAP.\n\nRainbow Dash: To figure out what your sporty side is, we just need to see what your skills are. Everypony's got something. Speed!\n[zooming]\nRainbow Dash: Strength!\nQuibble Pants: Whoa!\nRainbow Dash: Agility! Heh. Of course, some ponies can do it all.\nQuibble Pants: You're amazing, but what about me?\nRainbow Dash: Right. We should probably start small. I'll pass the ball to you, and you just pass it back to me, okay?\nQuibble Pants: Okay. Uh-huh.\n[music builds up]\nQuibble Pants: And... buckball!\n[thud]\nQuibble Pants: Ow.\nRainbow Dash: Okay. Maybe agility's not your thing.\n\nRainbow Dash: Ready?\nQuibble Pants: If I say no, do I still have to run?\nRainbow Dash: Yep.\nSnips: Can we get on with this? Snails and I did so well with the autographs, we decided to expand. And these souvenirs are not going to sell themselves!\nRainbow Dash: Remember, think speed.\nQuibble Pants: Got it.\nRainbow Dash: On your marks, get set...\nQuibble Pants: Speed. Speed.\nRainbow Dash: Go! [blows whistle]\nQuibble Pants: Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Whew! [laughs] Okay! What a race, right? Oh. So much for speed.\nSnips: Eh, this was fun, but I've gotta get back to work.\n\nRainbow Dash: Come on, Quibble. You got this!\nQuibble Pants: [strained voice] I... got... this! I... Ugh! This is hopeless. I... I don't have any skills. Not agility, not speed. I-I can't even lift more than one book, and I love books!\nRainbow Dash: If we had time to train, I know I could mold you into the perfect sportspony. [groans] Or at least a sportier pony.\nQuibble Pants: Who knows how long that would take? I-I need to get Wind to like me now.\n[crowd cheering]\nRainbow Dash: Maybe you're not the best athlete in Equestria, or the most coordinated, or the fastest, or... even a little bit strong.\nQuibble Pants: I-I'm sorry, wait. Is this supposed to be making me feel better? Because it's not.\nRainbow Dash: But none of that matters because I just figured out how to sportify you!\n\n[action theme]\n[whistle blows]\n[crowd cheering]\nGame Announcer: And with that score, the stars of Team Ponyville advance to the next round. If they keep winning like this, they'll never get off the field.\nWind Sprint: Wow! The players from Ponyville are so good!\nQuibble Pants: They sure are.\nClear Sky: Quibble, where have you been? I was hoping we'd all watch the tournament together.\nQuibble Pants: Oh, I've just been arranging for us to hang out with a few of my close friends. From Team Ponyville. That is, if Wind's up for it.\n\nClear Sky: This is wonderful, Q, but I still feel like you're trying too hard to get Wind's approval.\nWind Sprint: This is so great! Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy are the best players out there!\nRainbow Dash: Well, you can thank Quibble. Wonderbolts, buckball stars... He's friends with the sportiest ponies around, so he must be pretty sporty, too, right?\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, so this is Quibble Pants. Rainbow Dash told us all about how you two spent a whole Daring Do convention geeking out together about books!\nFluttershy: And even though at first she thought you were the most annoying fanpony she ever met, you two eventually became friends.\nQuibble Pants: Uh...\nClear Sky: I guess even sportsponies agree. Quibble's a pony you like more and more over time.\nWind Sprint: Ugh. Knowing sportsponies isn't the same as being one. [to Fluttershy and Pinkie] What's it like playing in front of all those fans?\nFluttershy: Um...\nRainbow Dash: I guess you'll find out.\nWind Sprint: What do you mean?\nQuibble Pants: Yes, what do you mean?\nRainbow Dash: I think it's time we told Wind about your next surprise.\nClear Sky: Q, Wind really doesn't need any more surprises.\nWind Sprint: Is it another book?\nRainbow Dash: A \u2013 books are awesome. And B \u2013 this is way more awesomer than that! For the tournament halftime show, you and Quibble are gonna play a game of buckball against Team Ponyville!\nQuibble Pants: We're what?!\n\n[distant crowd cheering]\n[whoosh, thud]\n[whirring, thuds]\nRainbow Dash: Uh, you should probably stretch.\nQuibble Pants: No amount of stretching is gonna make this okay! What were you thinking?!\nRainbow Dash: Look, you wanted to impress Wind Sprint, and this just made sense.\nQuibble Pants: Really? How does me making a fool of myself in front of her, Sky, and a billion buckball fans make sense?\nRainbow Dash: Don't worry, I've got your flank. I already talked to Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy. They're totally gonna make you look good.\nQuibble Pants: Oh. Okay, well, maybe this isn't the absolute worst idea ever.\nGame Announcer: Mares and stallions, foals and colts! Put your hooves together for today's halftime presentation, as buckball's biggest stars take on a team of fans just like you!\n[crowd cheering]\n\nReferee: [blows whistle]\n[whoosh]\n[thud]\n[crowd cheers]\nGame Announcer: And that's one for the Ponyville champs! Looks like these fans don't know what they signed up for!\n\nReferee: [blows whistle]\n[whooshing]\nFluttershy: [flatly] Oh, no. Quibble's wide open, and I'll never get there in time to block.\n[whoosh]\n[slow motion noise]\n[crowd awwws]\nGame Announcer: Ooh! Looks like our fan team needs to work on their passing!\n\nReferee: [blows whistle]\n[whooshing]\nFluttershy: [gasps]\nPinkie Pie: Hee-hee!\n[crack]\n[smack]\n[thud]\nFluttershy: [gasps]\nPinkie Pie: [gasps]\nGame Announcer: And the fan team finally scores! ...For the other side. That makes three! Team Ponyville wins!\n[smack]\n\n[thud]\nQuibble Pants: It says very clearly on page six-forty-seven of the expanded buckball tournament rules that \"a goal is scored when an Earth pony sends the ball into a basket\". But it doesn't say which basket!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, I'm pretty sure everypony knows you're not supposed to score in the other team's goal.\nQuibble Pants: But the rules don't say that! If that goal is ours, it's only two-to-one, and we can keep playing.\nWind Sprint: I don't want to! You're not a sportspony! It's not fun playing this game with you!\nQuibble Pants: I was just... trying to get her to like me.\nClear Sky: I know! But I told you you didn't need to. You and I have to rethink all of this.\nQuibble Pants: [whimpers, sighs]\n\nRainbow Dash: What are you doing out here?\nQuibble Pants: Apparently this book is as close to sports as I'll ever get.\nRainbow Dash: Come on. That goal you scored for the other team was amazing.\nQuibble Pants: [sighs] Thanks for trying, Rainbow Dash, but I think we can both agree the whole sportify idea was a big flop.\n[thump]\nRainbow Dash: What?! We haven't even gotten started! I've got, like, seven more top-notch ideas to turn you into a super-sporty pony!\nQuibble Pants: [sighs] Wind's already made up her mind, and so have I. Time to throw up the towel.\nRainbow Dash: It's \"throw in the towel\". And that's ridiculous! You can't just give up!\nQuibble Pants: Wind and Sky deserve a pony they both like in their lives. Besides, Sky wants to \"rethink things\", so I'm just beating her to the lunch.\nRainbow Dash: It's \"beating her to the punch\", and it's barely a sports reference. How do you not know that?\nQuibble Pants: Because... I! Don't! Know! Anything! About! Sports! And pretending I did just made things worse.\nRainbow Dash: So you should stop pretending! Look, you are terrible at sports. You're uncoordinated, slow, weak\u2014\nQuibble Pants: Okay, again, not really making me feel better.\nRainbow Dash: And you're completely clueless about anything having to do with athletics. But maybe I'm not the pony you should've come to for help.\nQuibble Pants: Oh.\n\nWind Sprint: I wish we didn't even come here.\nClear Sky: Quibble thought you'd like it.\nWind Sprint: Well, I don't, and I don't like him. Why do you like him?\nClear Sky: Because he's kind, and smart, and his friends certainly seem to care about him, which is always a good sign.\nWind Sprint: I don't care how many ponies care about him. They're not gonna make me forget about Dad.\nClear Sky: Oh, sweetheart. I know Quibble's trying too hard, but he doesn't want you to stop loving your dad. He just wants you to like him. And I think maybe there's enough room in your heart to do both.\nQuibble Pants: Hey, there. Glad I found you, because I have a confession to make. I know it's hard to imagine, but I'm... really not all that sporty.\nClear Sky: [mock horror] [gasps] No!\nQuibble Pants: I'm sorry I was trying so hard to convince you otherwise. I just really wanted us to get along, but I guess it backfired. Do you think we could start over? Maybe we could watch some of the tournament together, and you could teach me some sports stuff?\n\n[whoosh, thud]\n[crowd cheering]\nWind Sprint: Okay. That's their ball.\nQuibble Pants: I'll try to remember that if I ever decide to play buckball again. But I probably won't. Oh, look. Pinkie Pie's gonna flip and triple bounce the ball into the goal.\n[springing]\n[thud]\n[crowd cheers]\nWind Sprint: How did you know that?\nQuibble Pants: It's right here. Pinkie flips and triple-bounce bucks over eighty percent of her shots from the northwest section of the field when the wind is blowing from the east.\nWind Sprint: Huh. I guess this book's kind of cool after all.\nClear Sky: [slurping]\nQuibble Pants: Look, Sky, I know you're thinking of calling it quits between us, and after today, I don't blame you. But Wind and I just made a connection!\nClear Sky: Calling it quits? What are you talking about?\nQuibble Pants: You said you wanted to rethink things.\nClear Sky: Yeah! Things like having your friend help you pretend to be a sportspony so Wind would like you.\nQuibble Pants: Wha\u2014 I-I don't\u2014 I\u2014 Oh! I-I didn't... What?!\nRainbow Dash: Say wha\u2014? [nervous laugh] Wha...?! Hah! Nah!\nWind Sprint: Mom, look what Quibble showed me! [reading] \"When Fluttershy flies higher than the other Pegasus, Pinkie scores ninety-two percent of the time,\" and it just happened!\nClear Sky: Wow! You better watch out, or you're gonna start to like books.\nWind Sprint: I guess that wouldn't be so bad.\nClear Sky: Huh. Looks like you didn't need sportiness, famous ponies, or lavish gifts to bond with Wind after all.\nRainbow Dash: Technically, he still needed to buy her the book, but that's it.\nQuibble Pants, Clear Sky, and Wind Sprint: [laughing]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nSilverstream: [gasps] See?!

[nervous laugh] Now, what can I do for you, Yona?\nYona: Yona not know yak need special pony dress for dance. Yona no can wear what Yona always wear?\nRarity: Yona could\u2014 I mean, you could. But the Fetlock Fete or whatever Twilight is calling it \u2013 it's all about a tradition. There's a certain way to do everything at the dance.\nYona: Yes! That what Yona want to learn! How to do all the pony things, even if Yona has to wear dress.\nRarity: Well, uh, y-y-yes, if that's what you really want.\nYona: Mm-hmm! Yona be best pony pal for Sandbar!\nRarity: In that case, at an elegant affair like a pony dance, one must converse in a sophisticated fashion.

Except for baking.\nFluttershy: There are two traditional dances that everypony does at the Fete. After a few days of practicing with us, you'll know them both.\nYona: And fit right in!\nRarity: Absolutely. We'll start with the slow dance, the Pony Cotillion. That's Fluttershy's specialty.\nFluttershy: Oh, [nervous laugh], I wouldn't say specialty. It's just fun. Here, Yona. I made you a chart.\n[paper unfurling]\nFluttershy: All you have to do is follow these dance steps. You'll learn them in no time.\n[thump]\n[record needle scratches]\n[classical music plays]\nFluttershy: Now, just start walking. Step on whatever color I name. Let's begin. Blue, red, step ahead.

Rarity tells us you need some help gettin' ready for the big dance.\nRarity: \"Some\". Ha! Indeed. And we only have a few more days.\nPinkie Pie: Well, you've come to the right place. Because if you asked me what my favorite part of the dance is, I'd say everything about the dance! But especially... this! The Fetlock lucky pot dinner!\nApplejack: It's part of the Ponyville dance tradition. Everypony brings a dish to share, and we swap 'em without knowin' whose is whose. Although my lucky pot probably gives me away. [laughs]\nPinkie Pie: You can cook anything you want! Like, can I suggest, oh, I don't know, maybe... cupcakes?!\nRarity: Uh, I already told Yona a little bit about that tradition. She's even brought her own lucky... bucket.\nYona: Yak buckets are best buckets. Yona think make traditional yak dish \u2013 tree-root stew!\n[flies buzzing]\nYona: Extra fiber. Mmmm. Ponies like?\nPinkie Pie: Hmm, I'm not sure. So, just in case, let's get baking!\n\nPinkie Pie: [quickly] Flour, milk, sugar, butter, icing. Then we mix, and we beat, and we pour into pans. We bake...\n[ding!]\nPinkie Pie: And now you try it!\n[ripping]\nYona: [sneezes]\nPinkie Pie: Well, that's one way to mix it.\nApplejack: Let's try somethin' a little simpler.

There's no pony pressure.\nGallus, Ocellus, and Smolder: [giggling]\nOcellus: You should've told Yona that.\nSandbar: Uh, what do you mean?\nSilverstream: Didn't you hear? Our teachers have been helping her get ready for the dance! She's been taking lessons. [crunching]\nSmolder: She's gone full pony for the dance.\nGallus: All for you.\n[snap!]\nSandbar: For me? Why?\nYona: [elocuting] How kind of you to ask me to this soiree, Sandbar.\nGallus, Ocellus, Silverstream, and Smolder: Uhh...\nSmolder: What?\nSilverstream: You look so weird!\nSandbar: Yona?!\nYona: [elocuting] Quite. Oh, I do hope I make a good pony pal for you.\nSandbar: Uh, of course you do. But, Yona, you didn't need to do any of... this.\nSmolder: And why are you talking so funny?\nYona: [elocuting] I am not \"talking funny\". I'm fitting in.\nGallus: Could've fooled me.\nRarity: Yona! You look absolutely scrumptious, darling.

That's right, everycreature! It's the Pony Prance!\n[slider clicking]\n[uptempo pop music plays]\nSandbar: Uh, maybe we should sit this one out.\nYona: [elocuting] No!

I figured you'd come here. Besides, it's where I'd go if something like that happened to me.\nYona: Sandbar mean something awful and embarrassing. So awful, Yona cannot come down from treehouse ever!\n[whirring]\nYona: Will Sandbar bring Yona food and water?\nSandbar: You know, it really wasn't that bad. I don't think anycreature hardly even noticed.\n[beat]\nSandbar: Well, maybe one or two didn't. If they happened to be in Canterlot for the day. But anyway, it's all over now, so... will you come back to the dance with me?\n[thump]\nYona: Yona disappoint Sandbar. Yona not make very good pony.\nSandbar: Why would you think you disappointed me? And who said anything about having to be a good pony?\nYona: Yona just want to do all the right pony things and fit in at dance! Then maybe Sandbar and Yona win best pony pals contest. Instead, Yona win worst pony ever.\n[crunch]\nSandbar: That's not true.\nYona: Really? Sandbar, name two ponies worse than Yona.\nSandbar: Cozy Glow and Sombra.\nYona: [chuckles] Okay, Sandbar right. They worse.\nSandbar: Yona, it doesn't really matter if you're a great pony or a horrible pony. You're the best Yona I know. That's why I asked you to the dance.\nYona: Really?\nSandbar: I never wanted you to be anything other than what you are. My friend, Yona, the yak. [grunts] So, what do you say? Let's go back to the dance?\n\nYona sad...\nYona sing sad song...\nSad Yona...\n\nYona sad...\nYona sing sad song...\n\n[sweeping]\nRarity: [sighs]\n[door opens]\nRarity: [gasps]\nFluttershy: [gasps]\nSandbar: [hushed] Don't worry.

Not mean to make such a mess and ruin the pony dance.\nApplejack: It's not your fault, sugarcube.\nRainbow Dash: It's the opposite. If anything, we should be apologizing.\nPinkie Pie: I thought we were just teaching you how to have fun at the dance.\nRarity: We never meant to try to turn you into something you're not.\nYona: Is okay. Friend help Yona feel better.\nTwilight Sparkle: And that's why we're giving you this.\nSandbar and Yona: Huh?\nSandbar: No way! The Pony Pal prize!\nTwilight Sparkle: From now on, it's the annual Amity Ball Award for Friendship!\nApplejack: No pony-ness required.\nRainbow Dash: We all decided you and Yona totally earned this.\nRarity: Your actions tonight exemplify the true meaning of friendship.\nTwilight Sparkle: Congratulations, you two!\nYoung Six: [cheering]\n[students cheering]\nSpike: Yona! I'm glad you're back! Everypony wants to learn that crazy dance you did!\nYona: Yak dance? Is easy!

If not, I don't know why I'm wasting my time here. I am a queen, you know?\nGrogar: [snorts] I'm leaving, since it's impossible to accomplish the work I need to do here.

When Grogar sees this, he'll realize there's no way he could survive without me!\nLord Tirek: [grunting]\nCozy Glow: You're gonna have to exercise a lot to get as big as you were when you absorbed the life force of all those ponies. Anywho, Grogar wants us all to work together, so I've scheduled a team meeting. Doesn't that sound fun? And since Grogar left me in charge...\nLord Tirek: No, he didn't.\nCozy Glow: [giggles] Someone's a real grumpy-taur today. If we aren't meeting, I guess I could just stay and offer positive and inspiring\u2014\nLord Tirek: Fine! I'll join your meeting. Just leave!\nCozy Glow: See you soon!\n\nQueen Chrysalis: It's been weeks, and Grogar's done nothing! It's not healthy to hold on to all of this rage! I could lash out at any moment.\nCozy Glow: And how are you doing this fine\u2014?\nQueen Chrysalis: How do you think I'm doing?! I'm ready to exact my revenge!

And even if he did, Chrysalis obeys no one.\nCozy Glow: [singsongy] There'll be cupcakes.\n\nCozy Glow: Grogar wants us to work together to defeat our enemies.

I had hoped by now you would've resolved your differences, but apparently not.\nQueen Chrysalis: Perhaps if we knew what the plan was, we would be better able to prepare!\nLord Tirek: Assuming you even have a plan.\nGrogar: Of course I have a plan! I have located an object of power, and it occurs to me this is the perfect test. The three of you will work together to retrieve it. Against this item, those ponies won't stand a chance.\nQueen Chrysalis: I have come close to ruling Equestria several times. Perhaps I should be the one to lead us.\nCozy Glow: I nearly drained all the magic from Equestria! That was good!\nLord Tirek: I absorbed all the magic of Equestria!

A talisman containing much of my own magic. The Bell cannot be destroyed, so Gusty hid it in a place it has taken me millennia to discover \u2013 an enchanted cave high atop Mt. Everhoof, protected by magical winds that prevent anypony from reaching its peak. There, the Bell has remained until now.\n\nGrogar: Scale Mt. Everhoof. Bring me back my Bell.\nQueen Chrysalis: [laughs] The ease of this task is laughable.\n\n[bird screeches]\nQueen Chrysalis: Well, it sounded easy.\n\n[bird screeches]\nLord Tirek: Scale the mountain...\nQueen Chrysalis: ...retrieve Grogar's Bell...\nCozy Glow: ...together! I drew up a detailed plan with several visual aids to show how we can... ditch each other and do it alone. Maybe when I'm waiting for them at the top, then they'll appreciate me.\n\n[wind whistling]\n[growling]\nQueen Chrysalis: [hisses]\n[whimpering]\nQueen Chrysalis: As if anything on this mountain is scarier than I.

There ain't been ponies around here in I-don't-know-how-many moons!\nCozy Glow: [whimpering] Oh, golly, good sir. I'm just a poor lost pony looking for help.\nRusty Bucket: Aw, don't fret, little filly. Ol' Rusty Bucket here, at your service.\nCozy Glow: I'm so glad I found you. I need help getting to the top of the mountain.\nRusty Bucket: Uh, no can do, ma'am.\nCozy Glow: Why not?!\n[rumbling]\nRusty Bucket: [lowered] Shhh! Not so loud! This here's avalanche territory. I'm the guardian of this here mountain. It's my job to keep ponies from heading up. Nothing at the top but dangerous snow, dangerous ice, and dangerous wind. Basically, it's dangerous.\nCozy Glow: It must get lonely all by yourself. Maybe I could be your friend?\nRusty Bucket: Aw. I'd love a friend.\nCozy Glow: So, now that we are friends, you could help me up the mountain.\nRusty Bucket: Hmm, uh... a real friend wouldn't ask me to do something I'm not supposed to do. Says so right here in the Journal of Friendship, written by Twilight Sparkle and her friends.\nCozy Glow: are. you. kidding me?! [echoing]\n[birds chirping]\nRusty Bucket: Shhhh!\nCozy Glow: I didn't want to be friends anyway.\nRusty Bucket: Awww...\n\n[slipping sounds]\n[transformation noise]\n[crunch!]\n[crunch!]\n[transformation noise]\n[transformation noise]\nQueen Chrysalis: Almost there.\n\n[crunching]\n[leaves rustling]\n\n[wind whistling]\n[thud]\n\n[snow crunching]\nRusty Bucket: Nope.

Now, just calm down there, filly.\nCozy Glow: You calm down! Ponies are supposed to do [echoing] what I ask them to do! It's, like, my thing!

Surprise, surprise.\nCozy Glow: You didn't make it to the top either.\nLord Tirek: I didn't try to.\nCozy Glow: What?!\nLord Tirek: It took about five minutes to deduce that Grogar was right. None of us could make it up alone. So, rather than subject myself to the elements, I decided to let you two face the danger, take what you learned, and use it to my advantage. [laughs]\nCozy Glow: I put up with your \"I'm smarter than you\" attitude in Tartarus! But I'm over it!\nLord Tirek: I'd had enough of you trying to manipulate me with that insincere, syrupy sweetness. At least now we can see the real you.\nCozy Glow: This is not the real me! I'm cute and lovable!\nLord Tirek: [scoffs] No, you're not. You're annoying, and you snore.\nCozy Glow: I do not snore!\nLord Tirek: [mock-snoring]\nCozy Glow: At least I don't talk to my Gram-Gram in my sleep.\nLord Tirek: Don't you dare bring Gram-Gram into this!\n[Ophiotaurus roars]\nCozy Glow and Lord Tirek: This is your fault!\n\n[Ophiotaurus roars]\nQueen Chrysalis: [roars]\n[Ophiotaurus grunts softly]\nCozy Glow: Quick! It's distracted! Let's go!\nLord Tirek: Wait.\nQueen Chrysalis: [roars]\n[transformation noise]\n[magic sounds]\nQueen Chrysalis: [slurps]\n[thud]\nQueen Chrysalis: Mmmm... So much love. I haven't eaten this well in ages.\nCozy Glow: [gags] So gross.\nQueen Chrysalis: Just so we're clear, I didn't save you because I like you. I did it because... because I...\nCozy Glow: Neeeeeeed us?\nQueen Chrysalis: [gritted] Yes.\nLord Tirek: Clearly I was right to wait. Now tell me everything you learned today. Leave nothing out.\n\nCozy Glow: Why are you doing that? Didn't you already drain it of love?\nQueen Chrysalis: I always save a little for the next day.\nCozy Glow: You cocoon all of your... meals?\nQueen Chrysalis: Of course.\nCozy Glow: So when you pony-napped Twilight and the others, you cocooned them.\nQueen Chrysalis: Yes. Until that sow Starlight Glimmer freed them, corrupted my subjects, and stole my hive!\nLord Tirek: Those ponies have weaknesses. I used that turncoat Discord. Tricked him into helping me capture his so-called \"friends\".\nQueen Chrysalis: [sighs] Discord was really something until friendship ruined him.\nLord Tirek: You should've seen Twilight's face when her friends appeared in bubbles around me. She was all... [exaggerated groaning]\nCozy Glow and Queen Chrysalis: [laughing]\nCozy Glow: She's so stressed out all the time.\nQueen Chrysalis: When I posed as her former foal-sitter, I thought she was going to implode!\nCozy Glow, Lord Tirek, and Queen Chrysalis: [laughing]\nCozy Glow: I wish I could've seen her face when I nearly erased all the magic from Equestria.\nLord Tirek: All magic was a little excessive, don't you think?\nCozy Glow: Eh, I think big. Besides, it would've been worth it just to see Twilight and her friends bow down to me!\nLord Tirek: Indeed it would. Who wouldn't love to see those prissy ponies realize they lost everything?\n[transformation noise]\nQueen Chrysalis: I'm a pathetic pony princess! I made a detailed list of all the ways I'm a failure!\nCozy Glow and Lord Tirek: [laughing]\nLord Tirek: You know, working with you two may not be the worst thing.\nQueen Chrysalis: Perhaps... as long as it results in the complete destruction of our enemies.\nCozy Glow: I wouldn't have it any other way. Do the pathetic princess thing again!\n[transformation noise]\nCozy Glow and Lord Tirek: [laughing]\n\n[door opens, closes]\n[transformation noise]\nQueen Chrysalis: [roars]\n[rumbling]\n[flump!]\nCozy Glow, Lord Tirek, and Queen Chrysalis: [laughing]\nRusty Bucket: I'm okay!\n\n[transformation noise]\nQueen Chrysalis: [growls]\n[crash!]\n\n[wind whistling]\n\n[transformation noise]\n[wings flapping]\n[transformation noise]\n[transformation noise]\n\n[zap!]\nQueen Chrysalis: Aah!\n[thud]\n[zap!]\nLord Tirek: [pained groan]\nCozy Glow: Can you absorb it and make it go away?\nLord Tirek: I can only absorb magic from living beings.\nCozy Glow: Like her?\nQueen Chrysalis: Betrayal!\nCozy Glow: Not betrayal. Teamwork. If Tirek absorbs your energy, he might be strong enough to break through.\nQueen Chrysalis: And then?\nCozy Glow: Then... he gives it back.\nLord Tirek: I do?\nCozy Glow: Mm-hmm.\nQueen Chrysalis: How do I know you won't take my magic and leave me?\nCozy Glow: Would we do that to you? Okay, normally, yes, we would.\nLord Tirek: I'll give you your magic back.\nQueen Chrysalis: Do it.\n[magic sounds]\nQueen Chrysalis: [groaning]\nLord Tirek: So... much... power! [kisses] Welcome back, baby!\n[magic sounds]\nLord Tirek: It's not big enough for me!\nCozy Glow: Maybe not you! Keep it open, or I'll be trapped forever!\nQueen Chrysalis: Would that be so terrible?\nLord Tirek: [chuckles, grunts] Can't... hold... much... longer! Hurry!\n[flump!]\nCozy Glow: Ta-da!\nQueen Chrysalis: My magic...\n[magic sounds]\nQueen Chrysalis: I-I wasn't sure you were going to give it back.\nLord Tirek: Neither was I. But working together seemed smarter than to continue fighting.\nCozy Glow: When we helped each other, it felt better somehow.\nQueen Chrysalis: I haven't felt like this since before I lost my hive. Having others who will be there for you is... pleasing.\nLord Tirek: All of these years taking power from ponies...\nCozy Glow: When you use your power to help others...\nQueen Chrysalis: Yes, it feels... nooooooooo!\nCozy Glow and Lord Tirek: Whoa!\nQueen Chrysalis: The Magic of Friendship is like a disease! An infection that spreads to those around you! I watched it infect my hive! I will not let it get me!\nCozy Glow: Same.\nLord Tirek: Obviously.\nCozy Glow: But... Grogar said we have to work together.\nQueen Chrysalis: Grogar is too powerful. Something must be done about that. Let Grogar think we're his loyal servants. In the meantime, we'll hatch our own plan.\nCozy Glow: Ooh... I love a good backstabbing!\nLord Tirek: After that, we can go back to trying to destroy each other!\nCozy Glow: In the meantime, what do we do with this?\n\nGrogar: You failed to retrieve the Bell?!\n[loud thud]\nCozy Glow: W-W-We're sorry, almighty Grogar.\nLord Tirek: We worked together as you asked.\nQueen Chrysalis: We just aren't as powerful as you.\nGrogar: [angry shout]\n[magic zap]\n[boom!]\nGrogar: Obviously! At least you finally did as you were told and worked together.\nCozy Glow: Of course!\nLord Tirek: Whatever you command!\nQueen Chrysalis: Forget about that old bell. You were right.

Sorry to bug you in the Teachers' Lounge. Is it okay if I miss class?\nTwilight Sparkle: Mm-hmm. You can make it up tomorrow.\nSmolder: Actually, I'll be gone for a week.\nTwilight Sparkle: A week?! In the middle of the semester?\nFluttershy: Oh, is everything all right, Smolder?\nSmolder: Not exactly. [sighs] My brother's been having a hard time since I left for school. I want to go home and check on him. He's a really sweet guy, and the other dragons can be kind of rough.\nSpike: Did you say \"sweet guy\" and \"dragon\" in the same sentence?\nSmolder: Yeah. He's sort of like you, Spike.\nSpike: Awww...\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm sorry to hear about your brother, Smolder. But the Dragon Lands are really far for you to go by yourself. And I'm not sure about you missing so much class.\nSpike: Hey! What if she got a school credit for it? Kind of like a... a kindness field trip? I'll go with her.\nSmolder: Thanks! The Dragon Lord is way too busy for personal problems when it's baby dragon hatching season.\nFluttershy: Baby... dragon... hatching season?! [gasps] All those cute little snouts poking out of those adorable little shells?! Teeny, tiny, twitchy tails?! Can I go too?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, you are the perfect pony to lead a kindness field trip.\n[beat]\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs] Fine. But I'm gonna expect a full report when you get back.\nSmolder: How many pages?\nTwilight Sparkle: I was talking to Fluttershy. Hatching season sounds fascinating!\nFluttershy, Spike, and Smolder: [laughing]\n\n[theme song]\n\nSpike: Okay, I made a list of what cheers me up when I'm down, so if your brother's like me, he's gonna love it! What should we do first? The Smile Song? The sharing circle? Or friendship bracelet weaving?\nSmolder: I'm not sure those are the kind of things my brother's gonna be into.\nFluttershy: Well, what would make your brother happy?\nSmolder: Just having Spike and me accept him for who he is will make a huge difference. Dragons who appreciate his more sensitive side.\nSpike: I got it! Show tunes!\nSmolder: Yeah, no, but good try.\n\nFluttershy: [sniffs] Oh! Uh... [through plugged nose] That's an interesting smell.\nSmolder: [inhales, sighs] The stink of sulfur. Sharp rocks under my claws. [sighs] It's good to be home.\nSpike: I can't wait to meet your brother, Smolder. We're gonna be best buddies. I just know it.\nSmolder: He usually hangs out near here. I'll go try and find him.\nFluttershy: Spike, do you mind if I take a peek at the cute little baby eggs?\nSpike: No problem. I'll stay here and finish this comfort blanket. It'll be like a hug every time Smolder's brother wraps it around himself.\nFluttershy: Awww. I'm sure he'll love it, Spike.\n\nFluttershy: [gasps] Oh... my... goodness! Good morning, little one. I've come a long way to meet you. Did you know there's a whole wide world out here waiting to say hello? Did you? Oh, did you, boo? [baby talk]\nEmber: It can't answer you. It's an egg.\nFluttershy: Ah, Dragon Lord Ember. How nice to see you.\nEmber: Nice to see you too... uh... Which one are you again? The party one? Apple Dash! Or was that the country one?\nFluttershy: Fluttershy. The one who loves creatures. Are... all these yours?\nEmber: What?! No! None of them are. Watching over eggs is just part of the glamorous life of a Dragon Lord.\nFluttershy: I think it sounds wonderful.\nEmber: Yeah? Then maybe you can help.\nFluttershy: [gasps] I'd love to! Just tell me what to do!\nEmber: I don't know. It's my first time being in charge. Dad wasn't big on sharing Dragon Lord details. It's kind of a \"burn or be burned\" job.\nFluttershy: Well, I'm sure you're doing great.\nEmber: Not really. The eggs should've hatched by now. But none of them have even cracked.\nFluttershy: Oh, dear. Maybe they're lonely? Don't you worry. Auntie Fluttershy's here. And the Dragon Lord and I are gonna do everything we can to welcome you into this world.\nEmber: Really? How?\nFluttershy: Um... I have no idea.\n\nSpike: Now, that's a thing of beauty. Whoa!\nGarble: Well, if it isn't our little pony friend Spike.\nSpike: That's Equestria's official friendship ambassador to the Dragon Lands to you! And I'm not little! I had the molt. See?\nGarble and Dragons: [laughing]\nGarble: Oh-ho-ho, runt's got wings. I'm soooo impressed. What's that supposed to be?\nSpike: Nothing! Aah! [grunts]\nGarble: Looks like a baby blanket to me.\nSpike: It's not a baby blanket. It's a... comfort blanket.\nGarble and Dragons: [laughing]\nGarble: Awwww. Did your pony pals make it for you with friendship and gumdrops?\nSpike: No. I made it. And by the way, knitting's a lot harder than it looks.\nGarble: Check out the baby blanket, guys! It's a lot harder than it looks! [laughs] Got your bwanky!\n\"Billy\": Aw, little baby crying?\nSpike: [panting]\nGarble: Oh! Missed!\nSpike: [panting]\n\"Billy\": Bet he broke a claw and everything. [laughs]\nClump: [laughs]\nSpike: Give it back! That's for my friend!\nGarble and Dragons: [laughing]\n[flames roaring]\nSpike: Cut it out! You know laugh fire's dangerous! It can\u2014!\n[burning sounds]\nSpike: ...do that.\nSmolder: Garble!\nGarble: Smolder? What are you doing here?\n[high-fives]\nClump: How's it scalin', brah?\nSpike: [whispering] We'd better get out of here before your brother shows up. Garble isn't very nice to sensitive dragons.\nSmolder: But Garble is my brother.\nSpike: Your brother?!\nGarble: Got a problem with that, pony-boy?\nSpike: Oh, brother. [teeth chattering]\n\nSpike: [whimpering]\nSmolder: I've missed you, bro. We got a lot of fun to catch up on. There's no lava diving at school.\nClump: Good luck gettin' Garble to do anything.\n\"Billy\": Heh, yeah. He's gotten so weird since you left. Hiding and moping around...\nGarble: I have not!\nClump, \"Billy\", and Fume: Have so!\nSmolder: Easy, guys. I learned at Twilight's school ganging up on each other isn't half as cool as you think.\nClump: Awww. Pony school made you soft.\nSmolder: Want to try me and find out?\nClump: [gulps] M-Maybe later.\nSpike: So, uh, let's get lava diving. What do you say?\n\"Billy\": Better stay here, shrimp. Lava might ruin your blanky-wanky.\nGarble: Let the wimp tag along. Then we'll have somedragon to dunk! [laughs]\nSmolder: Hmph. Only gonna warn you once. Spike's my friend. You mess with him, you mess with me. Besides, he came here to hang out with you, Garble.\n[beat]\nClump, \"Billy\", and Fume: [laughing]\n[flames roaring]\n\"Billy\": [mockingly] Awww. How sweet. Ha!\nClump: Let's go do dragon stuff. Garble can have fun with his new friend.\nClump, \"Billy\", and Fume: [laughing]\n[flames roaring]\nGarble: But I'm not having fun! And he's not my friend! [growls]\nSmolder: Eh, just ignore them, \"Gar-Gar\".\nGarble: Smolder! Not in public!\nSpike: Oh, it's okay to have a nickname. Sometimes I'm called \"Spikey-Wikey\".\nGarble: Seriously? You're admitting this? [to Smolder] I am not hanging out with him.\nSmolder: Give him a chance, Garble. You guys have a lot in common.\nGarble: [groans] Fine. Race you to the lava pit.\nSpike: Wait. I thought you said your brother was sweet.\nSmolder: All the tough guy stuff is just an act. He's a big marshmallow.\nSpike: Yeah, not seein' it.\nSmolder: Well, maybe a burnt marshmallow. Smoky on the outside, but squishy inside. He just needs friends who can appreciate that part. Like you. You're not changing your mind about helping me cheer him up, are you?\nSpike: Me? 'Course not! [nervous laugh, sighs]\n\nSmolder: Okay! Lava jumping! Just like old times, huh, Gar-Gar?\nGarble: Yeah. Just like old times. Except for one little annoying thing.\nSmolder: Scales away!\n[splash]\nSmolder: Come on in! The lava's fine!\nGarble: [sighs]\nSpike: You know, whenever I'm feeling a little down, it always helps if I do something with a friend. How about we jump together?\n[smack!]\nSpike: Aah!\n[splash]\n[bubbling]\nSmolder: Ooh... [winces] Spike? You okay?\nSpike: [gasps] [stuffed] Uh, I know there must be something worse than lava up your nose. Ah... ah... [sneezes] I just don't know what it is.\nGarble: Cannonball!\n[whistling through air]\nSpike: Aah!\n[splash!]\nGarble: Woo-hoo! [laughs] Oops?\nSpike: Ah! [coughing] [strained] Swallowing lava. Swallowing lava's definitely worse.\nGarble: [insincere] My bad.\n\nFluttershy: [reading] \"...And then they all lived happily ever after.\" Time to come out, little ones. [baby talk] Maybe you'd like a song? [deep breath]\nEmber: I think you might be encouraging them to stay in. Dragons aren't much for touchy-feely stuff.\nFluttershy: Oh. I'm sorry.\n[rattling]\nFluttershy: [gasps] Goodness. Why are the eggs shaking? [gasps] Are they finally hatching?\nEmber: I wish. They've been doing that for days. I'm sure it means something, but it's probably not good.\n\nSpike: Try this. Red velvet. Guaranteed to brighten anycreature's spirits.\n[smack!]\n[splat!]\n[squish!]\nGarble: Feelin' better already.\n\nSpike: I dunno about you, but a change of scenery always turns my frown upside-down. Aah!\n[flump!]\nSpike: [under breath] I will be the bigger dragon. I will be the bigger dragon. I will be the bigger dragon. I will be the bigger dragon.\n\nSpike: Sometimes, just hearing what someone appreciates about you can make you feel better about yourself.\nSmolder: I'll go first. Spike, I think it's really nice that you're trying to cheer up Gar-Gar.\nGarble: [groans]\nSpike: Thank you, Smolder. My turn. I like how you always let everycreature know how you're feeling, Gar-Gar.\nGarble: Only Smolder gets to call me that!\nSpike: [pained groan] Thank you for speaking your truth. [groans]\n\nClump: More fresh lava comin' up!\n[crunching]\n[bubbling]\n[drain sound]\nSpike: Okay. New activity. Who wants to make vision boards?\n\"Billy\": Hey, Garble, Smolder! Surf's up!\n[splashing]\nGarble: Let me show you how it's done!\n[splashing]\nSmolder: You coming?\nSpike: I'll... catch up with you.\n[splashing]\nSpike: [sighs]\nFluttershy: [sighs] Spike! There you are!\nSpike: Hey, Fluttershy.\nFluttershy: For a land that's all rocks, this place is surprisingly easy to get lost in.\nSpike: How are the baby dragons doing?\nFluttershy: The eggs won't hatch. They just keep shaking. I'm starting to think the dragons are too scared to come out. I was hoping you could help. If you're not too busy cheering up Smolder's brother.\nSpike: Not a chance. Smolder's brother is Garble.\nFluttershy: [gasps]\nSpike: The only thing that cheers him up is to make me miserable.\nGarble: Hey, Spike! Want to play lavaball?\n[whoosh!]\nSpike: Huh?\n[glop!]\n[sizzle!]\nFluttershy: Excuse me, but that's not a very nice game!\nGarble and Dragons: [grunting, laughing]\n[glop! glop! glop!]\nClump: Ah! Nearly got you!\nFluttershy: [echoing] ENOUGH!\n[splashes]\nFluttershy: [clears throat] I mean, leave my friend alone please. Spike came all this way to cheer up Garble, which was a very kind thing to do.\n\"Billy\": [to Garble, mockingly] Awwww, do you need cheering up?\nClump: What's wrong, Garble? Did somedwagon hurt your wittle feelings?\nGarble: No! I-I don't know what she's talking about! Spike's the one who's gonna cry!\nSmolder: Hey! Are we lava surfing or what?\nGarble: Uh, yeah, yeah! [nervous laugh] Let's go hang with a real dragon, not a pony wannabe!\nGarble and Dragons: [laughing]\nSpike: See? It's no use. [sighs] Why don't I see what I can do about the eggs and you cheer up Garble? At least he listens to you.\nFluttershy: Just you wait, Garble. You're dealing with Fluttershy now, and she's packin' a whole lifetime of kindness!\n\nEmber: Oh... Coochie-coochie-coo. [groans] Coochie-coochie-coo. Coochie-coochie-coo! Coochie-coochie. I said coochie\u2014!\nSpike: Uh, what are you doing?\nEmber: [gasps] Spike!\nSpike: Hi, Ember!\nEmber: Shouldn't you be doing whatever it is you do at Twilight's school?\nSpike: I wish. It's a long story. Wow. These eggs really do look scared.\n[rattling]\nSpike: Wait. Aren't the hatching grounds supposed to be hot?\nEmber: Uh, of course. There's a lake of molten lava under them. That's why the eggs are laid here. The heat makes them hatch.\nSpike: Then something's wrong. I don't think the eggs are shaking because they're afraid. They're cold.\nEmber: You're right! But what happened to the lava?\nSpike: I might have an idea.\n\nFluttershy: Garble! Smolder! Is anydragon there?\n[bongo drums]\nFluttershy: Oh, my. Are those... bongo drums?\nGarble: Fire, dragon. Wig and waggin'. Feelin' like I be saggin'.\nFluttershy: [gasps]\nSmolder: [snapping fingers] Oh, yeah. I dig.\n[bongo drums]\nGarble: Ragin' lava. Balaclava.\nSmolder: Huh?\nGarble: Aah!\n\nClump: Fresh lava comin' up!\n[bubbling]\n[splash]\nSpike: See? I wondered where that lava was coming from. They must be draining it from the underground lake.\nEmber: [growls]\n[loud thud]\nEmber: Put that rock back! Immediately!\nClump: Uh, yes, Dragon Lord Ember!\nEmber: How long have you been removing these boulders?\nClump: Uhhhh... a while.\n\"Billy\": It made our lava pool so nice and warm-like.\nEmber: [growls] It's supposed to be heating the eggs! Now they'll never hatch!\n\nDragons: [panicked grunts]\nClump: Sorry, Dragon Lord Ember!\n\"Billy\": We'll put the lava back! [panicked grunts]\nClump: [panicked grunts] Here you go, lava! Come on! So difficult! And liquid-y!\nSpike: I don't think it works that way. The hatching grounds can't be the only warm place in the Dragon Lands. There's got to be somewhere else we can take the eggs.\nEmber: You know how fragile those things are? No way we'll be able to move them all safely. [growls] You! Go and bring all the dragons to the hatching grounds! We'll have to make the heat ourselves!\n\nGarble: What do you think you're doing sneaking around here, pony?!\nFluttershy: Sneaking? Looks to me like the only one sneaking around is you, Garble. Why didn't you tell me you were a poet?\nGarble: I'm not!\nFluttershy: [gasps]\n[bongo drum taps]\n[bongo drums]\nFluttershy: Words. Rhythm. Sometimes rhyme. Weird punctu... ation. Sure sounds like poetry to me.\nSmolder: It's okay, Gar-Gar. Fluttershy won't think you're soft for being a poet. And neither would anydragon who was your real friend.\nGarble: [sighs] 'Kay, fine. But I'm not a flowery, namby-pamby poet! I'm a beat poet. Dig?\nFluttershy: I totally feel you.\nGarble: And you better not tell my friends about it!\nFluttershy: But why? If I was a poet, I'd want to share my creations with everypony.\nSmolder: I'm the only one Garble will perform for. He hasn't written any poetry since I left. That's why he's been so sad.\nGarble: I need to create. But if the other dragons ever found out I like this junk, they'd make fun of me forever.\nFluttershy: Is that why you pick on Spike? To make your friends think you're tough?\nSmolder: Wait. You've been picking on Spike?\nGarble: Uh... only when you're not looking. But if I didn't pick on Spike, they'd just pick on me! And he is kind of a weakling.\nFluttershy: Hmph! I'll have you know Spike is stronger than you are any day!\nGarble: Yeah, right! That little cupcake-making, blanket-cuddling pony-dragon? [laughs] Give me a break!\nFluttershy: [gasps] First of all, there's nothing wrong with being a pony! Second, Spike isn't afraid to be who he is, no matter what you or anycreature thinks! That's real strength! Not like some dragons I know.\nSmolder: For a pony without a horn, she's sure got a point.\nSpike: I've been looking all over for you guys! We need your help! Hurry!\n[zip!]\n\n[flames roaring]\nEmber: I've ordered everydragon to warm up the eggs, but they still won't hatch. I don't know what else we can try.\nSpike: We can't give up! There's got to be something we can do!\nClump: [mockingly] How about we wrap the eggs in a bunch of baby bwankets? [laughs]\n\"Billy\": [laughs] Yeah! The wimp can knit 'em up quick-like!\nSpike: Hey, watch it! That laugh fire could burn somepony!\nDragons: [laughing]\nGarble: Burn... Good idea, Spikey-Wikey!\n[zip!]\nDragons: [stop laughing]\n[bongo drums]\nGarble: Eggs, come. Burst into that light. Break through shells that bind.\nSpike: [snaps fingers]\nGarble: Break free, explore. Stuck! ...Between rock and... hard place.\n[beat]\nDragons: [laughing]\n[flames roaring]\nGarble: Freedom, come! Don't be shy! Look those others in the eye!\nDragons: [uproarious laughing]\n[flames roaring]\nGarble: Stake your claim! Don't stop! Just do! Be the one and only... you!\nDragons: [uproarious laughing]\n[cracking]\nFluttershy: Spike, look!\nSpike: What? Huh?! Their laugh fire's so hot, it's hatching the eggs!\nGarble: Come to light! Proud to be! Open up! Bam! Be... free!\nDragons: [uproarious laughing]\n[cracking]\nSmolder: You did it, Gar-Gar! You performed in front of other dragons!\n\"Billy\": [laughs] And it was super lame! What kind of weakling writes poetry?\nEmber: The hero of the Dragon Lands! That's who!\nSmolder: Yeah! Garble saved our eggs because he was strong enough to be who he is, whether you liked it or not. I grew up thinking it was okay to make fun of differences. But my friends have taught me to celebrate them.\nDragons: [grunting]\nEmber: And from now on, in my kingdom, that's exactly what we will do. Now, if you don't mind, can you teach me how to write poetry like that? It's pretty cool.\nGarble: Uh... yeah, sure. No problem!\n\"Billy\": Yeah, me, too!\nClump: I want to learn!\nSpike: Take a number, guys.\nFluttershy: I'll take them all!

A harvest a hundred moons in the makin'. When every apple comes ripe at the same time. Big Mac's been up late workin' on this schedule so we can be sure not to miss a single tree. All it'll take now is a few days o' hard work. Who's with me?\nBig McIntosh: [snoring]\nApple Bloom: [groans] That looks like a lot of work.\nGranny Smith: Aw, don't you worry, chick-a-bidee. We got this Confluence under control. I got us some help.\nApplejack: That's great, Granny! Twilight and the others are too busy at the school to lend a hoof. We could sure use some more muscle. Who'd you get? Braeburn? Honeycrisp?\nGranny Smith: [chuckles] Even better.\n[muffed meowing]\n[thud]\n[door opens]\n[cats meowing]\nGoldie Delicious: Howdy, y'all!\n[scritching]\nBig McIntosh: [pained yelling]\n[thud]\nGoldie Delicious: Mm-hmm. Now, that's how you wake a pony up.\nApple Bloom: Goldie Delicious!\nGoldie Delicious: Granny told me y'all could use a helpin' hoof with this here Confluence, so I came a-runnin'.\nApplejack: Well, with a harvest this big, we're grateful for all the help we can get. I guess.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nGoldie Delicious: It's too bad y'all ain't ever caught the Great Seedling. He'd have granted you a perpetual harvest, Confluence or no.\nApplejack and Big McIntosh: [laugh]\nApplejack: The Great Seedlin'? Well now. I haven't thought about that old mare's tale for years.\nGoldie Delicious: The Great Seedlin' ain't no mare's tale! He's a magical Earth spirit...\n\nGoldie Delicious: [narrating] All the colors of the harvest that travels from farm to farm daring ponies to catch him. And those that have the ingenuity are rewarded with crops that are always in bloom.\n\nGoldie Delicious: And he's as real as you and me!\nGranny Smith: As I'm up to recall, Apple Bloom used to love settin' traps for the Great Seedlin' when she was a young'un. [laughs]\nBig McIntosh: [laughs]\nApplejack: Well, I'm pretty sure she's outgrown the whole thing by now. Right, Apple Bloom?\n[beat]\nApple Bloom: Or maybe I'm big enough now to finally catch him! Who's with me?!\n\n[theme song]\n\nApplejack: Apple Bloom, you haven't hunted for the Great Seedlin' since you were little. Why would you want to start again now?\nApple Bloom: The Confluence is so big! He's bound to show up! And if we catch him, he'll make all the apples ripe all the time! Right, Goldie?\nGoldie Delicious: Mm-hmm. That's right, young filly.\nApple Bloom: [laughs] Just imagine. Sweet Apple Acres would be the busiest orchard in Equestria! Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do!\n[door opens]\nApplejack: Don't forget we have actual work to do, too!\nGoldie Delicious: Nothin' like a little filly enjoyin' the harvest. [chuckles]\nApplejack: I don't mind Apple Bloom havin' fun. But there's honest-to-goodness work to do that doesn't have a thing to do with an old legend.\nGranny Smith: Aw, quit worryin', sugar booger. Apple Bloom can hunt for the Seedlin' all she wants. If you're so fret-a-fied about work, why don't you and your brother get to buckin' your own selves?\nApplejack: Granny's right.\n[cat yowls]\nApplejack: Come on, sleepyhead. Let's get to work.\nBig McIntosh: [yawns] Eeyup...\n[cat yowls]\n\n[thud]\nApplejack: Hyah! Hwah!\n[apples thudding]\nGranny Smith: [chuckles] ...and if you had two o' them, it would've been a \"pair o' pears\"!\nGranny Smith and Goldie Delicious: [laughing]\n[crack]\nApplejack: As much as I appreciate her volunteerin', I'm not sure how much help Goldie's gonna be.\nGoldie Delicious: Oh, now, that reminds me of the time Dottie \u2013 that's my cheetah, you understand \u2013 she found out where I keep the catnip.\nGranny Smith and Goldie Delicious: [laughing]\nApplejack: I love hearin' her and Granny spinnin' yarns, but it looks like the harvestin's up to us. You're gonna have to redo that schedule.\nBig McIntosh: [sighs] Eeyup.\nApplejack: And as much as I'd rather Apple Bloom were helpin', I guess there's no harm in her huntin' the Great Seedlin' for a day. Right? Big Mac!\nBig McIntosh: [snores, yells]\n[thud]\n[whip!]\nBig McIntosh: [yells]\nApple Bloom: Gotcha! Awww. You ain't the Great Seedlin'.\nBig McIntosh: Nope.\n[whap!]\n\n[rooster crows]\n[sizzling]\nApplejack: We fell behind a bit yesterday, so we need everypony at their best.\n[cat meows]\nGoldie Delicious: If that's your brother's best, we might be done for. Mm-hmm.\n[hooves rattling]\n[thud]\nApplejack: He was just up late workin' out a new schedule so we can stay on track.\nApple Bloom: I didn't sleep either! I was too excited! I can't wait to see if I caught the Great Seedlin'!\n[door opens]\nApplejack: I hope you're ready to cheer Apple Bloom up when her traps come up empty.\nApple Bloom: Everypony! Come quick! You got to see!\nApplejack: What in blazes is all the excitement about?\nApple Bloom: Look!\n[whimsical music]\nApple Bloom: The Great Seedlin' did this! Didn't he?!\nGoldie Delicious: Well, braid my mane! These sure look like Great Seedlin' tracks to me!\nApple Bloom: Ha! I knew it! He was here! The Great Seedlin' was here! Ain't that amazin', Applejack?!\nApplejack: Yeah... Amazin'...\nGoldie Delicious: [laughs]\n\nApple Bloom: [gasps] Isn't it beautiful? I just can't believe the Great Seedlin' was really here!\nApplejack: Neither can I.\nApple Bloom: What do you think this means?\nGoldie Delicious: [laughs] Well, it looks to me like a challenge. The Seedling wants you to know that he was here, and he's daring you to catch him. Mm-hmm.\nApple Bloom: You think I still have a chance?\nGranny Smith: You're an Apple, ain't ya?\nGoldie Delicious: Why, if you set enough traps, you're bound to catch him.\nApple Bloom: You're right! And that's just what I'm gonna do! Look out, Great Seedlin'! Here I come! [giggles]\nGranny Smith and Goldie Delicious: [laughing]\nApplejack: Now, why would you go and do a thing like that?\nGoldie Delicious: A thing like what?\nApplejack: You know what I mean. We got enough work to do without you distractin' Apple Bloom by makin' some apple tracks and pretendin' the Great Seedlin' did it.\nGoldie Delicious: [gasps] I did no such thing!\nGranny Smith: What in the tater tarnation would make you say a thing like that?!\nApplejack: Well, somepony did it. And she sure seems to be enjoyin' this quite a lot.\nGoldie Delicious: I'm enjoyin' it because Apple Bloom's enjoyin' it!\nApplejack: Uh-huh. And I suppose you two didn't do it either?\nBig McIntosh: Nnnope.\nGranny Smith: O' course not. But I suppose it could've been Goldie's cats! Why don't you ask them?\n[cat meows]\nGoldie Delicious: Have you considered that maybe it was the Great Seedlin' after all?\nApplejack: Ha-ha. Very funny.\nGranny Smith: I swear, sometimes I think she's part mule.\n\n[clattering]\nApplejack: Apple Bloom?\nApple Bloom: You know where there's more rope? I've got a lot of traps to make if I'm gonna catch the Great Seedlin'.\n[toy squeaks]\nApplejack: That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I know you're excited, but we sure could use your help today. Are you sure you want to spend time tryin' to catch somethin' that... might not even be real?\nApple Bloom: What? But the Great Seedlin' is real. You saw the tracks. You think those appeared all by themselves?\nApplejack: I don't know who made the tracks. But I don't think it was the Great Seedlin'.\nApple Bloom: Why not?\nApplejack: Because the Great Seedlin' is just somethin' to make the harvest fun for young'uns. And you're old enough now to know that there's a time for fun and there's a time for work.\nApple Bloom: But catchin' the Great Seedlin' is helpin'! He can make the trees blossom all the time!\nApplejack: [sighs] All right. How about this? If you help me with the harvest today, I'll help you set traps for the Great Seedlin' tonight. Deal?\nApple Bloom: Woo-hoo! Yes! It's a deal!\n\n[apples thudding]\n[barrels creaking]\n[thunk!]\n[apples thudding]\nApplejack: Kinda looks like those Seedlin' tracks, huh?\nApple Bloom: Sure. If there were hundreds of apples in a bunch of different lines.\nApplejack: Well, if enough apples fell or got knocked down by the wind maybe. Or animals.\n[beat]\nApplejack: I'm just sayin' there's a lot of possible explanations.\nGoldie Delicious: And one o' them is the Great Seedlin'!\nApplejack: And the rest of 'em ain't!\nGranny Smith: That ain't what you thought when you was a foal.\nApple Bloom: What does that mean?\nGranny Smith: Your sister was plumb loco about catchin' the Great Seedlin' when she was your age. Same as you are now. Worse, even.\nGoldie Delicious: Oh, is that so? Do tell, Granny.\nGranny Smith: Well, it must've been the last Conflu-inky, I reckon. I was supposed to keep an eye on your sister, but...\n\nGranny Smith: [voiceover] ...she was slipperier than an apple seed.\nGranny Smith: Applejack! Get your flank back here! You're supposed to be sortin' in the barn!\nYoung Applejack: Sorry, Granny! I got to check my traps, or the Great Seedlin' might get away!\n[leaves rustling]\nYoung Applejack: Now, where'd I put that trap?\n[twig snaps]\nYoung Applejack: [gasps] Whoa!\n[thud]\nGranny Smith: Bust my buds. Where's that young'un get to?\nGranny Smith: [voiceover] She spent the better half of the day stuck in that trap! [laughs]\nApplejack: [voiceover] And missed out on helpin' with the harvest because I was chasin' somethin' for little foals. I felt guilty everypony else had to work harder because of me. So I decided right then and there I was too old to waste any more time on Great Seedlin'.\n\nGranny Smith: Oh, we finished the harvest just fine. But we laughed about that story for years! [laughs]\nGoldie Delicious: [laughs] I'm still laughin'!\nApple Bloom: I'm sorry that happened, Applejack, but it won't if you and me set traps together like you promised. Plus, we'll get 'em done twice as fast and won't miss out on any of the harvest!\nApplejack: Then let's get to work.\nApple Bloom: [gasps]\n\n[montage music]\n[rope stretching]\n[twang!]\n[snap!]\n[crunch!]\n\n[leaves rustling]\n[thud]\n[apples thudding]\n[cats meowing]\nWinona: [barking, yelps]\n[thud]\nWinona: [panting]\n\n[tree straining]\n[twang!]\n[thud]\n\n[cans clattering]\n[leaves rustling]\n\nApple Bloom: [laughs] It sure was fun settin' up all those traps together.\nApplejack: [laughs] I forgot what a good time it could be. If any two ponies can catch the Great Seedlin', it's us.\nApple Bloom: I can't wait to check in the mornin'.\nApplejack: Now, there's still plenty of harvestin' to do. So promise me you'll help, even if all our traps are empty.\nApple Bloom: I promise. So long as you're ready for the bountiful harvest the Great Seedlin's gonna give us when one of our traps nab him!\nApplejack: [laughs] Deal.\n[door opens]\n\n[rooster crows]\n[rumbling]\nApplejack and Apple Bloom: [panting]\nApple Bloom: Come on, Applejack! If we hurry, we can check every trap and still stay on schedule!\nApplejack: Now that's what I like to hea\u2014\n[whimsical music]\nApplejack: Whoa.\nApple Bloom: [gasps] I don't believe it!\nGoldie Delicious: This must've taken all night.\n[smack!]\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nApple Bloom: Nothin'!\nApplejack: Huh?\nApple Bloom: I checked all the traps near the tracks! Every one was sprung, but they're all empty!\nApplejack: Every trap sprung? No way critters did this. Or the wind. I can't believe I'm sayin' this, but... maybe the Great Seedlin' really was here!\n\nGoldie Delicious: So, you're finally ready to admit the Great Seedling might be real?\nApplejack: I can't think of anything else that could've laid out these tracks and sprung all our traps.\nApple Bloom: And if he left this many tracks behind, he's practically beggin' us to catch him!\nGranny Smith: I ain't never seen anything like this before.\nApplejack: Well, tell us what you have seen! Goldie, you too! We need to know it all if we're really gonna catch him!\nGranny Smith: Sure, Goldie and I'll tell you all about the Great Seedling all day. While we work.\nApplejack: Work? Apple Bloom and I don't have time to work today! We've got to set up traps in every row! Even the carrots! Just to be sure!\nApple Bloom: Yesterday you said the Great Seedlin' was just somethin' to make the harvest fun for young'uns.\nApplejack: That was before I thought we could actually catch him! Besides...\nBig McIntosh: [yawns]\nApplejack: ...Big Mac can make time in the schedule for us to set traps, right?\nBig McIntosh: Uh... eeyup?\nApplejack: Great! Get to it! Apple Bloom and I are gonna go capture us the Great Seedlin'!\n\nBig McIntosh: [sighs]\n[thud]\n[apples thudding]\n[multiple thuds]\n[apples thudding]\n[barrel creaking]\nBig McIntosh: [wheezes]\n[multiple thuds]\n[thud]\n[leaves rustling]\nWinona: [barking]\nApplejack: Whew! All right! Just one more hill to go!\nApple Bloom: What's wrong, Big Mac?\nApplejack: Huh. Is this right?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nApplejack: But that doesn't make any sense. How can all these trees be bare if we haven't bucked 'em yet?\nGoldie Delicious: Seems like more work of the Great Seedlin' to me.\nApple Bloom: How do you mean?\nGoldie Delicious: The closer you get to catchin' the critter, the more mischievous he gets.\nApplejack: You're sayin' the Great Seedlin' is takin' our apples?\nGranny Smith: Yes. Sounds like he's fixin' to throw you off the scent.\n[thudding]\n[cats meowing]\nApplejack: Have you ever heard of anypony actually catchin' him?\nGoldie Delicious: Oh, there are stories. But it's hard to say for sure. He's quite a trickster. Guess that's why the reward is so great if you can trap him.\nApplejack: Well, his tricks have given me an idea. Settin' traps is one thing. But I reckon if we keep watch over the trees that haven't been bucked, the Seedlin' won't know what hit him!\nApple Bloom: That's a great idea! Anypony else want to stay up with us?\nGranny Smith: Ah, no. A pony like me needs her beauty rest. But you young'uns have a good time.\nGoldie Delicious: My kitties can't sleep unless they're curled up on my haunches. [titters] But I can't wait to see the Great Seedlin' with my own eyes once you catch him.\nApplejack: Guess it's just you and me.\n[paper tears]\n\nApple Bloom: Too bad nopony else wanted to come out. But I'm glad we're doin' this together.\nApplejack: [chuckles] Me, too. It's been a long time since I was on a real Seedlin' hunt. And this is the first time doin' it with my little sister.\nApple Bloom: [yawns] When did you start tryin' to catch the Great Seedlin'?\nApplejack: I couldn't have been much more than a foal. I remember our parents tuckin' Big Mac and me in and tellin' us all about the Great Seedlin'. And I got so excited, I could barely sleep. So I\u2014\nApple Bloom: [snoring]\nApplejack: Don't you worry, sugarcube. I won't let him get away.\n\nApplejack: [snoring]\n[clatter!]\nApple Bloom: [yelps]\n[thud]\n[apples thudding]\nApple Bloom: [whispering] Applejack, wake up!\nApplejack: Huh? W-What is it?\nApple Bloom: [whispering] I think a trap went off!\nApplejack: Well, let's go check it out!\n\nApplejack: See anything?\nApple Bloom: Mm-mm.\nApplejack: Don't scare him off. We got to lead him into one of the traps.\nApple Bloom: [whimpers] I'm not worried about scarin' him.\n[galloping]\n[twig snaps]\n[leaves rustling]\n[thud]\n[apples thudding]\n[cans clattering]\nApple Bloom: I think the Great Seedlin's huntin' us! [screams]\nApplejack: Apple Bloom! Wait!\nApple Bloom: [panting]\n[twang!]\nApplejack: [panting] Huh?\nApple Bloom: [whimpering] Applejack!\nApplejack: Huh?\nApplejack and Apple Bloom: [scream]\nApplejack: [panting]\n[thudding]\n[rattling]\nBig McIntosh: [snoring]\nApplejack and Apple Bloom: Big Mac?!\nApplejack: He's been harvestin' in his sleep this whole time!\nApple Bloom: Big Mac is the Great Seedlin'?!\nBig McIntosh: [mumbling] Aah!\n[whiffle!]\n[thud!]\nApplejack: Y-You okay, Big Mac?\nBig McIntosh: Nnnope.\nApplejack and Apple Bloom: [laugh]\n\nApplejack: ...And thanks to all of Big Mac's late-night work, we brought in the whole harvest with time to spare.\nGoldie Delicious: No wonder you were so tired all the time.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nApple Bloom: I'm glad we solved the mystery, but I really wanted to catch the Great Seedlin' before I get too old to try.\nApplejack: You know what, sugarcube? You're never too old to be a filly. There will always be work to do, but havin' fun together is somethin' you never grow out of.\nWinona: [panting]\nGoldie Delicious: Well, looks like you don't need me anymore. Time to get home before Dottie gets in the catnip again. I have stories about that, I'll tell you what.\nApplejack: [chuckles] We're real glad you came, Goldie.\nApple Bloom: Sure are! Come back next year!\nGoldie Delicious: [whistles]\n[cats meowing]\nGoldie Delicious: Oh. Looks like you forgot to clean up the carrots.\nApplejack: Huh. Big Mac wasn't harvestin' the carrots. Just the apples.\nBig McIntosh: [\"I-don't-know\" sound]\n[whimsical music]\nApplejack: You know what this means?\nApple Bloom: Time for another hunt!\nApplejack: Look out, Great Seedlin'! Here we come!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nTrixie: I know how hard you've been working lately, so I figured you could use a break.\nStarlight Glimmer: [gasps] Trixie, this looks amazing! But my job doesn't really seem like work.\n[bracelet chiming]\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh! Speaking of...\n[teleportation zap]\nTrixie: [sighs, blows, sips]\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Sure, being counselor for the students at Twilight's School of Friendship is demanding, but\u2014\n[bracelet chiming]\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh. One sec.\n[teleportation zap]\nTrixie: [sips]\n[spoon clattering]\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: What was I saying? Oh, right. Being able to use the experiences of my checkered past and help young students feels pretty great. Oh, yum! [chomps] Mmm, thanks!\nTrixie: Of course I feel nothing but admiration for the work you do, but it is a little all-consuming. And I miss spending time with you.\nStarlight Glimmer: What are you talking about? We're spending time right now.\nTrixie: Well...\nStarlight Glimmer: [chewing]\n[bracelet chiming]\nStarlight Glimmer: [mouth full] Hold that thought.\n[teleportation zap]\nTrixie: [growls, chomps]\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] Sorry. I cast a spell on the door to my office so this bracelet goes off whenever there's a knock. Yona is having the worst time with her braids lately. [sips] Anyway, you were saying?\nTrixie: [sips]\nStarlight Glimmer: [laughs nervously]\n\n[theme song]\n\nSilverstream: I totally respect my younger cousins' decisions to stay seaponies, but they've never been on dry land. Preparing for a visit with them is almost as much work as the research assignment Headmare Twilight gave me on hazardous fauna of the Everfree Forest! How would you describe a shower to creatures who live in water? So far, I've got \"warm\" and \"steamy\". Actually, steam has water in it.\nStarlight Glimmer: Silverstream, there are a lot of students who want to see me today.\nSilverstream: I just need a few shower adjectives... that don't rely on the wet part.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] Well, there's \"clean\", \"relaxing\", um...\nSilverstream: \"Relaxing\"... I don't know. A nap's relaxing, too. \"Warm\" and \"clean\" are okay. Wow. I have to give this some more thought.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh. Okay. Well, I'm here to help. My door is always open.\nTrixie: Except for today, of course.\n[door closes]\nStudent Pony: [whimpers]\nTrixie: If we leave now, we can finish everything before sundown.\nStarlight Glimmer: Trixie, I-I can't leave. It's almost spring break. Twilight and the others have already left to celebrate the spring solstice in Canterlot, and I have to help the students with any issues before they head home for the holiday.\n[bracelet chiming/knocking on door]\n[door opens]\n[door closes]\nTrixie: I know you're busy, but I hope you haven't forgotten about the Spring Solst-astic!\n[beat]\nTrixie: The party Maud and Mudbriar are throwing?\n[beat]\nTrixie: Sunburst is coming to town?\n[beat]\nTrixie: You and I promised to make the cake?\nStarlight Glimmer: [scoffs] How could I possibly forget about that?\n[bracelet chiming/knocking on door]\n[door opens]\nTrixie: [low growl]\n[door closes]\n\nTrixie: Nopony is saying your job isn't important, but plans you make with your friends are important, too.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs] I know. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have forgotten. Obviously I need to be available to my students, but that doesn't mean I can't help with all the things we have to do.\nTrixie: Good!\nStarlight Glimmer: Great!\n[beat]\nStarlight Glimmer: So... what are all the things we have to do?\nTrixie: [whines] Maud needs streamers for the decorations. Sunburst wants us to pick up a genuine pre-Equestrian spring solstice chafing dish from the antique shop.\nStarlight Glimmer: Of course he does.\nTrixie: Mudbriar wants a bouquet of flowering sticks \u2013 whatever that means. And I thought we were both looking forward to Mrs. Cake teaching us the secret recipe to her famous spring solstice cake.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh! I-I totally am! [chuckles] But we could just buy a cake from her, right?\nTrixie: We could... but then we'd miss out on baking together. Plus, the time I spent flattering and convincing and begging her to share the recipe with you for nothing! And we promised to make a cake, not buy a cake! And the Great and Powerful Trixie keeps her promises!\nStarlight Glimmer: Okay! Why don't we just split up these jobs? I'll get the streamers and the chafing dish. You\u2014\n[bracelet chiming]\nStarlight Glimmer: \u2014get started on those sticks, and I'll be right back! [laughs nervously] You know, why don't I just hang on to this? Wouldn't want to forget the things I just said I'd take care of. Because I am totally gonna take care of them!\n[teleportation zap]\n\nRose: Could it be plum blossom?\nTrixie: I have no idea.\n[teleportation zap]\nTrixie: [yelps]\n[thud]\nStarlight Glimmer: Whoops! Heh. Sorry, Rose. But I need a bouquet of flowering sticks, stat!\nTrixie: I thought I was getting the flowering sticks.\nRose: Uh, I'm still not exactly sure what they are.\nTrixie: No one is.\nStarlight Glimmer: Right. Got it. You get the sticks. I'll get the streamers\u2014\n[bracelet chiming]\nStarlight Glimmer: \u2014riiiight after I take care of what I'm sure is an even smaller student problem than the last one! [laughs nervously]\n[teleportation zap]\n[glue squirting]\n\nSilverstream: I think I have the shower thing under control. But I can't figure out how to describe a towel.\n\n[bracelet chiming]\n[teleportation zap]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Now, Smolder, I understand the school can be a bit drafty, but that doesn't mean you can breathe fire anywhere you want!\n\nStarlight Glimmer: What do you mean Trixie already picked up Sunburst's genuine pre-Equestrian equinox chafing dish?! That was my job! I think. Wait. Was it?\n[bracelet chiming]\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans]\n[teleportation zap]\n\n[transformation zaps]\nStarlight Glimmer: Ocellus, it's perfectly normal for a changeling to struggle with identity issues, but\u2014\nSilverstream: Counselor Starlight!\n[door opens]\nSilverstream: When you're done, I need some synonyms for the word \"dry\". Or, really, just help explaining the concept.\n\n[door closes]\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Wait, Mrs. Cake! You can't close! Trixie and I need to learn the recipe for your equinox cake!\nMrs. Cake: Oh, it's fine, dear. Trixie was already here. I told her everything she needs to know.\nStarlight Glimmer: What? No! Aww! The Great and Powerful Trixie might keep her promises, but the Busy and Distracted Starlight sure doesn't. I promised to help her today, and I haven't done a single thing.\nMrs. Cake: Oh, that doesn't sound hard, dear. A-And I'm not quite sure how to tell you this, but [whispering] your hoof is glowing.\n[bracelet chiming]\nStarlight Glimmer: Of course it is.\n[teleportation zap]\n\n[teleportation zap]\n[click]\nStarlight Glimmer: Trixie? What are you doing here?\nTrixie: It's the one place I knew I could find you.\nStarlight Glimmer: I am so sorry about today. I'm just so\u2014\nTrixie: Busy. I know. Obviously your students are more important than your friends.\nStarlight Glimmer: That's not\u2014!\n[bracelet chiming/knocking on door]\n[door opens]\nSilverstream: Starlight, you have a minute?\nStarlight Glimmer: Actually, Silverstream, I don't. Besides, I need to lock up the school for the holiday, and it's time you caught the train home. I'm sure a smart and capable student like you can figure out the solution to any problem over the break. But for now, the counselor's office is closed.\n[door closes]\nStarlight Glimmer: I have a cake to bake.\n\n[clatter]\nSunburst: Yow! Is this cake supposed to be so sharp?\nTrixie: [growls]\nSunburst: I mean, it looks really... interesting?\nMudbriar: Technically, it's not symmetrical or aesthetically pleasing.\nTrixie: [growls]\nStarlight Glimmer: Maybe it's not the best cake. But we made it together, and that's what counts.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I'm glad you brought it. And everything else. I'm very excited. This is going to be the most perfect party ever.\nTrixie: And with all of your students home for the holiday, I won't have to worry about you being summoned to your office in the middle of it.\nStarlight Glimmer: Mm-hmm. Nothing is gonna take me away from this party.\nTerramar: Hello?! Starlight?!\nStarlight Glimmer: [spits]\nTerramar: Starlight?!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Sorry. This is a private cavern.\nTerramar: Is Starlight here?! I was told she'd be here!\nStarlight Glimmer: What's wrong?\nTerramar: I'm Terramar, Silverstream's brother. I've been looking all over for you. Silverstream is missing!\nStarlight Glimmer: [gasps]\nTrixie: [chewing]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: I don't understand. Silverstream didn't come home?\nTerramar: Mm-mm. I was supposed to meet her at the Mount Aris train station, but she never showed up!\nSunburst: It's a long way between Ponyville and Mount Aris. She could be anywhere.\nTerramar: Our parents are leading teams of Hippogriffs and seaponies, searching the land and sea between here and our home. They sent me to check the school.\nStarlight Glimmer: But the school's closed. All the students are gone.\nTerramar: Are you sure? I know she had a big project due for Twilight. Do you think she might've stayed to finish it?\nStarlight Glimmer: She never told me about a project.\nTrixie: Well, to be fair, you closed your office the last time she came by.\nStarlight Glimmer: Really?\nTrixie: [short laugh]\nTerramar: What kind of counselor turns away a student with a problem?!\nTrixie: The kind with too much on her plate! Starlight has always gone out of her way for her students. And I mean always.\nStarlight Glimmer: Except apparently when it matters. This is all my fault! You all go back to the party. Terramar and I will check the school. We'll find your sister.\n[teleportation zap]\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I should've known it couldn't last. Party perfection is more of a Pinkie thing.\nMudbriar: Mm. I wasn't going to say anything, but these flowers are just glued on, so technically, it wasn't perfect already.\n[beat]\nMudbriar: But that's probably not important.\n\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: You check the grounds, and I'll look inside.\n\n[doors open]\nStarlight Glimmer: Silverstream?\n[teleportation zap]\n\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: [echoing] Hello?\n[teleportation zap]\n\n[teleportation zaps]\nStarlight Glimmer: Anycreature?!\n\n[splash]\n[teleportation zap]\nTerramar: [panting] She's not down here.\nStarlight Glimmer: I don't see her anywhere.\nTerramar: Did you check her room?\n[teleportation zap]\n\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, she's not here.\nTerramar: No, she isn't. But look at this.\nStarlight Glimmer: A cockatrice?\nTerramar: Could that be what her project was on? You don't think she went into the Everfree Forest to find a cockatrice by herself, do you?\nStarlight Glimmer: I don't know, but I'm going to find out.\n[teleportation zap]\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: [laughs nervously]\n[teleportation zap]\n\n[teleportation zap]\nAll: [yelps]\nStarlight Glimmer: What are you all doing here?\nSunburst: We came to help.\nTrixie: We couldn't let you handle this alone.\nMudbriar: Technically, she wasn't alone.\n[beat]\nMudbriar: But we wanted to help anyway.\nStarlight Glimmer: Thanks. All of you. But the students are my responsibility. I'm the one who didn't do my job when it actually mattered.\nTrixie: I... might share a bit of the blame for pressuring you into leaving work early.\nStarlight Glimmer: But I don't want to ruin your party.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] We can still have a party. A search party.\nTerramar: Can we talk about all this later? Silverstream might be in the Everfree Forest alone!\nTrixie and Sunburst: [gasp]\nStarlight Glimmer: We think she went in to do research on cockatrices.\nSunburst: What?! The gaze of the cockatrice is known to petrify any who dare to cross its path! And the reptilian birds are elusive and solitary! W-Where would we even start?!\nTrixie: I have a lot of experience telling ponies that I have experience with the dangerous creatures of Everfree Forest! Follow me!\n[zip!]\n\n[tense music]\nTrixie: The Great and Directionally Astute Trixie says we go left!\n\nTrixie: This way!\n\nTrixie: [sniffs]\n[wind whistling]\n\n[owl hoots]\n\nTrixie: [slurp, chews, spits]\n\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Weren't we just here?\nStarlight Glimmer: Trixie, do you have any idea how to find a cockatrice?\nTrixie: No. But usually, when there's a dangerous creature in the forest I don't want to meet, this is how I meet them.\nSunburst: We might need a more concrete plan.\nTrixie: Hmph. Suit yourself.\nTerramar: Um, according to Silverstream's research, the cockatrice prefers rocky terrain and ample shade.\nTrixie: Rocks and shade. Hmm. I can't imagine where we'll find that in a forest.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Actually, rocks aren't the most hospitable environment for shade trees.\nMudbriar: Technically, pine trees like Pinus cembra or Pinus sylvestris can grow from narrow crevasses or cracks in a rocky rhizosphere.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] You complete me.\nStarlight Glimmer: There's some pine trees over there!\n\n[cockatrices clucking and hissing]\nStarlight Glimmer: [whispering] I thought you said they were solitary!\nSunburst: [whispering] They are! This must be some kind of migration.\nTerramar: [whimpers] At least there's no sign of Silverstream. I can't imagine getting caught in the middle of that flock.\nTrixie: [whispering] It's just lucky we're all over here and they're all over there.\n[cockatrice hisses]\nMudbriar: Technically\u2014\nTrixie: [whispering] Don't even say it!\nStarlight Glimmer: Whatever you do, don't look at them. Their gaze can turn you to stone.\nTerramar: [whispering] So what do we do?\n[cockatrices hiss]\nSunburst: Ruuuuun!\n[teleportation zap]\n\n[cockatrices squawk]\nSunburst: [screaming]\n[thud]\nSunburst: [groans, babbles]\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Sunburst!\n[magic zap]\nStarlight Glimmer and Sunburst: Aah!\nStarlight Glimmer: Stop! It's me!\nSunburst: Starlight! I'm so sorry. We have to get out of here.\nStarlight Glimmer: I know. Hang on.\n[teleportation zap]\n\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: We can't leave Silverstream might still be in the forest. Stay here. I'll get the others.\n[teleportation zap]\nSunburst: Be careful!\n\n[clucking and hissing]\nTerramar: The clucking is coming from everywhere!\nTrixie: The Great and Powerful Trixie fears no cluck!\n[poof!]\n[cockatrices hiss]\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Come on!\n[teleportation zap]\n[cockatrices hiss]\n\n[teleportation zap]\nSunburst: Aah!\n[teleportation zap]\n\n[cockatrices hiss]\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Maud! We've got to get out of here!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I'm not leaving him.\nStarlight Glimmer: [gasps]\n[teleportation zap]\n\n[teleportation zap]\nTrixie, Sunburst, and Terramar: [gasps]\nSunburst: Mudbriar's been turned to stone?!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I didn't think I could love him any more.\nTrixie: We've got to get out of here!\nTerramar: But we haven't found Silverstream! We can't leave yet!\n[cockatrices hiss]\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, we can't stay here! Come on!\n[cockatrices hissing]\n[leaves rustling]\n[cockatrice clucks]\nStarlight Glimmer: [screams]\n[cockatrices hissing]\nStarlight Glimmer: This way!\n[cockatrices hiss]\n[doors open]\n[doors close]\n[thudding]\nTrixie: Now what?!\nSunburst: Let's hope Silverstream found a good place to hide. There could be hundreds more cockatrices on the way. If this really is a migration, it'll take a full lunar cycle to complete.\nTerramar: Ohhh. I have to get word back to our parents that Silverstream could be surrounded by those terrifying birds!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] And as handsome as Mudbriar is now, we should probably catch one of them to turn him back to normal.\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans] This is all my fault. I'm never taking time off from my counseling duties again.\nTrixie: That seems a little extreme.\nStarlight Glimmer: Really?! If I hadn't galloped off to a holiday celebration, Silverstream would be safe with her family, and you'd all be enjoying Maud's party! Instead, my student is missing, we're surrounded by a flock of petrifying chicken-snakes, and Maud's boyfriend was turned into a hunk of rock!\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] You got the \"hunk\" part right.\nStarlight Glimmer: And to top it off, we have no idea if Silverstream even came to Everfree at all! But I have no idea where else to look!\nTrixie: Has that always been there?\nStarlight Glimmer: What? Oh, that's the students' treehouse. Apparently it grew from the Tree of Harmony and\u2014 [gasps] Of course! That should've been the first place we looked!\n[scraping]\n[door opens]\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs, gasps] Silverstream, look out!\nSilverstream: Counselor Starlight, no!\nEdith: [hisses]\nSilverstream: Wait!\n[magic humming]\nEdith: [clucking softly]\nSilverstream: This is Edith. She's helping me with my project.\nStarlight Glimmer: I... don't understand.\nSilverstream: After you encouraged me to solve my own problem, I decided to get my project done before I left. That way, I could really focus on my family during my visit. The school was closed, so I came here.\nTerramar: Why didn't you tell anyone? Mom and Dad are worried sick!\nSilverstream: Oh, no! I'm so sorry! Once Edith volunteered to help, I guess I lost track of time. Cockatrices are really friendly if you know how to interact with them.\nEdith: [clucking softly]\nSunburst: I can't believe you figured out how to trigger her nesting response.\nSilverstream: They are really fascinating creatures. Did you know that they migrate to the Everfree Forest once a year? Can you imagine what would happen if you stumble on a whole flock of these?\nStarlight Glimmer: I have a few ideas.\nSilverstream: [gasps]\n\nSilverstream: I'm sorry you got turned to stone looking for me. But I'm glad Edith was able to turn you back.\nSunburst: [hushed, to Trixie] How do you tell the difference?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] I have mixed feelings about it.\nMudbriar: Technically, I will always be a stick pony. But the experience has given me an even deeper appreciation for the density and permanence of rock.\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] Swoon.\nTerramar: Silverstream and I should get going. But I wanted to thank you for everything you did to help find her.\nStarlight Glimmer: I just wish I hadn't abandoned her in the first place.\nTrixie: Starlight, you didn't abandon her.\nStarlight Glimmer: I might as well have. Even though it turned out all right, things could've been a lot worse.\nSunburst: You can't be expected to supervise your students every second of every day.\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm not so sure.\nSilverstream: I like that you're always available, but it kind of makes it okay to come to you with stuff that maybe isn't super important.\nTrixie: Of course being a school counselor is a big responsibility. But always being at work isn't fair to anypony. Especially me.\nStarlight Glimmer: Do you think if I had set times to see me, it might help you decide what you really need to talk about?\nSilverstream: To be honest, you really weren't very helpful with the other stuff anyway.\nStarlight Glimmer: Yeah\u2014 Wait, what?!\nTrixie: Happy Spring Solst-astic, everypony! Who wants a piece of Mrs. Cake's famous\u2014?\n[clang!]\nSunburst: Petrified dessert?\nMaud Pie: [deadpan] You had me at \"petrified\".\nAll except Maud Pie: [laughing]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nSkeedaddle: [panting] Cutie Mark Crusaders! Cutie Mark Crusaders! Cutie Mark Crusaders! Cutie Mark Crusaders!\nScootaloo: We're at my house!\n[door opens]\nSkeedaddle: I got my cutie mark!\nSweetie Belle: You did?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: That's great, Skeedaddle!\nScootaloo: Yeah! What's it for?\nSkeedaddle: Knot-tying! And I never would've gotten it without all of you!\nApple Bloom: Did we suggest knot-tying?\nSkeedaddle: [to Sweetie Belle] First, I tried sailing, like you said. [to Scootaloo] Next, I tried fishing, like you said. [to Apple Bloom] Then, I tried rowing, like you said. But my oar broke. So I used my fishing line to tie it back together, and I got my cutie mark! [squeals] I can't wait to tell everypony!\n[zip!]\n[door closes]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [cheer]\nAunt Holiday: Oh, how exciting. You three truly have a gift for helping ponies.\nScootaloo: Aw, thanks, Aunt Holiday. But I'm not sure we can take credit for this one.\nAunt Holiday: Of course you can. You encouraged that colt to try new things. And because you all believed in him, he succeeded.\nAuntie Lofty: I could use that kind of help. Huh.\nScootaloo: [laughs] Come on, Auntie Lofty. You already have your cutie mark.\nAuntie Lofty: Lot of good it does me. I can't decide what theme to give this quilt. Ah, I've run out of inspiration.\nApple Bloom: How about apples? Puppies? Kites!\nSweetie Belle: Or cotton candy! Or ballet!\nScootaloo: What about a Wonderbolt quilt?\nAuntie Lofty: [laughs] See? Leave it to you three to come up with more ideas than I've had in a year! Now, that's talent.\n[cuckoo clock]\nAunt Holiday: Goodness. We'd better get going, or we'll miss our train home. I left you plenty of healthy food for the weekend.\nAuntie Lofty: And I left you cookies. [chuckles]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [gasp]\nAunt Holiday: The Cakes will stay with you tonight. Then Rarity, and Rainbow Dash after that. Remember, we're just a few stops from Ponyville if you need us.\nAuntie Lofty: She knows, Holiday. See you next week, slugger.\nScootaloo: Bye, Aunt Holiday! Bye, Auntie Lofty!\n[door closes]\nSweetie Belle: Your aunts are so nice.\nApple Bloom: Yeah. It's really cool they watch you while your parents are gone.\nScootaloo: I know. I just wish they lived closer.

[clears throat] Scootaloo? May I help you?\nScootaloo: I... just noticed your erasers needed dusting. [nervous laugh]\n[soft thuds]\nCheerilee and foals: [coughing]\nCheerilee: Why don't we hold off on the lesson until after lunch? How about show and tell? Does anypony have any\u2014?\nScootaloo: My parents are coming home to Ponyville today!\nSnips: Wait. They don't live here?\nScootaloo: Nope. Their jobs are way too important for that. They travel to the farthest, most dangerous places in Equestria to study unknown plants and fierce creatures. And what they learn helps pony science and medicine. I'd go with them, but it's too dangerous. Once, my mom had to wing-wrestle a wyvern, and my dad got trapped in a chimera's cave for three moons! He still has the scars to prove it.\nSnips: [scoffs] You're making that up. Nopony has that kind of job.\n[loud thuds]\n[cragadile roars]\nFoals: [gasp, scream]\nCheerilee: It's a cragadile!\n[cragadile growling]\n[crash!]\nSnap Shutter: Easy there, Marshmallow! Time you were in your crate for your nap! [grunting]\n[cragadile growling]\nMane Allgood: And that means now, mister!\n[cragadile whimpers]\n[clunk]\n[door closes]\nScootaloo: [gasps] Mom! Dad! [squeals]\nApple Bloom: Still think she's makin' it all up?\nSnips: Nuh-uh...\nScootaloo: Everypony, meet my parents \u2013 Snap Shutter and Mane Allgood!\nSnap Shutter: Heh. Sorry to make such an entrance. Just brought back a few mates from our last adventure.\nMane Allgood: We couldn't wait another moment to see Scootaloo! I hope we didn't interrupt anything.\n[hooves rattling]\nCheerilee: No, I, uh... think... class is dismissed.\n\n[students chattering]\nSnap Shutter: Crikey! You're nearly as tall as me now, Scoot!\nScootaloo: Aw, come on, Dad.\nMane Allgood: Oh, Scootaloo. We missed you.\nScootaloo: Me, too, Mom. Did you get all my letters?\nMane Allgood: And read them twenty times! But they're never as good as the real thing. It's so good to see you.\nSnap Shutter: I say we celebrate with ice cream sundaes. They don't have those in the jungle, that's for sure.\nMane Allgood: Why don't you all come? Our treat.\n\nScootaloo: And Princess Twilight said we're such good friendship tutors, she might even let us teach a class!\nSnap Shutter: Good on ya, Scoot!\nMane Allgood: What an honor!\nScootaloo: I can give you a tour of the school if you want. I mean, if you're staying for a while this time.\nSnap Shutter: Oh, you'll be seeing plenty of us.\nScootaloo: Really?!\nMane Allgood: Mm-hmm. Because we've taken a new job assignment that will let all of us live together!\nScootaloo: I can't believe it! That's awesome!\nApple Bloom: All right, Scootaloo!\nSweetie Belle: Woo-hoo!\nSnap Shutter: We never planned to be away for so long in the first place. We just kept discovering things that could help Equestria. And nopony else had the experience to finish our job.\nMane Allgood: But with all that's happened lately \u2013 Sombra's return, the destruction of the Tree of Harmony \u2013 we decided our family should be together.\nScootaloo: This is the best day of my life.\nSnap Shutter: We'll stay in town for the weekend so you can pack your things.\nScootaloo: Wait, what?!\nMane Allgood: We're all moving to Shire Lanka! That's where our new job is.\nScootaloo: But... my friends are in Ponyville.\nSnap Shutter: You can come back and visit 'em. Or they can take the train to us. There's one every month.\nApple Bloom: But Scootaloo can't leave!\nSweetie Belle: We've been together our whole lives!\nMane Allgood: It'll be a big change for everypony. But it'll be a good change. Give it time. You'll see.\nScootaloo: The only thing I see... is the end of the Cutie Mark Crusaders! [sniffling]\n\n[gavel pounding]\nApple Bloom: [sniffles] I now call our last ever Cutie Mark Crusader meeting to order. First item of business... [sobbing] CRY!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [crying]\n[pounding]\nScootaloo: You can't let the blank flanks down just 'cause I'm gone. You got to keep being CMCs without me.\nSweetie Belle: [sniffles] How?! There's only two of us!\nScootaloo: [sobbing] Maybe you can find a replacement for me.\nSweetie Belle: No, we can't! You're the only... you!\nApple Bloom: [sobbing] Nothin's gonna be the same! Who's gonna ride their scooter ahead of us everywhere we go?\nSweetie Belle: [sobbing] Or... Or put on plays with us? Or go camping with us? Or just hang out with us?!\nScootaloo: [sobbing] Well, it's worse for me! I have to say goodbye to both of\u2014!\n[door opens]\nRainbow Dash: Guess who just got three front-row tickets to the Wonderbolts show next week!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [whine, bawling]\nRainbow Dash: Uh, that is not the reaction I was expecting.\nScootaloo: [sniffles] Thanks for the tickets, Rainbow Dash. But I can't go.\nApple Bloom: Her parents are makin' her move super far away from Ponyville.\nRainbow Dash: What?! No way! Scootaloo belongs here!\nSweetie Belle: [sobbing] And now we'll probably never see her again! It's hopeless!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [crying]\nRainbow Dash: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I cannot believe you're giving up so easily. You're the Cutie Mark Crusaders. Solving tough problems is what you do.\nScootaloo: [sniffles] We are pretty good at coming up with ideas.\nSweetie Belle: That's right. When we work together, we're unstoppable!\nApple Bloom: I can't believe we didn't think of it before. It's list time, y'all! First question \u2013 why do Scootaloo's parents want to move to Shire Lanka?\nScootaloo: That's where their new job is.\nSweetie Belle: [gasps] What if we get them a job here instead?\nApple Bloom: Yeah! They like dangerous creatures, right? We got to have some of those around here. Like, uh, Timberwolves!\nScootaloo: Dad knows all about those. And cockatrices and bugbears. They only study super rare animals.\nSweetie Belle: Then maybe we need to give them an animal nopony's ever heard of!\nApple Bloom: Uh, then how would we hear about it?\nSweetie Belle: Because we're making it up! Come on!\nRainbow Dash: Sooooo... you want these tickets, or...?\n\n[leaves rustling]\nScootaloo: This is what I wanted to show you. The tracks of the mysterious Everfree banshee beast!\nMane Allgood: Hmmm... They're like nothing I've ever seen.\nScootaloo: Legend says it has five claws and three wings. And it's suuuuper dangerous if you get close. If only somepony could prove it exists.\nSnap Shutter: Hmmm... Easy enough. We'll follow the spoor.\nScootaloo: [panicked whimpering] I think I heard something this way.\n[leaves rustling]\n[camera clicks]\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: [grunting]\nApple Bloom: So the plan is we let 'em get a picture, then we hide again. Right?\nSweetie Belle: [straining]\n[twig snaps]\n[camera clicks]\nSweetie Belle: Now the plan is... run!\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: [panting]\n[snap!]\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: Aah! Oof!\nScootaloo: [nervous laugh] Guess you solved the mystery.\nMane Allgood: We'd better get back. There's a lot to get ready before the house goes up for sale tomorrow.\nScootaloo: [whines]\n\nSweetie Belle: Don't worry, Scootaloo. We have a new plan to keep you in Ponyville.\nApple Bloom: We just got to show your parents we're a set of three. Then they'll have to let you stay here with us.\n[camera clicks]\n\nSnap Shutter: Scoot, are these yours?\nScootaloo: Yeah. Thanks, Dad. We're sending them to the Pony Book of Records.\nSweetie Belle: We're the only three ponies in Equestria with the same cutie mark.\nApple Bloom: The chances of that are so rare. It means we belong together forever.\nSnap Shutter: Yeah, but you don't have the same cutie mark.\nApple Bloom: [short laugh] Sure we do. Look!\nSnap Shutter: Well, this part is the same. But the picture inside each of these is different. I think it means you'll stay best friends no matter where you go, and that's really special.\nScootaloo: But... we... [sighs] How do you argue with that?\n\nScootaloo: [sighs]\n[door opens]\nApple Bloom: All right, y'all. Time to take things up a notch.\nScootaloo: With prune juice?\nApple Bloom: It's a potion I mixed up from Zecora's book. Prune is only one of the ingredients.\nSweetie Belle: What's it do?\nApple Bloom: [reading] \"On this potion, please depend. Any separation, mend. Friends together 'til the end.\" We just got to dab a little on our hooves. Sounds perfect, right?\nScootaloo: Better than perfect!\n[drops splash]\nSweetie Belle: Is something supposed to happen?\n[magic sounds]\n[snap!]\nSweetie Belle: Is this the something that's supposed to happen?!\nApple Bloom: The book didn't really say.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Whoa... W-Whoa... Whoa! [grunt]\nScootaloo: Thanks for trying, Apple Bloom. But I might as well face it. I'm gonna have to leave Ponyville.\nApple Bloom: Don't give up, Scootaloo. This just gave me an even better idea how to keep you here. Come on!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Whoa! [grunt]\nSweetie Belle: Maybe we'd better see Zecora about fixing this first.\n\nScootaloo: We're running out of time.\n[chains jangling]\nScootaloo: This has to work!\n[door opens]\nMane Allgood: Scootaloo, I know you're having fun with your friends, but we need to get all our things to the station.\nSnap Shutter: We can't miss tomorrow's train. It's the only one for a month.\nScootaloo: Then you'll just have to go without me! I'm staying with the CMCs!\nSweetie Belle: We're chained to this post!\nApple Bloom: And nothin' and nopony is gonna move us! No matter... what.\nSnap Shutter: We just sold the house, Scoot. I know this is hard to accept, but just\u2014\nScootaloo: It's more than hard! It's not fair! You're making me pick between my family and my friends!\nMane Allgood: Oh, Scootaloo. Moving away won't stop you three from caring about each other. Why don't you sleep over with Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom tonight? It'll give you a chance to say a real goodbye.\nScootaloo: But I don't want to say goodbye! You're changing my whole life without even asking how I feel! [crying]\n\nApple Bloom: [panting] Scootaloo!\nSweetie Belle: Where are you going?\nScootaloo: To stay with my aunts. [tearing up] You heard my parents. There isn't another train to Shire Lanka for a month. If I'm not on it, they'll have to go without me.\nApple Bloom: Then we're comin' with ya!\nScootaloo: Are you sure? I don't want to get you in trouble.\nSweetie Belle: Rarity won't be mad.\nApple Bloom: Applejack neither. I bet she'd do the same thing for her friends.\nScootaloo: You're the best, you know that?\nApple Bloom: We're the best.\nSweetie Belle: Together!\n[train whistle blows]\n[brakes hiss]\n[train chugging]\n\n[knocking on door]\n[door opens]\nAunt Holiday: [gasps] Scootaloo! What a nice surprise.\nAuntie Lofty: And I've got a surprise for you! You three inspired me to finish my quilt. See? It's Cutie Mark Crusader-themed!\nAunt Holiday: We love hearing stories about all the ponies you've helped. So Lofty decided to celebrate the special job you three do.\nScootaloo: [sighs]\nAuntie Lofty: It's... still a work-in-progress.\nScootaloo: It's not your quilt we're sad about, Auntie Lofty. Mom and Dad are back. And they're making me move to Shire Lanka with them!\nAunt Holiday: Snap and Mane are back? They didn't tell me that.\nScootaloo: Oh. I think the mailpony delivered your letter to my house. I love my family, but I love being with my friends, too. I don't want to have to choose.\nAuntie Lofty: Well, then why don't your parents just stay in Ponyville?\nScootaloo: Their job is too important.\nApple Bloom: That's it!\nSweetie Belle: Is this another potion idea?\nApple Bloom: No. Scootaloo's parents are the only ponies in Equestria that can do what they do, right?\nScootaloo: Right...\nApple Bloom: Well, so are we! Our cutie marks prove it!\nSweetie Belle: Yeah... Our job is to help other ponies find their purpose!\nScootaloo: And nopony else can do that! So if my parents split us up, it'd be just as bad as them quitting their jobs!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Woo-hoo! [laughing]\nApple Bloom: Now, how do we explain that to 'em?\nAunt Holiday: Oh, you don't have to explain it.\nAuntie Lofty: They will.\n\nMane Allgood: Feeling better, Scootaloo?\nScootaloo: A little. I just want to show you something before we go.\nSnap Shutter: All right, but let's make it swift. That train won't wait.\n\nSnap Shutter: Sweet Celestia's slippers!\nMane Allgood: What is all this?\nRainbow Dash: It's Cutie Mark Crusader Appreciation Day! But we couldn't start without all of them here.\nPonies: CMCs! CMCs! CMCs! CMCs! CMCs! CMCs!\nMayor Mare: These three ponies share a rare ability to help others find their true purpose. It's a job only they can do, and only together.\nMane Allgood: That sounds familiar.\nMayor Mare: In honor of all they have done and continue to do for the ponies of this town, I would like to present the Cutie Mark Crusaders with a three-handled Key to the City!\nPonies: [cheering]\n[zooming]\nSnap Shutter: A full Wonderbolt salute!\nAunt Holiday: Oh, I'm not sure you know just how important Scootaloo and her friends are, little brother.\nAuntie Lofty: But you're about to find out.\nSkeedaddle: The CMCs used their free time to set up a camp to help us blank flanks find our cutie marks. The Cutie Mark Crusaders see the best in everypony, even when that pony can't see it in themselves.\nSnap Shutter: Well, I'll be a three-tailed bandicoot. I had no idea how important Scoot's club was.\nRainbow Dash: Oh, it's way more than just a club. The CMCs have made a difference for everypony here.\nTerramar: And not just ponies. They help everycreature.\nAunt Holiday: Whether it's encouraging others to discover their special talent...\n[hooves tapping]\nAuntie Lofty: ...or inspiring them to do what's in their heart...\nAunt Holiday: ...these three offer the town something no other pony can.\n[train whistle blows]\nRainbow Dash: No way! After all that, you're still gonna make her leave?!\nMane Allgood: We just want what's best for Scootaloo. And until now, we thought we knew what that was.\nSnap Shutter: [sighs] Turns out you're just like us, Scoot. You have an important job that only you can do. You love it, and it helps all of Equestria.\nMane Allgood: Sometimes that means missing out on other things you love, like watching our daughter grow into a pony we're very proud of.\nSnap Shutter: Which is a long way to say... Scoot, if you want to stay, we understand.\nScootaloo: [gasps] Really?! [tearing up] Thanks, Dad! Thanks, Mom!\nMane Allgood: Oh, sweetie, I'm just sorry we didn't realize it sooner.\nSnap Shutter: Our work is our life's purpose. We could never quit. So there's no way we can ask you to do the same.\nAuntie Lofty: Maybe you should've thought of that before you sold the house.\nAunt Holiday: Lofty, don't tease my brother. We already have a solution worked out.\nAuntie Lofty: Since the CMCs make Ponyville such a nice place, we've decided to move here.\nAunt Holiday: You can live with us, Scootaloo. If you'd like.\nScootaloo: That would be amazing! Will you... still come and visit?\nMane Allgood: Of course!\nSnap Shutter: Rabid bugbears couldn't keep us away.\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: You get to stay here! You get to stay here! You get to stay here! [laugh]\nApple Bloom: Uh... you are stayin' here, right?\nScootaloo: Are you kidding? CMCs forever!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [cheer]\nPonies: [cheering]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[stomping]\nTwilight Sparkle: Remind me how this happened again!\n[crunch]\nApplejack: And why there's a giant turtle eatin' my family's entire summer crop!\nFluttershy: Oh, dear.

Maybe they don't think we're up to the responsibility of protecting Equestria after all!\nSpike: Or maybe this week's just a one-time thing that'll never happen again.\n[doors open]\nPrincess Celestia: Ah!

Real life is happening out here.\nTwilight Sparkle: Wait. That's what this is about? You're sick of being princesses?\nPrincess Celestia: Not exactly. Battling the Everfree Forest alongside Star Swirl made us realize what we've missed out on. So, instead of spending the day ruling...\nPrincess Luna: ...and the night patrolling dreams...\nPrincess Celestia: ...we wanted a chance to do the things you do. Save the day! Adventure with friends! Shampoo anteaters.\nSpike: I'm pretty sure Fluttershy's the only pony that does that.\nRainbow Dash: Well, there are waaaay more fun things to do than follow us around.\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! You should make a list of all the stuff you never tried but always wanted to! There's a lotta little things out there to do!\nPrincess Celestia: What an intriguing idea. Only... it's much harder to justify a vacation from the castle when it's not an emergency we're responding to.\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't worry. We'll cover your palace duties. It'll be a good chance for us to practice for when you retire.\nPrincess Luna: Well, if you're sure you don't mind the extra effort.\nTwilight Sparkle: [scoffs]\nPrincess Celestia: Thank you, Twilight!

We round them up, parade them through the streets, and finish with a party in the castle.\n[swan squawks]\nRainbow Dash: One question. Why?!\nTwilight Sparkle: It doesn't matter. This is our chance to show Celestia and Luna we'll do whatever the job requires. If they can take care of all this themselves, then I know we can. Together.\nFluttershy: Um... hmm.\nRarity: Ah. Jolly good.\nSpike: You're definitely not reading the same scroll I am.\n\nPrincess Celestia: Remember, sister.

Oh.\nApplejack: Uh, we're fillin' in for Their Majesties. What can we help y'all with?\nFancy Pants: I say. How irregular. Well then. We offer our assistance as heads of the Royal Swanifying Committee.\nRarity: Ah, what a relief.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you, but we have it all covered.\nFancy Pants: Reeeeeally? Well, good luck with that.\nTwilight Sparkle: If we ask for help, it's just like admitting we're not as good at the job as Luna and Celestia are. Besides, how hard can throwing a swan party be?\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! All we have left to do is polish the armor, bubble the punch, glitter the carpet, puff the pastry, float the floats, and carpet every road in Canterlot! Should I keep reading?\nTwilight Sparkle: [nervous laugh]\n\nSometimes you can be a pill\nAnd why's the way ahead always so steep?\n\nPrincess Luna: Uh, Celestia? Since we're both a little tired, m-maybe the first thing we do shouldn't be too wild.\nPrincess Celestia: Exactly what I was thinking.\n\nPrincess Celestia: ziiiiip liiiiiiiiiine!\n\nPrincess Celestia: Now, every time we have tea, we can remember this magical day!\nPrincess Luna: Well, I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. But now, we're going to do something I've always wanted to do but never could because of my night shift.\nPrincess Celestia: Is it another zip line?\nPrincess Luna: No.\n\nPrincess Luna: It's the post office!\nPrincess Celestia: It is indeed.\nPrincess Luna: Just think! All the mail in Ponyville goes through here! Isn't that amazing?!\n[thump]\nPrincess Luna: One stamp, please!\n[clattering]\nPrincess Luna: [licks] Wait for it...\n[watch ticking]\n[door opens]\nPrincess Celestia: You didn't need a stamp if you were just going to give this to me.\nPrincess Luna: Yes, but I didn't give it to you.

Tell him.\n[swan squawks]\nFancy Pants: And you must do something about the garbage piling up outside. The street sweepers are on strike, and the royal carpeters can't do their jobs.\nApplejack: Did you even know there were royal street carpeters?\nFancy Pants: Oh, dear. I do hope those aren't the final decorations for the gala.\nRarity: How rude.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you for your constructive criticism.

[groans]\nPrincess Celestia: Well, they hurt less than that horrible howling you dragged us to.\nPrincess Luna: That was Ponygliacci, and it's an opera! And you made us leave early, even though it was still my turn.\nPrincess Celestia: Oh, just face it, Luna. You are never happy!\nPrincess Luna: Because you don't want me to be happy. I always have to do things your way. I bet you wish I'd never come back so you could still rule day and night!\nPrincess Celestia: You think I like that kind of pressure?!

And don't you dare use your Canterlot Voice on me! I think this adventure would be better if I did it by myself!\nPrincess Celestia: Fine! I just remembered something I forgot I always wanted to do. Be alone!\nPrincess Luna: [tearing up] Guess we have the same thing on both of our lists then.\n\nApplejack: Pinkie! You got those appetizers yet?!\nPinkie Pie: Still mashing the guacamole!\nSpike: [yelping]\nRarity: So we're just going to have to do with sequins!\nFluttershy: Um, sorry for the bad news, but the courtyard is full of swans waiting to get in!\n[swans squawking]\nRainbow Dash: And we're nowhere near ready!\nTwilight Sparkle: How does Celestia and Luna rule a kingdom and get all this done by themselves every year?!\nFancy Pants: [laughs] Oh, how droll.\nSpike: Uh, what's the funny part exactly?\nFancy Pants: The princesses never do all the ceremony planning by themselves.\nTwilight Sparkle: They don't?\nFancy Pants: Oh, goodness, no. That's what the gala planning committees are for. Nopony could handle all this. [sips] Are those... sequins?\nRarity: Still rude.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ooh! New plan, everypony! We're going to delegate!\n\nRainbow Dash: [to Upper Crust] You! You're on food duty!\nRarity: [to Jet Set] I need gemstones! And purple satin!\nFluttershy: [to Fleur de Lis] Tell the ponies at the gates there's a slight delay on the gala! Oh, um, if it's not too much trouble, I mean.\nApplejack: Uh... Now, who can we get to clean up all this garbage?\n[stomping]\nPinkie Pie: I'm delegating!\nTwilight Sparkle: So this is how you rule Equestria!\n\nPrincess Luna: [slurping, sighs] Things are so much more relaxing without my bossy sister.\n[ponies laughing]\n\nPrincess Celestia: Who needs a gloomy sister moping around all the time anyway?

I'm, uh, here for the moonset.\n[beat]\nPrincess Celestia: So, uh, how did the rest of your day go?\nPrincess Luna: Oh, amazing! Yeah. Uh, f-fantastic. Best ever, really.\nPrincess Celestia: Yeah. Me... too. Mmm.\nPrincess Luna: You... You can walk with me. You know, i-if you want, I mean.\nPrincess Celestia: Oh, well... [scoffs] Since we're going the same way. [laughs]\n\nPrincess Luna: This is so beautiful. It must be amazing in the sunlight.\nPrincess Celestia: The night's pretty special, too.\nPrincess Celestia and Princess Luna: Lucky star!\nPrincess Luna: You taught me to look for those when I was a filly.\nPrincess Celestia: [laughs] Hope I wasn't too bossy doing it.\nPrincess Luna: You know, being with your sister all the time is hard, but being without her? It's even harder.\nPrincess Celestia: I do know. [sighs] And I wouldn't trade you for any of the adventures on my list.\nPrincess Luna: Not even your zip line?\n[poof!]\nPrincess Celestia: Not even my zip line.\nPrincess Luna: I'm sorry I said those things before. Sometimes it's just tough being the little sister.\nPrincess Celestia: It's not always easy being the big sister either. I'm sorry, too.\nPrincess Luna: [gasps] The sun and the moon together? At the same time?\nPrincess Celestia: Now, where have I seen that before?\nPrincess Celestia and Princess Luna: [laugh]\n[long pause]\nPrincess Celestia: You think maybe Twilight's having trouble with the amulet?\nPrincess Luna: We should probably go help her.\n\nSpike: Okay, okay!

What is taking her so long? [giggles] Just kidding. You guys really need to look behind you once in a while.\nTwilight Sparkle: Uh, Pinkie? You said you had something important to tell us.\nPinkie Pie: Not telling so much as showing. In fact, what you're about to see may shake the very foundations of your perception for all time!\nFluttershy: Um... a cupcake?\nPinkie Pie: Yes! But wait, there's more!\n[click]\n[squeak!]\nPinkie Pie: It's an invitation to visit the Cheese Sandwich Amusement Factory!\nSpike: Cheese Sandwich opened a factory?\nApplejack: Heh. What do they make there? Rubber chickens?\nPinkie Pie: That's ridiculous! They make way more there than just rubber chickens! [giggles]\nRarity: Gosh, Cheese hardly seems the factory type. I just assumed he'd continue to wander Equestria throwing parties. Still, you must be excited to see him.\nPinkie Pie: I am! I can't wait to tour his factory, catch up, have him tell me my life's purpose, swap gag tips\u2014\nApplejack: Whoa-whoa-whoa. What did you say?\nPinkie Pie: Uh, catch up? I mean, it has been a while.\nTwilight Sparkle: I think Applejack's asking about the part about Cheese Sandwich and your life's purpose.\nPinkie Pie: Oh, that. Yeah. It's just... All of you have found your thing. You're gonna rule all of Equestria, Rainbow Dash is a Wonderbolt, Fluttershy has her animal sanctuary, Rarity has her boutiques, Applejack has the hat... And the farm! So that's like... two things! I don't even have one. [sighs, chomps] When I first got Cheese's invite, I was a little jealous. It felt like even he was moving on to bigger and better things. And everypony was leaving me behind. But then I realized Cheese Sandwich is a party pony just like me. If he figured out his purpose, he can help me figure out mine.\nTwilight Sparkle: I think talking to Cheese Sandwich is a great idea. But the only pony who can really find your life's purpose is you.\nPinkie Pie: I know, silly. That's why I'm going to visit Cheese Sandwich's factory so I can ask him to help me. [chomps]\nSpike: Uh, Pinkie? Are you sure this is edible?\nPinkie Pie: I am not! [chomps]\n\n[theme song]\n\n[bouncing]\nPinkie Pie: Yup! Anypony with a smile like that is exactly the kind of pony I want helping me!\n[bouncing]\nPinkie Pie: Oh, hey, guys! Pardon me? Just gonna... squeeze by? [straining]\nGuard Pony 1: Can we help you?\nPinkie Pie: You sure can! I'm here to see Cheese Sandwich!\nGuard Pony 2: Cheese Sandwich doesn't \"see\" anypony.\nGuard Pony 1: This factory's shut tight. Nopony ever comes out, and nopony ever goes in. Including you. So move along.\nPinkie Pie: Aw, that's a shame. To think I came all this way because of this personal invitation from Cheese Sandwich himself.\nGuard Pony 2: You... You have an invitation?\nGuard Pony 1: Well, why didn't you say so?\n[alarm]\n[clang!]\nGuard Pony 2: Next time, I get to push the button.\nPinkie Pie: Ooh! Desolate-y! Hello? Anypony there?\n[doors open]\nPinkie Pie: [yelps] Cheese! I'm so happy to see you! [strains]\n[stretch]\n[whip!]\nSans Smirk: Hmm. This should have gotten a big laugh. I wonder if we need to add more carpet rolls. I suppose it could be the mask. Let's try taking the nostril flare down ten percent. Thoughts?\nPinkie Pie: I have a thought. Who are you?\nSans Smirk: So sorry. Sans Smirk, vice-president of amusement integration. Mr. Sandwich is very excited you're here. If you'll just follow me, it's a short trip through the factory to Cheese's office.\nPinkie Pie: Wow! A whole factory dedicated to gags! Ooh! I bet this is the funnest place ever!\n[doors open]\nPinkie Pie: Huh.\n[industrial sounds]\n[conveyor belt whirring]\nPinkie Pie: Maybe the fun is behind all this boring-looking factory stuff.\n[thud]\n[pop!]\n[thunk!]\nSans Smirk: The fun is the factory stuff. We take a fairly serious approach to comedy here. Observe. [stilted] Oh, look. A pretty flower. [sniffs]\n[squirt]\nPinkie Pie: The squirting flower's a classic. Ohhh! What if the flower was part of a shirt, but the flower didn't squirt \u2013 the shirt did?!\nSans Smirk: That is literally the funniest thing I've ever heard.\nPinkie Pie: Oh, [giggles] come on. That's just off the top of my head. You probably get, like, seventeen thousand ideas like that from Cheese every minute.\nSans Smirk: We'd have to use a series of interconnected tubes in the fabric. What do you think of this?\n[flatulence]\nPinkie Pie: I think it's a whoopee cushion.\nSans Smirk: Yes...?\nPinkie Pie: But what if you made the embarrassing sound come from somepony else?!\nSans Smirk: I sit on it, but the sound comes from you... We could call it the \"ventriloquoopee cushion\".\n[factory ponies agreeing]\nPinkie Pie: So... which way is Cheese's office again?\nSans Smirk: Right. Of course. It's been quite a while since we've had the opportunity to work with true comic inspiration like this.\nPinkie Pie: What about Cheese?\nSans Smirk: Oh! One more thing. Our super-slip banana peel. Still in development, but we think it's pretty special.\n[splattering sounds]\n[factory ponies yelping]\nSans Smirk: So? Too slippery?\nPinkie Pie: Ohhh-ho-ho. What if, instead of slipping, you were sticking? One step on this banana peel, and you can't get it off! [giggles] That's funny!\nSans Smirk: Wow. Just... wow. You're exactly the pony Cheese Sandwich needs to see.\nPinkie Pie: Great! Because he's exactly the pony I need to see!\n[door opens]\nPinkie Pie: Uh... hello?\nCheese Sandwich: [grimly] Pinkie, I'm... I'm glad you came.\nPinkie Pie: Of course I did. Your factory's... big. It really seems like you found your purpose. Which is perfect, since I came here for help.\nCheese Sandwich: That is perfect. I knew I could count on you to help me.\nPinkie Pie: Well, that's triple-perfect, because... uh, wait. Why do you need my help?\nCheese Sandwich: Because, Pinkie, I... [claps]\n[ka-chunk]\nCheese Sandwich: ...I completely lost my laugh!\nPinkie Pie: [gasps]\n\nPinkie Pie: You lost your laugh? Is that some kind of joke? Because it's not a funny one.\nCheese Sandwich: It's not a joke. And even if it was, I... I wouldn't be able to laugh at it.\nPinkie Pie: Riiiiight... Why don't we continue this discussion over some delicious canned peanut brittle, hmm? [laughs]\n[sproing]\nPinkie Pie: Wow. You did lose your laugh. That's horrible!\nSans Smirk: Sorry to interrupt, but it occurs to me that a seven percent tighter wind on the snake springs would yield a twelve percent increase in giggle output.\nCheese Sandwich: This is why we're a team. Sans here has always been able to eke every last laugh out of my gags. W-Which is a help, since I haven't come up with any good ones in a while.\nPinkie Pie: Wait. So you can tell if a gag is funny is not \u2013 you just can't laugh at it?\nCheese Sandwich: [tearing up] Yes! And it's torture!\nPinkie Pie: How did this happen?\nCheese Sandwich: I don't know. Back when I was a party pony, I... I laughed at everything.\n\nCheese Sandwich: [voiceover] I spread my party cheer wherever it was needed. I even started making individual, one-of-a-kind novelty gags for each and every one of my parties.\n[whack! whack! whack!]\n[foals laughing]\nCheese Sandwich: [laughing]\nCheese Sandwich: [voiceover] Soon, it seemed like everypony in Equestria wanted one.\n[excited sounds]\n\n[buzzing]\nCheese Sandwich: [laughs]\nCheese Sandwich: [voiceover] It was more work than my hooves could handle, but I didn't want to disappoint all those smiling faces.\n[door opens]\nCheese Sandwich: [voiceover] Luckily, Sans Smirk came to me with the idea for a factory. A gag factory. I could finally keep up with demand and make everypony happy. Soon we were sending gags all over Equestria.\n[conveyor belt whirs]\n[flatulence]\n[conveyor belt whirs]\n[crank]\n[ribbit!]\n[conveyor belt whirs]\n[squirt]\nCheese Sandwich: [voiceover] But then, one day, my laugh was just... gone.\n\nCheese Sandwich: I haven't left the factory since. I-I don't want anypony to see me like this. I-I mean, look at me! Boneless 2 doesn't even recognize me anymore!\n[chair creaks]\nCheese Sandwich: So, can you help me, Pinkie? W-What do you think?\nPinkie Pie: I think I've got two words for you. Knock... knock.\nCheese Sandwich: Who's there?\nPinkie Pie: Boo.\nCheese Sandwich: Boo who?\nPinkie Pie: Don't cry, because I'm gonna get you your laugh back!\n\nPinkie Pie: Let's start with something small. Excuse me, Mr. Smirk. But is there something in my... eye?!\n[rattling]\nSans Smirk: Top notch eye-googling, Ms. Pie.\nCheese Sandwich: [groans]\nPinkie Pie: Why, thanks, Sans, ol' pal. Put her there!\n[buzzing]\nSans Smirk: [groaning]\n[sizzle]\nPinkie Pie: Oh. Sorry about that. Let me make it up to you. How about some... pie?\n[splat!]\nSans Smirk: Googly eye to hoof buzzer to pie-face pratfall. Mwah! Masterful.\nCheese Sandwich: Meh.\nPinkie Pie: Come on! Those classic bits put Rainbow Dash's funny bone in a cast for a week!\nCheese Sandwich: Don't blame yourself, Pinkie. Whatever I got, I got it bad.\nPinkie Pie: Hmmm... Maybe we need to start even smaller.\n\nPinkie Pie: You can't run before you can walk, and you can't laugh before you can smile. And your smiler's all out of whack. Now let's see what we're working with. Give me your biggest, bestest smile!\nCheese Sandwich: [straining] Am I doing it? Am I smiling? I feel like I'm smiling.\nPinkie Pie: Almost... [laughing nervously] Maybe I just need to spot you for a rep or two. [straining] Okay! You got this! It's all you! Ready?\nCheese Sandwich: Anything?\nPinkie Pie: Awww...\nCheese Sandwich: Guh.\nPinkie Pie: I'm not giving up on you yet, Cheese. I know there's something somewhere that'll make you laugh. I just have to figure out where to look.\nSans Smirk: I would like to take this opportunity to point out that we are in a gag factory.\n\n[door opens]\nSans Smirk: This is where the magic happens \u2013 research and development. It's where we figure out the science of funny.\nPinkie Pie: How do you science funny?\nSans Smirk: Of course there's no one-size-fits-all joke. No grand unified gag theory. But if we figure out the funny of one gag, we can combine it with the funny of another gag and make a third funnier gag.\n[sproing]\n[splat]\nPinkie Pie: I... guess that makes sense. \"Rule of threes\". Hmmm. One, two, three. Yup. That math checks out. Hmmm. At this point, I'm willing to give anything a try.\n\n[montage music]\n[awestruck sounds]\n[door closes]\n[clang!]\n[splash!]\n[\"uh-uh\", \"nope\", etc.]\n\n[squirt]\n[pop-pop-pop]\n\nPinkie Pie: [groans] I don't understand! We've tried everything! Stand-up, classic gag, physical humor, prop comedy, vaudeville, surrealist alt-scene character pieces \u2013 nothing's worked!\nSans Smirk: It seems we've exhausted every avenue that even the science of comedy can provide.\nCheese Sandwich: That's it then.\nPinkie Pie: What do you mean?\nCheese Sandwich: [sighs] I appreciate everything you've done, Pinkie, but if you can't make me laugh, nopony can.\nSans Smirk: But, sir, you can't just surrender.\nCheese Sandwich: It doesn't look like I have a choice. I need to figure out how to live without a laugh. I know you tried your best, but it's time you went home.\n[doors open]\nPinkie Pie: [gasps]\nSans Smirk: I, too, am horrified.\n\nPinkie Pie: So that's it? You're all just giving up?\nSans Smirk: I'm afraid Mr. Sandwich is right. You are the funniest pony in Equestria. And if you can't bring back his laugh, it is surely gone forever.\nPinkie Pie: But... Cheese was just as funny as me. I-I can't believe that's all gone.\n[doors open]\nSans Smirk: None of us can. I shudder to think what'll become of the factory.\nPinkie Pie: You're not gonna close down, are you? I thought this place was Cheese's life's purpose!\nSans Smirk: It certainly was mine. But if Mr. Sandwich has finally given up, there's only so long we can retool his old ideas before we run out of gags to produce. I don't suppose... you'd consider working here? Your fresh take on our classic gags rivals Mr. Sandwich in his prime.\nPinkie Pie: I need to find my life's purpose, but I don't think that's it. I'm a party pony! I need to make ponies happy in real-time!\nSans Smirk: Ah, yes. In our early days, nothing brought Mr. Sandwich more pleasure than seeing the laughter his gags brought to ponies firsthoof.\nPinkie Pie: Guess it's back to the drawing board.\nSans Smirk: Well, there will always be a place for you here if you change your mind.\nPinkie Pie: Hold on. What did you just say?\nSans Smirk: There'll always be a place for you here?\nPinkie Pie: No-no-no-no. Before that.\nSans Smirk: Back to the drawing board.\nPinkie Pie: [groans] That was me!\nSans Smirk: Nothing brought Mr. Sandwich more pleasure than seeing the laughter his gags brought to ponies firsthoof?\nPinkie Pie: Yes! That! We've been going about this all wrong! We don't need to make Cheese laugh. He needs to make us laugh!\n[zip!]\n\n[door opens]\nPinkie Pie: Cheese! I figured it out! I know why you can't laugh!\nCheese Sandwich: What? Why?\nPinkie Pie: You started this factory because you didn't want to disappoint smiling faces. But in here, you can't see any.\nSans Smirk: [panting] It does make a certain sense, sir. Spreading laughter has always brought you joy.\nCheese Sandwich: But spreading laughter is what this factory does.\nPinkie Pie: Except you don't see it. You're a party pony like me. You need to make ponies smile in-person! Here. Just try it.\nCheese Sandwich: Okay... um... [clears throat] Why did Boneless 2 cross the road? To prove to Boneless 1 he wasn't a chicken.\nSans Smirk: Very funny, sir. Excellent joke. Oh! I mean... [forced laughter]\nPinkie Pie: Really?\nSans Smirk: Sorry.

I-I don't understand.\nCheese Sandwich: Pinkie was right. This is what I need.\n[factory ponies laughing]\nCheese Sandwich: I just can't have funny ideas. I need to wander the land and see ponies laughing at them. You can run the factory, but I need to [operatically] liiiiiive! And don't think I've forgotten about you, little buddy.\n[chair creaks]\nCheese Sandwich: I knew you'd be onboard. Don't worry. Out in Equestria, I'll have more great ideas for gags, and I'll send them all to you.\nSans Smirk: Sir, are you sure this is what you want to do?\nCheese Sandwich: Of course. It's my life's purpose!\nPinkie Pie: Hey! That's what I came here looking for!\nCheese Sandwich: You did? Well, come on!

But I think Sans Smirk's hooves were the perfect ones to leave it in. As much as Cheese was born to wander Equestria and make ponies laugh in-person, Sans was born to run that factory.\nApplejack: And you don't sound so worried about findin' your life's purpose anymore.\nPinkie Pie: Nope! I figured out Cheese and I are pretty much the same. We both need to see ponies laughing to feel fulfilled. And I already do that. My life is purposing itself all over the place!\nRarity: [giggles] I agree completely.\nPinkie Pie: Thanks. Oh! I almost forgot! I got you all a little something from my trip.

But I was even more surprised that she wanted the first game to be between her school and ours! Apparently, she's a huge sports fan.\nPinkie Pie: Always thought Celestia was kind of a jock, just with really wavy hair.\nTwilight Sparkle: Anyway, we don't have much time. The game is in two weeks, and I want all of you to coach the team!\n[excited chattering]\nFluttershy: [hyperventilating]\nTwilight Sparkle: I know how you feel. Young athletes ready to take the field. Ooh, you could almost breathe in the excitement!\nFluttershy: [gasps]\nSnails: I don't think you should breathe it in so hard.\n[splash!]\nFluttershy: It's just... Two weeks doesn't feel like a whole lot of time to train a whole team.\nPinkie Pie: Mmmmaybe the School of Magic could play a few other schools first. Like the Mane and Tail Styling College or the Scroll-Making Institute?\nTwilight Sparkle: Relax. You're gonna do just fine.\nFluttershy: Um, [gasps] what makes you so sure?\nTwilight Sparkle: Because I have faith in my friends, who also happen to be the best buckball players in Equestria!\nPinkie Pie: Oh, yeah!\n[squeaks]\n[music]\n[smack!]\n[whoosh!]\nFluttershy: I guess that is sort of true.\nTwilight Sparkle: I asked Rainbow Dash to help, too. But I'm not sure when she\u2014\n[whooshes]\nRainbow Dash: Sorry I'm late! But when Twilight said she needed my help with the buckball team, I figured I'd better grab every piece of coaching equipment I could find! So what should I focus on? Offense? Defense? Trick plays?\nTwilight Sparkle: I was thinking of something even more important.\nRainbow Dash: Awesome! Lay it on me. Whatever it is, I'll give it a hundred and twenty percent!\nTwilight Sparkle: I knew I could count on your enthusiasm! That's why I want you to coach the cheer squad!\n[thud]\nRainbow Dash: Cheerleading?!\n\n[theme song]\n\n[music]\nRainbow Dash: I don't mean to sound ungrateful. It's just when you said you wanted my help with something important, I thought you meant something important.\nTwilight Sparkle: The cheer squad is important.\nRainbow Dash: [laughs hysterically] Oh. Well, sure, cheer squad is totally important to somepony who isn't me. But I'm more about ponies playing in the game, not cheering for it.\n[students laughing]\nRainbow Dash: I mean, it's great that some ponies only want to cheer, though I don't know why they would.\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmmm. Well, maybe this will be a good opportunity for you to find out.\nRainbow Dash: Of course I've seen cheer squads before \u2013 on the sidelines \u2013 but I'm not even a hundred percent sure what they do. I'll probably just mess it up.\nTwilight Sparkle: I think you might be surprised. In fact, I'm more sure than ever that you're the perfect choice.\nSnips: I'm actually one hundred and twenty percent sure. And it's a good thing, too. The cheer squad really needs you.\nRainbow Dash: What do you mean?\nSnips: Well, I've been helping out, and let's put it this way. We've got two weeks until the big game, and... we could use two years. But that's all gonna change because you're here to save the day!\nRainbow Dash: Okay... So why are you here?\nSnips: What? A pony can't show school spirit?\nRainbow Dash: You don't even go to this school.\nSnips: Uh, okay. When I went to the Buckball Hall of Fame, I found out buckball souvenirs are big bits. If Twilight's team does well, I could start selling them full-time in Ponyville! So I have a vested interest, and you have an assistant coach! [blows whistle]\nRainbow Dash: Ugh.\n\nLighthoof and Shimmy Shake: [giggling]\nLighthoof: [valley girl accent] She's here!\nShimmy Shake: [valley girl accent] Get the lights!\n[rhythmically] Over and over and over again!\n[Lighthoof]\n[rhythmically] We wanna dance for each other and for all of our friends!\nRainbow Dash: Dancing. Right. I've seen you two around school, haven't I?\nShimmy Shake: [laughs] I'm Shimmy Shake, and this is Lighthoof.\nLighthoof: And we are your lead dancers.\n[beat]\nRainbow Dash: I didn't know you three would be here.\nYona: [laughs] Yona want to cheer and make pony pyramid!\n[stomping]\nOcellus: And I thought this could be my chance to make an impression on everypony. You know, for something other than changing shape.\nRainbow Dash: I didn't realize you were into school spirit, Smolder.\nSmolder: Eh. I just came with these two. Guess they think you can make cheer squad cool or something.\nRainbow Dash: Don't count on it.\nSnips: Okay! Now that we're all here, why don't you tell us the plan? How are you gonna make us into the most awesome cheer squad ever?\nRainbow Dash: Eh... I'unno.\nCheer Squad: [groan]\nRainbow Dash: I mean, if you guys were an actual buckball team, I'd have plenty of ideas. But I don't know anything about cheerleading.\nSnips: Oh! [laughs] Yes! Good one, coach! But Headmare Twilight picked you for the job, so I'm pretty sure you know what you're doing.\nRainbow Dash: If you say so.\nSnips: [laughs] Right. Okay, gang, let's show Rainbow Dash what we've been working on, and she can take it from there.\nYona: Cheer squad can do that!\n[stomping]\nLighthoof: Yup. All we need is a little music!\n[up-tempo music playing]\nShimmy Shake: Over... and over... and over a...gain!\n[stomping]\nLighthoof: We want to dance... for each other and for all of our friends!\nSmolder: [unenthusiastically] Two, four, six, eight.\nOcellus: [quietly] Uh... friendship school is really... great.\n[stomping]\n[crash!]\nSmolder: Well, that was a disaster.\nShimmy Shake: It's kind of hard to stick to our choreography when the floor is moving.\nLighthoof: [scoffs] Yeah, Yona, your stomps are a little too powerful.\nYona: Can we make pony pyramid instead?\nOcellus: Maybe we should figure out what cheers we should do first.\nSmolder: [scoffs, sarcastically] Yeah, because that'll fix everything.\nSnips: So, I mean, there's a few... uh, a lot of problems, but nothing you can't solve, right?\nRainbow Dash: Huh? Oh, yeah. Listen, you guys don't have anything to worry about.\nSmolder: We don't?\nRainbow Dash: Nope. In fact, I think what you all just did is totally fine. You guys have got this. So, uh, I'm just gonna head down to the field. Uh, great practice, everypony!\n[whoosh]\n[door slams]\n\n[rhythmically] Over and over and over again!\n\n[rhythmically] We wanna dance for each other and for all of our friends!\n\nRainbow Dash: Ugh! What are you doing?\nSnips: [grunting] What are you doing?! You've got to come back and coach the squad!\nRainbow Dash: I watched them cheer stuff. Looked fine to me.\nSnips: [grunts] Well, it's not! Do you know what'll happen if they do what they just did at the big game?\nRainbow Dash: Uh, nothing?\nSnips: Uh, wrong!\nRainbow Dash: Ooh!\nSnips: A good cheer squad gets the fans excited, which gets the team excited. But if nopony's excited, then no... pony... buys... any... souvenirs!\nRainbow Dash: I think you're blowing this a little out of proportion.\nSnips: Point is, if I'm going to make any bits at these games, that squad has to get better. And to do that, they need a coach.\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] You know what? You're right! Why don't you do it? I mean, you're the one with a vested interest.\n\nSnails: The trick to being a good buckball keeper is to do nothin'. Just empty your mind. Be the ball.\nPizzelle: Uh, balls don't have minds.\nSnails: Exactly.\n[music]\n\"November Rain\": Uh, where's my blindfold?\n\"Berry Bliss\": My turn!\nPizzelle: I want to do that!\n\"Berry Bliss\": Over here!\nSmolder: Why are you watching Snails' weird practice when you're supposed to be practicing with us?\nRainbow Dash: [chuckles] Snails' practice is definitely weird. Uh, I thought Snips was practicing with you.\nSmolder: He was.\nShimmy Shake: [sighs] Do you have any idea how hard it is to dance in this stuff?\nOcellus: [softly] Plus all these buttons jingle so much, you can't hear my cheers.\nSmolder: Speaking up might help a little.\nRainbow Dash: So don't dance and cheer.\nYona: Uh, then what cheer squad do?\nRainbow Dash: I dunno.\nSmolder: [angrily] Maybe you should! [calmly] Or whatever. You're the coach! You're supposed to come up with stuff for us to do.\nRainbow Dash: Okay. I've got something for you to do.\n\nSnails: Just do nothing. Empty your minds. Be the squad.\nSmolder: We are the squad.\nSnails: Oh, yeah.\nSnips: At least helping sell my souvenirs was... something.\nYona: Yona still not understand how this make us better. Huh? Professor Dash needs to stay and coach!\nRainbow Dash: [groans] You guys asked me to come up with something, and I did.\nSmolder: I don't think nothing counts.\nRainbow Dash: Then I'm out of ideas.\nSnails: This is the School of Friendship. If you need ideas, you should ask your friends for help.\nRainbow Dash: Ugh, fine.\n\n[montage music]\n[party cannon squeak]\n\nRainbow Dash: Okay. Since you guys have been nagging me nonstop about this cheer stuff for, like, ever...\nSmolder: It has literally been one day.\nRainbow Dash: ...I went around and got everything you need!\n[music]\nSmolder: Uh, what're we supposed to do with hay?\nRainbow Dash: Beats me, but Applejack seemed pretty sure about it. Oh, I almost forgot.\nOcellus: A rhyming dictionary?\nRainbow Dash: Yeah. Zecora's a lot less helpful than you'd think. That's from the library so you can come up with cheers. Okay! Good practice!\nSmolder: So, you're just leaving again?\nRainbow Dash: Ugh! Look. I talked to my friends, and they said this is the stuff you need. Wouldn't a true cheer squad be able to figure out what to do with it?\nLighthoof: But Fluttershy and Pinkie wanted us to show 'em everything we come up with tomorrow!\nShimmy Shake: They want us to get the team all excited before the big game!\nRainbow Dash: Well, then it's a good thing I got you all this stuff. You better get to work!\n[whoosh]\n[door slams]\nSnips: Don't look at me.\n\n[music]\nFluttershy: Good work, everypony! Let's take a break!\nRainbow Dash: [whistles] Yeah! [whistles] Wow! This team is really shaping up! Nice job!\nFluttershy: Thanks. I'm excited to see what you've been up to.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah! I can't wait to see the cheer squad!\nRainbow Dash: [laughs hysterically] Oh. You're serious.\nPinkie Pie: Woo-hoo! Go, team! This is so exciting!\nFluttershy: Well, I'm sure you've put in a lot of hard work.\nRainbow Dash: How much work does cheer squad need?\nSnips: Anypony want to buy an official School of Friendship cheer squad headband? Now I personally would buy them before the performance!\nPinkie Pie and Fluttershy: Huh?\n[up-tempo music playing]\n[stomping]\n[Shimmy Shake]\nOver... and over... and over again!\n[stomping continues]\n[Lighthoof]\nWe wanna dance for each other and for all of our friends!\n[Smolder]\n[unenthusiastically] School of Friendship, rah, rah, rah\n[Ocellus]\nLet's win this game and hit the... oh, what rhymes with \"rah\"?

What?\n\nOver... and over... and over again!\n\nWe wanna dance for each other and for all of our friends!\n\n[unenthusiastically] School of Friendship, rah, rah, rah\n\nLet's win this game and hit the... oh, what rhymes with \"rah\"? Spa?\n\nRainbow Dash: I don't know what everypony's so upset about. So it wasn't great. Cheerleading's never great. That's why everypony gets up to get a snack during it.\nYona: [bawls loudly]\nRainbow Dash: What is the big deal?\nShimmy Shake: If you don't know, there's no point in us trying to explain it to you!\nLighthoof: Lead dancers, out!\nShimmy Shake and Lighthoof: Hmph!\nSmolder: It's not that we were bad. It's that you didn't even want to try to help us get better!\nRainbow Dash: I didn't try? What are you talking about?! I got you a party cannon! It's not my fault you couldn't figure out how to use it right.\nOcellus: [loudly] Well, you could have shown us! [sobbing]\nRainbow Dash: Whoa. Ponies might actually care about cheer squad if she cheered like that all the time.\nSmolder: Why would you say ponies don't care about cheer squad?\nRainbow Dash: Because they don't.\nSmolder: No. You don't. But they do! I bet Headmare Twilight does! And you know what? I do, too! I actually got excited when I found out you were gonna be our coach! I figured if anypony can make cheer squad awesome, it's you!\nRainbow Dash: Me? Why?\nSmolder: Because everything's always awesome with you! Or twenty percent cooler! Or whatever! You're the most enthusiastic pony in Equestria when it's something you care about. I just wish we were one of those things.\n[door opens, closes]\nSnips: And it looks like my assistant cheer coach/souvenir selling business is a bust. So I'm gonna take off, unless you can think of something else for me to do.\nRainbow Dash: Maybe I can.\n\nOcellus and Yona: [snoring]\nSnips: [blows whistle]\nYona: Yaks hate loud noises!\nOcellus: Aah!\nSnips: Squad meeting! Outside! ASAP!\n\n[new age music]\n[record needle scratches]\nSnips: [blows whistle] Dance ponies, buckball field, pronto!\n[thud]\n\nSmolder: [snoring]\nSnips: [blows whistle] Hey, dragon!

We're not buying.\nRainbow Dash: Wait! Look, I know I haven't been a great coach because I don't care about cheerleading. But all of you do, and I care about you. So I guess maybe I care about cheer squad. And a good friend reminded me that I can make anything I care about totally awesome. So from now on, I'm gonna give this thing a hundred and twenty percent, and I expect the same from you. We are gonna dance! We are gonna cheer! We're gonna make the biggest pony pyramid Equestria's ever seen! And when we're done, we're gonna make sure everypony on that field is so pumped up, they'll forget they even came to see a game!\nSnips: Ah!

Was this one of those things where you knew the lesson I needed to learn before I learnt it?\nTwilight Sparkle: You mean like how you don't have to care about a thing other ponies like as long as you care about the ponies who like it?

How could I forget?\nTwilight Sparkle: And based on the regular attendees, I've charted every potential teammate's strengths and weaknesses, plus my percentage of winning with each one!\nSpike: Ha! I knew there'd be a chart! Glad I'm just watching. I don't think I could handle being your teammate. What if I let you down?\nTwilight Sparkle: [laughs] You could never let me down, Spike. But I'm glad you're watching, too. I'm going to need all the support I can get for win number three!\n[door opens]\n[indistinct conversations]\nApplejack: Well, well, well, if it ain't our reignin' champ. Think you can win again this week, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: Everypony here has a different area of expertise, so it really is anypony's game. But yes!\nRainbow Dash: Then you better hope you get paired with me, because I am gonna rule this game!\n[door opens]\nSunburst: We'll just see about that! I didn't come all the way from the Crystal Empire to lose. And I hope you realize I have the highest percentage of correct answers, and I aim to keep it that way.\nRainbow Dash: [whickers] I hope you realize not every category is gonna be \"Spells So Old, Not Even Star Swirl the Bearded Remembers Them\".\nFluttershy: I hope there's one on fur maintenance for adorable creatures, because I've been 'brushing up'. [giggles]\nAngel: [chitters angrily]\nMudbriar: Technically, that was a category last week.\nMaud Pie: It won't be in the game tonight.\nTwilight Sparkle: Rule thirty-seven point two C. No back-to-back categories. But I think Fluttershy was joking.\n[door opens]\nPinkie Pie: Sure sounded like a joke to me! [giggles] Woo-hoo!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie?!\nPinkie Pie: Present!\n[dramatic musical sting]\nTwilight Sparkle: [panicked muttering]\nSpike: What's wrong, Twilight?\nTwilight Sparkle: I hadn't anticipated Pinkie Pie as a potential player! She's never played before! My chart is completely off! I have no way to predict what'll happen, and unpredictable is not good for a Trivia Trot three-peat!\nSpike: Do I have to do that thing where I list all your successes as Princess of Friendship to put things into perspective and remind you this is just a game?\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike! This has nothing to do with being the Princess of Friendship! And this is not just a game! This! Is! Trivia Trot!\n[tapping]\nGranny Smith: Okay, settle down, everypony. I'm fixin' to pick these here teams.\n[crowd cheers]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] It's starting! I have to reevaluate my chart! Spike, I need you to find the part on matchups! Can you look outside?\n[teleportation zap]\n\n[door opens]\nSpike: What'd I miss?\nTwilight Sparkle: Granny's about to call out the fifth team. Sunburst gave me the highest chance of winning, but he's been paired with Cranky Doodle!\nCranky Doodle Donkey: [mumbles, muttering] What? Who's that?\nTwilight Sparkle: At least Rainbow Dash and Applejack aren't together. Team Apple-Dash is basically unstoppable.\nApplejack: [growls]\nRainbow Dash: [growls]\nTwilight Sparkle: And apart they'll spend all their energy trying to one-up each other, so that only helps my chances.\nBulk Biceps: Let's do this! Yeah!\nTwilight Sparkle: Eh, not every team is a threat, but there aren't many ponies left.\nGranny Smith: All righty, hold on to your horseshoes, 'cause the next pair of players is... Maud and Mudbriar!\n[crowd groans]\nSpike: What's wrong?\nTwilight Sparkle: Maud and Mudbriar have been paired together every week. It's a statistical improbability! Which would be fine if they weren't so good.\n[sizzling]\nTwilight Sparkle: [deep gasp] Oh, no! According to my calculations, the only pony who could really threaten my winning streak is...!\nGranny Smith: And our final pair of contestants for this week's Trivia Trot is... Twilight and Pinkie Pie!\nPinkie Pie: Twilight! It's you and me! Isn't that great?\n[clatter]\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah. Great.\n\nSpike: So, I'm guessing the one pony who could mess up your winning streak is Pinkie?\nPinkie Pie: Twilight! I can't believe we're partners for a game! I love games! And I'm super duper excited for this game because it'll be my first time ever playing, and I get to play with you, which makes it even funner!\n[zip!]\nPinkie Pie: Twilight and Pinkie Pie forever! Ooh! We could be Team Twinkie! Or [gasps] Team Pink-Light! [gasps] Sparkle Pie! No-no-no-no! [gasps] Twi-Pie! [squee]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie, I'm glad you're excited, but tonight's game is special. I could be the first pony ever to win three consecutive Trots in a row. And I'm really hoping I do.\nPinkie Pie: You don't have anything to worry about. I'll do everything I can to be the bestest and most funnest teammate ever.\n[bell ringing]\nSpike: So... still think you can win?\nTwilight Sparkle: [exhales] I know I can. Pinkie might not be the partner I expected, but I can coach her along. And besides, I'm pretty good at this game. If she misses a few, I'm sure I can pick up the slack.\n[airhorn blows]\nPinkie Pie: Let's get this party started!\nTwilight Sparkle: [laughs nervously]\n\nGranny Smith: Now, the first order of business is we need somepony to keep score.\nSpike: I'll do it!\nApplejack: [laughs] I'm not sure you wanna take that job, Spike. The score-keepin' can get a mite intense.\nSunburst: Yeah. Starlight used to do it, but now... Well, I can't even say the word \"trivia\" around her.\nGranny Smith: [scoffs] Apple mash. Don't let them scare ya. You'll be fine. Now, let the games begin!\n[crowd cheers]\n\n\n\n\nApplejack:\nGet ready to get squashed! Hey, don't copy me!\n\n\nRainbow Dash:\nGet ready to get squished! Hey, don't copy me!\n\n\nApplejack:\nGet ready to get squashed! Hey, don't copy me!\n\nRainbow Dash:\nGet ready to get squished! Hey, don't copy me!\n\nGranny Smith: The first category is \"Literary Figures\".\n[crowd groans]\nTwilight Sparkle: Ooh! A category about books! We're off to a great start!\nPinkie Pie: [giggles]\nGranny Smith: [clears throat] Who is the pony that despises the holiday season in the old classic A Hearth's Warmin' Tale?\n[bell rings]\nPinkie Pie: The answer is nopony! Because everypony ends up loving the holiday with singing, festive cakes, and thoughtful presents!\n[beat]\nGranny Smith: Well, as much as that ain't exactly wrong, it ain't exactly right neither.\nPinkie Pie: [laughs nervously]\nTwilight Sparkle: [whines]\nSpike: Just doing my job, Twilight.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\nPinkie Pie: Sorry. I didn't know we could have negative points.\nTwilight Sparkle: It's fine, Pinkie. But maybe it'll help our chances if I coach you as we go. Tip one \u2013 try sitting still.\nPinkie Pie: Can do, Coach Twilight\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: And don't get distracted. Or be distracting. Oh, and remember to listen carefully. Also, it's best to keep quiet between questions.\nPinkie Pie: Got it.\n\nPinkie Pie: [whimpers] Sitting still, sitting still, sitting still...! [continues under]\nGranny Smith: Which topographical locale used to be a cavern, but after thousands of years of erosion, is now a gorge?\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie!\nPinkie Pie: What?!\n[bell rings]\nMaud Pie: The answer is the Ghastly Gorge.\nGranny Smith: That is one hundred percent correct!\nApplejack: [chomp]\nGranny Smith: The next category is \"Apples\"!\nRainbow Dash: Rigged!\nApplejack: I didn't hear you complain when the category was \"Wonderbolt History\".\nRainbow Dash: But... [stutters] that-that's totally different!\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay, Pinkie. Remember, the category is \"Apples\". Keep your mind on apples.\nPinkie Pie: Apples, apples, apples, apples... Ooh, and oranges. And grapes! And strawberries. [gasps] Strawberry cupcakes! I'm hungry.\nGranny Smith: Which variety of apple only blooms for five days?\nRainbow Dash: [coughs] Don't choke. [whistles]\nApplejack: Now, why would I choke on a question about apples? Uh... What was the question again?\nGranny Smith: You kiddin' me?\nTwilight Sparkle: Come on, Pinkie, you know this one. Mysterious apples? Only around for five days?\nPinkie Pie: [gasps]\n[stomach growls]\nPinkie Pie: Quiet down there. Pretty sure there's a rule against tummies ringing in.\n[bell rings]\nFluttershy: Um, I'm just guessing, but is it zap apples?\nGranny Smith: Finally! Yes, Fluttershy, it is. At least somepony here knows her apples.\nBulk Biceps: Yeah!\n[thud]\nFluttershy: [weak laugh]\n[stomach growls]\n\nSpike: One minute left in the refreshment/bathroom break\u2014! Aah!\nTwilight Sparkle: Spike! I don't think I can coach Pinkie well enough for us to get my three-peat! I don't want her to feel bad! She's trying so hard, but I might have to start answering everything myself!\nPinkie Pie: Look, Twilight! No more belly growl interruptions for Team Twi-Pie! [chomps, gulps]\nSpike: Maybe instead of focusing on Pinkie, you should just focus on how you're playing.\nTwilight Sparkle: Or... I should look at how everypony else is playing.\nGranny Smith: Hope you're all in your seats 'cause the break is over, and it is time for more questions. [muttering] Let me see, uh... How do you say \"reward\" in Olde Ponish?\nPinkie Pie: [gasps]\n[smack!]\n[bell rings]\nCranky Doodle Donkey: [snoring]\nSunburst: \"Reward\" in Olde Ponish is \"hliet\".\nGranny Smith: Correct!\nTwilight Sparkle: Sleeping!\n[crowd muttering]\nTwilight Sparkle: [clears throat] Sunburst's partner is sleeping. And according to rule fifty-seven point six, sleeping on the table is subject to dis-qual-i-fi-ca-tion!\nGranny Smith: Oh, looky here. That's an actual rule. Cranky is disqualified. I'm sorry, Sunburst. Without your teammate, you can't play neither.\nSunburst: Aw, fine! But I'm counting that as a correct answer! [groans] Can't even stay awake for five minutes...\nTwilight Sparkle: Don't worry, Pinkie. We're not out of this game yet.\n\nAngel: [whispering]\nFluttershy: [gasps]\n[bell rings]\nFluttershy: Is the answer carrots?\nTwilight Sparkle: Ah! Rule thirteen point two! No help from pets!\n\nApplejack: Nyah!\nRainbow Dash: Nyah!\nTwilight Sparkle: Rule seventy-two point eight! No sticking tongues out at opponents!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Motion to establish new rule! No expressionless contestants!\nGranny Smith: Nice try.\nTwilight Sparkle: Fine.\nGranny Smith: The next category is... \"Cupcakes\"!\nPinkie Pie: [gasps] Twilight! I know all about those! You have to let me help!\nTwilight Sparkle: [exhales heavily] Suuuure! Just when we're finally back in the game! [laughs crazily] Why, that sounds perfect, Pinkie, but... Ooh! Isn't that a confetti appreciation parade I see?\nPinkie Pie: Where?!\n[zip!]\nGranny Smith: What flavor cupcakes did Princess Celestia order for Princess Luna's surprise birthday party last year?\nPinkie Pie: Wait, what?!\n[bell rings]\nTwilight Sparkle: Double midnight chocolate fudge with chili pepper frosting!\nGranny Smith: Correct!\nPinkie Pie: Hey! I knew that! I made those cupcakes!\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry, Pinkie. But you were looking at the parade, and I didn't want our team to miss out on the point.\nPinkie Pie: I guess that makes sense, but which way did that confetti parade go anyway?\n\n[bell rings]\nTwilight Sparkle: 1547 Pony B.E.!\n\n[smack!]\n[bell rings]\nTwilight Sparkle: Vanhoover!\n\n[splat]\n[bell rings]\nTwilight Sparkle: Cutie Pox!\n\n[bell rings]\nTwilight Sparkle: Bananaaaaas!\n\nGranny Smith: The category is \"Sticks and Stones\".\nTwilight Sparkle: [brays] I don't know anything about those! That's not any kind of category!\nMudbriar: Technically, it's a kind of category where we know the answers and you don't.\nTwilight Sparkle: [hyperventilating]\nPinkie Pie: Don't worry, fellow Twi-Pie. I grew up on a rock farm. I'm sure I know some of these.\nTwilight Sparkle: [hyperventilating faster]\nGranny Smith: What kind of stone can be used to start a fire?\n[bell rings]\nPinkie Pie: The black one!\nMaud Pie: The answer is flint.\nPinkie Pie: Yeah, that one! We both get points, right?\nSunburst: Sorry, Pinkie. Rule four \u2013 answers must be specific and exact. I'd help you if I could. I know this category pretty well.\nTwilight Sparkle: Gee, Pinkie! I forgot the name of that famous rock in Griffonstone. Could you ask Maud?\nPinkie Pie: You got it! Hey, Maud! What's the name of the famous rock in Griffonstone?\nMaud Pie: Pinkie, you can't ask me that.\nPinkie Pie: Sure I can. I just did.\n[crowd muttering]\nPinkie Pie: What?\nGranny Smith: You can't go and ask another player about rocks when that's the category. It's in the rulebook. Where's... Sorry, Pinkie, but you're disqualified.\nPinkie Pie: What?!\n[loud thud]\n\nPinkie Pie: I-I can't believe I'm disqualified! [whines]\nTwilight Sparkle: [laughs nervously] I'm sorry, Pinkie. Guess I forgot about that rule.\nPinkie Pie: Oh, no! If I'm out, you don't have a partner! You won't be able to get your third win!\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, since there's another player who has also had his teammate disqualified...\nSunburst: Rule nineteen point seven B, whereby players whose teammates were disqualified may form a new team.\nPinkie Pie: Oh. Okay. Um, I'll just cheer you on from... over there.\n[balloons deflate]\nGranny Smith: The next category is \"Ancient Legends\".\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, we're gonna crush this round!\nSunburst: I don't know, Twilight. You seem out of the zone today. But don't worry. I can pick up the slack.\nTwilight Sparkle: What?! I am the reigning Trot champ! If there's any slack that needs picking, I'll be the up! I mean, wait...\nSunburst: I'm just saying you seem a little frazzled, and I do have a correct answer percentage to maintain.\nGranny Smith: Who traveled to Equestria from a distant land seeking to steal the magic from its pony inhabitants?\n[bell rings]\nTwilight Sparkle: That would be Lord Tirek!\n[bell rings]\nMudbriar: Technically, that answer is incomplete. The answer is Lord Tirek and Scorpan.\nTwilight Sparkle: But Scorpan tried to convince Tirek not to do it, so technically he wasn't part of it, even if he started out\u2014! [groans] Never mind.\n\n[montage music]\n[bell rings]\n\n[bell rings]\n\nTwilight Sparkle: Look, Sunburst. I realize I may have been a little off earlier, but I'm really good at this game.\nGranny Smith: How many holes are there in Daring Do's hat?\n[bell rings]\nRainbow Dash: Twenty!\nGranny Smith: Correct!\nRainbow Dash: Ha!\nSunburst: Twilight, I knew that one! You just cost us a point and the correct answer I needed to boost my percentage!\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, I knew it, too. You're not the only pony to ever read a book, you know?\nSunburst: You're right, Twilight. I'm sorry. But now that I think about it, I'm not so sure about Dash's answer. Could you do a quick fact check?\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, I know it's twenty. But if you want proof... Wait! According to rule eighteen point three, I can't check outside reference material.\n[teleportation zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: [gasps] Are you trying to get me disqualified?! What kind of pony would do that to their own teammate?!\nSunburst: You're right, Twilight. I don't know what got into me. I was so focused on my correct answers, I wasn't thinking straight. Can you forgive me?\nTwilight Sparkle: It's okay, Sunburst. I understand. And I have a teammate of my own to apologize to. Lucky for you, Cranky's awake. And according to rule fifty-seven point six B...\nSunburst: Players previously disqualified for sleeping may rejoin the game. Provided they're well-rested.\nCranky Doodle Donkey: [mutters] Where am I? What time is it? Where are my morning haycakes?!\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie, you were the best teammate I could ask for, but I let wanting to win keep me from seeing that.\nPinkie Pie: [scoffs] I knew you wanted to win, but I probably could have helped a little. And even if I couldn't...\nTwilight Sparkle: ...we still could've had fun. I'm so sorry for not realizing it. I got so obsessed with one thing, I forgot what really mattered.\nPinkie Pie: [sarcastically] No! That doesn't sound like you at all!\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, win or lose, nothing is more important than my friend. Or my team. Twi-Pie forever?\nPinkie Pie: I-I don't know.\nTwilight Sparkle: I understand. I guess even the Princess of Friendship can mess things up with her friends.\nPinkie Pie: Oh, it's not that. It's  just that I already changed it to Team Twi-Burst, and now I guess I should change it to Sun-Doodle? [chomps]\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, I have a better idea.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: According to rule thirteen point two, players can join the game at any time, provided they start from zero.\nPinkie Pie: Wow. These rules are really convoluted. But doesn't starting from zero mean we'll lose?\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, our chances aren't good, but the odds of having fun on Team Twi-Pie are one hundred percent!\nGranny Smith: What is the name of the Ponyville Day Spa's most popular candle?\n[bell rings]\n\n\n\n\nPinkie Pie:\nCandlelicious Melty Wax!\n\n\nTwilight Sparkle:\nCompetitive Library Musk!\n\n\nPinkie Pie:\nCandlelicious Melty Wax!\n\nTwilight Sparkle:\nCompetitive Library Musk!\n\nGranny Smith: Uh... no.\nTwilight Sparkle and Pinkie Pie: [laugh]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nCozy Glow: [clears throat] Where are ya goin'?\nGrogar: Since you three were unable to retrieve my Bewitching Bell, we need another source of great magical power to defeat Twilight and her friends.\nCozy Glow: [singsongy] He's gone!\nLord Tirek: I don't trust him.\nCozy Glow: None of us do.\nQueen Chrysalis: Which is why double-crossing him with his own bell will be so satisfying.\nLord Tirek: If we can figure out how to use it.\nQueen Chrysalis: Hmmm...\n[rattling]\nCozy Glow: Twilight Sparkle may be the worst, but she does know stuff. She once said the Archives in Canterlot has a restricted area.\nLord Tirek: Celestia and Luna love to hoard information for themselves. If there's an answer, it's there.\nQueen Chrysalis: My triumphant return to Canterlot? I like the sound of that.\nCozy Glow: Oh, my gosh! Road trip!\n\n[theme song]\n\n[door opens]\nPrincess Celestia: Sorry to interrupt. We know you're busy planning the Summer Sun Celebration as we requested. But...\nPrincess Luna: Oh! Things seem, uh, calmer than we would've expected.\nSpike: No complaints here.\nTwilight Sparkle: With the exception of the odd trivia night, I've made a lot of progress since the Royal Swanifying Ceremony. You may not know this about me, but I occasionally freak out.\n[beat]\nTwilight Sparkle: That was a joke. I wanted to show you with the Summer Sun Celebration how much I've improved. So I focused on delegating and trusting others. It's been great!\nPrincess Luna: That's... actually what we came to talk to you about. This may be the last Summer Sun Celebration you'll need to plan.\nTwilight Sparkle: Did I do something wrong?\nPrincess Celestia: Of course not. It's just that the Celebration has always been about us. My defeat of Luna...\nPrincess Luna: ...and, thanks to you and your friends, my reunion with my sister.\nPrincess Celestia: Now that we're leaving, we don't see a need for the holiday any longer.\nTwilight Sparkle: Now that you're...\nPrincess Celestia: My sister and I have decided. The time for us to retire is upon us. You and your friends have proven you are ready to lead Equestria. So let this be the last Summer Sun Celebration as Equestria leaves behind the old to embrace the new!\nTwilight Sparkle: [gulps]\n\nRarity: My goodness! How are you feeling about all this?\nPinkie Pie: Something like this could definitely send you into full freaky-outy mode!\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm actually fine. But if this is gonna be the last Summer Sun Celebration, I want to make sure it's the best Celebration ever!\nRainbow Dash: [whispering] Please-don't-give-us-more-work... Please-don't-give-us-more-work... Please-don't-give-us-more-work...\nTwilight Sparkle: So, even though everything was done, I thought of a few last-minute changes I could use your help with.\nRainbow Dash: [groans] I knew it!\nDiscord: [echoing] Oh, the end of a beloved holiday? Last-minute changes to a celebration?\n[poof!]\nDiscord: That sounds positively chaotic!\nApplejack: What are you doin' here?\nDiscord: I've known Celestia and Luna longer than any of you. I terrorized them, they turned me into stone...\n[crack]\n[crumble]\nDiscord: If this is the last Summer Sun Situation, I simply can't miss it. Well, I see I've arrived just in time for the \"Twilight gives her friends an impossibly long and overly detailed list\" predicament.\nTwilight Sparkle: I guess some draconequus isn't the know-it-all he thinks he is.\nRainbow Dash: This is it?\nTwilight Sparkle: What?\nRainbow Dash: We were kinda with Discord on this one.\nTwilight Sparkle: No more crazy lists. No more freaking out. With your help, I know we've got this.\nDiscord: [groans] Character growth is so boring. Do I at least get my own note card?\nTwilight Sparkle: There. Now, I need to go rewrite my speech. But if you all look at your cards, you'll see\u2014\nDiscord: Can't talk now. Have so much to get done before sunrise. [snaps fingers]\n[poof!]\n[clatter]\n\nLord Tirek: Why are so many ponies up in the middle of the night?\nCozy Glow: It's that silly sun holiday.\nQueen Chrysalis: How many holidays do you ponies have? No matter. Getting into the castle won't be a problem.\nLord Tirek: Are you sure about that?\n[fans whirring]\n[bird chirping]\nQueen Chrysalis: Oh. Those are new. But even so...\n[transformation noise]\n\n[wood creaking]\nQueen Chrysalis: [affected voice] Transfer. Have to head inside. Open up.\n[door opens]\n[door closes]\nQueen Chrysalis: Right. Of course. [laughs nervously]\n[thuds]\nQueen Chrysalis: Uh, do yours get glitchy too? More medallions, more problems, am I right?\n\nQueen Chrysalis: [normal voice] They've increased security into the castle. This is going to be more challenging than I thought.\n[transformation noise]\n[poof!]\nRainbow Dash: Could you not go popping us all over the place, please?!\nDiscord: Time is of the essence. Let's go, team!\nFluttershy: We need to know what we're doing before we go and do it.\nApplejack: Pinkie, you and I are givin' Braeburn and the Appleloosan ponies some adjustments to the menu.\nRainbow Dash: Fluttershy and I are meeting the Pegasi from Cloudsdale to give them changes to the weather.\nRarity: Spike, we're going to update the Flaming Sky Firework Unicorn Troupe with Twilight's new vision.\nDiscord: And I'm supposed to... [reading] \"make sure Discord doesn't do anything 'Discord-y'\"? Well, that's annoyingly specific!\nLord Tirek: Increased security on a crowded holiday with Twilight and her friends bumbling around? This is impossible.\nQueen Chrysalis: Oh, no. This is perfect. We need a distraction, and those ridiculous ponies just gave it to us. Now, do exactly as I tell you.\n\n[ponies gasp]\nPinkie Pie: Step away from the wagons! Official food-tasters here on official food-tasting business! [eating noisily]\nBraeburn: [sighs] Well, it ain't gonna be easy. But I think we can whip up these new cookies Twilight wants before sunrise.\nApplejack: If anypony can handle some last-minute bakin', Braeburn, it's y'all.\nPinkie Pie: [chomps, gulps]\nBraeburn: We brought plenty for the Celebration. But if she keeps testin', we might be in trouble.\nPinkie Pie: [chomps, gulps] But I see a suspicious-looking cookie!\n[magic sounds]\nBraeburn: You okay?\n[bushes rustle]\nApple Honey: I feel weak all of a sudden...\n[magic sounds]\nBraeburn: Is somepony back there?\n[magic sounds]\nApple Cobbler: What is it?\nBraeburn: Everypony... get away from the food... 'til we figure out what's goin' on...!\n[ponies screaming]\n[bushes rustle]\nLord Tirek: [laughing]\n\nFeather Flatterfly: The princess wants what?!\nRainbow Dash: Just what's on that little card. No big deal.\nFeather Flatterfly: No big d-d\u2014?! I-I-It's a m-much more aggressive weather pattern than what was originally ordered! This... This is... very irregular! We'll need to... No, first we must... Wait! We ca\u2014 [wails]\nFluttershy: Take a breath.\nFeather Flatterfly: [inhales]\nFluttershy: Let it out slowly.\nFeather Flatterfly: [exhales] Tell the princess we will do our best.\nFluttershy: We're sure you're doing an excellent job.\nRainbow Dash: Oh, yeah, totally. You're not gonna panic and screw it up at all!\nFeather Flatterfly: I... I... I'm not built for high-pressure situations!\nCozy Glow: Golly. Sounds like you need some help.\nFeather Flatterfly: Who are you?\nCozy Glow: Somepony who's organized enough to handle the small stuff so you can focus on the big picture!\nFeather Flatterfly: The big... Yes! That sounds right!\nCozy Glow: [chuckles] This kind of weather has to be handled delicately. Good thing I'm here. I'll take care of everything.\n\n[fireworks explode]\nSpike: Whoa!\nRarity: The Flaming Sky Firework Troupe is a marvel.\nFire Flare: We take pride in what we do.\nSpike: These last-minute changes aren't too challenging, are they?\nFire Flare: Ha! The more challenging, the better! We aim to astound! Now, if you don't mind, we do have a new routine to prepare. Horns at the ready!\n[transformation noise]\nQueen Chrysalis: Very impressive.\nFire Flare: Thank you. Unfortunately, we have no room for anypony else at this time... [clears throat] I'm sorry?\nQueen Chrysalis: Crackle Cosette. And I don't want to join your silly little troupe.\nFire Flare: Pardon me?\nQueen Chrysalis: Oh, I meant no offense. It just seems a pity for unicorns to waste their talents on something so... inconsequential.\n[unicorns muttering]\nQueen Chrysalis: Unicorns wield magic. We are the most powerful ponies in the land. Don't you ever feel you're destined for more than... performances?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: It's all coming together. I really think this is gonna be the best Summer Sun Celebration ever!\nRarity: You've done an outstanding job.\nTwilight Sparkle: We've all done an outstanding job!\n[screech]\nDiscord: And what about me? You'll be happy to know that I have been watching myself all night, and I have yet to do one \"Discord-y\" thing.\nPrincess Luna: Now, that truly is amazing.\nPrincess Celestia: Twilight, we know you had, uh, [laughs] difficulties using the amulet to raise the sun and moon. We thought perhaps a practice session before the festivities might be in order.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's... a good idea. Thank you all so much.\n[doors close]\nApplejack: I sure am proud o' her.\nSpike: Yeah! She finally realizes things will turn out fine, even when she isn't micromanaging every little detail.\n[thud]\nApplejack: Braeburn? W-What's wrong?\nBraeburn: Earth ponies sick... Food missin'... Can't... bake... anythin'...\nRoyal Guard: Something is wrong with the weather! Storms, hurricanes, fog \u2013 you name it! It's a disaster out there!\nFire Flare: Rarity! Please inform her highness that we will not be performing! A simple fireworks show is beneath us! We're better than that!\nApplejack: What the...? Everything was fine a minute ago!\nFluttershy: Apparently, a lot can change in a minute.\n[ponies moaning]\n[thunder]\n[ponies panicking]\nRainbow Dash: It's total chaos out there!\n[beat]\nDiscord: Don't look at me.\nFluttershy: What are we gonna do?\nTwilight Sparkle: Do about what?\nSpike: [laughs nervously] What are you doing here?\nTwilight Sparkle: I forgot these. You guys okay?\nApplejack: Twilight, w-we're sorry, but\u2014\nRainbow Dash: But, uh, we don't know what to do now that everything's all ready! [forced laugh]\nTwilight Sparkle: I guess I was too organized. I'll try to come up with a few last-minute errands for you before sunrise.\nRainbow Dash: [stilted] Well, that's a relief!\nApplejack: Explain to me why we didn't tell her the truth.\nRarity: Oh, Twilight is finally learning not to let her stress get the better of her. If she finds out everything went wrong, it could be devastating!\nFluttershy: Oh, she would be so upset.\nRainbow Dash: She'll totally freak out!\nApplejack: Well, what do y'all suggest?\nPinkie Pie: Ooh, ooh, ooh! Let's just fix it all before she notices. No lying necessary.\nApplejack: I guess.\nSpike: We'd need a miracle.\nRainbow Dash: We have a miracle! Don't we?\n[poof!]\nDiscord: I suppose I could fix everything. But isn't the real miracle here the miracle of teamwork and character growth?\n[poof!]\nRainbow Dash: OH, COME ON!\nFluttershy: Discord is right. Twilight needs us. Whatever happened, we can fix this.\n[thunder and lightning]\nSpike: What did happen?\n[ponies screaming]\nCozy Glow: Best... road trip... ever!\n\nPinkie Pie: Even if I was an actual doctor, I would have no idea what's wrong.\nApplejack: There's gotta be a reason.

I... was really hungry?\n[unicorns grumbling]\nRarity: Nopony understands wanting to take pride in your work more than I do!\nUnicorn 1: You could do more with your magic than make frilly dresses!\nRarity: Oh, pffft. Nopony makes frills anymore. This season's actually all about simplicity\u2014\nSpike: Not the point, Rarity!\nFeather Flatterfly: Princess! I beg your forgiveness! It's entirely my fault!\nTwilight Sparkle: What is?\n[thunder and lightning]\nFeather Flatterfly: That!\nFluttershy: Oh, um, just a slight hiccup in the weather. [laughs nervously]\n[whoosh]\nApplejack: [grunting]\nTwilight Sparkle: Applejack, what is going on?\nApplejack: I told y'all this was a bad idea! But nopony ever listens to me!\nTwilight Sparkle: That's it!\nRest of Mane Six and Spike: [yelp, groan]\nTwilight Sparkle: I thought everything was fine! What is going on?!\nApplejack: Everythin' was goin' fine.\nPinkie Pie: Until it totally wasn't.\nFluttershy: We tried to fix it ourselves.\nTwilight Sparkle: Why didn't you tell me?\nRainbow Dash: We didn't want you to freak out.\nTwilight Sparkle: And you thought not telling me everything was a total disaster would avoid a freak-out?!\nSpike: When you say it like that, it sounds like a really bad plan.\nTwilight Sparkle: [inhales]\nDiscord: Here it comes!\nTwilight Sparkle: I know how I used to react, but I really have changed. Panicking won't solve anything. But we can handle whatever problems come our way as long as we handle them together!\nPrincess Celestia: Spoken like a true leader. How can we help?\nTwilight Sparkle: I love a good to-do list.

But as we look towards Equestria's future, I am sad to say today will be the last Summer Sun Celebration.\n[crowd gasps]\nTwilight Sparkle: Because there is something even more important to celebrate. There are two ponies who have watched over us night and day for as long as we can remember. We will no longer commemorate their battle or their reunion. Instead, we will take this day to celebrate how much they mean to all of us. From this day forward, today will be known as the Festival of the Two Sisters!\n[crowd cheers]\nPrincess Celestia: We don't know what to say.\nPinkie Pie: [giggles] A brand new holiday? You're my kind of princess!\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm just glad we pulled it off.\nApplejack: About that... We just wanted to say we're real sorry.\nRarity: You did tell us you'd changed.\nFluttershy: As your friends, we should've trusted you.\nRainbow Dash: Next time you say you're not gonna freak out, we'll believe you.\nTwilight Sparkle: Good. Because I'm sure there's gonna be plenty of things I'll need my best friends' help with.\nPinkie Pie: Whee-hee!\nMane Six except Pinkie Pie: Aah!\n[thud]\nMane Six: [laughing]\nDiscord: You know, it really does seem like you just might be ready for whatever comes next, your Majesty. [chewing]\n\nCozy Glow: Sooooo did you find what you're looking for?\nGrogar: Once again, I've found success where you all find failure. I have located what I sought, and tomorrow I will set out to retrieve it. When I return, Equestria will finally be ours for the taking.\nLord Tirek: Hmph!\nQueen Chrysalis: Oh, stop pouting.\nCozy Glow: You knew you couldn't stay that buff. You had to return all the life force to those Earth ponies so Grogar doesn't suspect anything.\nLord Tirek: I don't have to like it.\nCozy Glow: Well, I don't like that we worked so hard to destroy their party and they still pulled it off. But you don't see me complaining!\nQueen Chrysalis: Our goal wasn't to destroy. It was to distract. And now we have exactly what we need.\nLord Tirek: And no time to waste. We have to master the Bell before Grogar returns.\nQueen Chrysalis: We've managed to stay one step ahead of everypony so far.\nCozy Glow: You know, it really was super easy to get all those Earth ponies and Pegasi and unicorns to turn on each other.\nQueen Chrysalis: It was, wasn't it? Now that is something to think about...\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nAntoine: [hissing]\nFluttershy: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh. Antoine believes what he eats is his business.

Just because you're on opposite ends of the food chain doesn't mean you can't work\u2014\nMuriel: [trumpets]\nFluttershy: Huh?

[sighs] I'm sorry, but the more you distract everyone, the longer this will take.\nAngel: [angry chittering]\nFluttershy: I am listening to you. But if you really want to be heard, you should join our predator/prey support group. Then you can talk to everyone here. You could teach all these hungry predators the delights of a carrot-based cuisine. Sorry, everyone. I think somebunny just wants a little attention. Now, since we all need to get along, what if all predators promise to only eat vegetables while staying at the sanctuary?\nHarry: [low growl]\n[animals chattering]\nSandra: [whines]\nFluttershy: Oh, Sandra, you can do it.\n[stomach growls]\nSandra: [whines, growls]\nFluttershy: [gasps] Angel, Sandra, wait!\nSandra: [barking]\n[rumbling]\nHarry: [roars]\n[crash!]\n[animal sounds]\n[fighting sounds]\nDr. Fauna: It might look like chaos, but Fluttershy makes it work, even with Angel running around.\nZecora: Ohhhh. Perhaps I can help those two get along before something here can go terribly wrong.\n\n[theme song]\n\n[birds chirping]\nDr. Fauna: Zecora found this little guy and brought him to my office. But I thought he might do better at the sanctuary.\n[poof]\nAngel: [coughing]\nZecora: Bringing him here seemed the right thing to do. I've never seen geckos breathe smoke though. Have you?\nFluttershy: Ooh. I certainly haven't.\nDr. Fauna: I thought we could take a look at his diet. Plus, it's about time for me to give all the animals here a checkup.\nFluttershy: That's a wonderful idea.\n[lizard chirping]\nFluttershy: If we really want to know what's going on, we need to make sure the problem isn't your food.\n[stomach growls]\nFluttershy: I wouldn't worry too much. It's probably just something he's been eating. Oh. [grunts] Um, is there anything else we can do for you?\nZecora: Ahhh. Seeing what you two do, the real question is \u2013 can I help you?\nAngel: [blows raspberry]\nFluttershy: You mean me and Angel?\nZecora: Mm-hmm.\nFluttershy: Oh, he's fine! We're fine! I... I just don't always have time to indulge him. But we're best friends!\nZecora: Even the best of friends need help from time to time. Come visit me in my hut, should you change your mind.\nFluttershy: Okay, thanks! But Angel and I are great!\nDr. Fauna: Oh, goodness, Fluttershy. Is this the list of what you do every day? [chuckles] How do you find time for anything else?\nFluttershy: Between here and teaching at the school, I'm not sure I do. You're gonna love it here, little gecko.\n[lizard chirps]\nFluttershy: What is it? Not fluffy enough?\n[lizard chirps]\nFluttershy: Oh, sorry. We need to see if your food is causing your issue.\n[lizard purring]\nFluttershy: Huh? Hmm. Not now, Angel.\n\nAntoine: [hisses]\nFluttershy: There's snake treats made to look like chocolate chip cookies.\nAntoine: [chews, gulps]\nFluttershy: They're vegan. Pinkie Pie made a whole jar of them. They're all yours if you promise. No more trying to eat Muriel the baby elephant. [gasps] No, Angel. I have too much to do.\n\nClementine: [coughing]\nDr. Fauna: Oh, careful, girl. That neck is still pretty sore.\nFluttershy: Don't forget to shift your weight, Scout!\nScout: [snoring]\nDr. Fauna: [sighs] What does she want?\nFluttershy: Her neck is feeling better, but a massage every day for the next week wouldn't hurt. I'll add it to my list.\nDr. Fauna: [laughs] Fluttershy, I've said it before, but I'll say it again. This place would be a... zoo without you! [laughs, snorts]\n[thunk!]\nFluttershy: Angel!\n[beat]\nFluttershy: Listen to you for once? Just what exactly is that supposed to mean?!\nAngel: [chitters]\nFluttershy: Come back! I-I meant tell me, not\u2014! [groans]\nDr. Fauna: Well, whatever it is, you're the only one he can tell about it.

Every day this week, you've been causing trouble when I have work to do!\nAngel: [chitters]\nFluttershy: Of course I know you can't talk to anypony else. But that's not my fault. I have responsibilities!\nAngel: [growls]\nFluttershy: You're right. We can't go on like this. I guess we do need to see Zecora for help.\n\nZecora: No need to sit and silently stew. Tell each other what's bothering you.\nFluttershy: He's so impatient, even when he knows I have work to do.\n[beat]\nFluttershy: Well, that's not true. We talk all the time.\n[beat]\nFluttershy: Of course talking at the sanctuary counts. That's where I am when I don't have a class to teach.\n[beat]\nFluttershy: What do you mean that's the problem?\n[beat]\nFluttershy: You feel like I'm the only pony you can talk to, and all I do is ignore you? Well, I feel like you don't care about my responsibilities.\n[beat]\nFluttershy: [laughs nervously] Um, as you can see, we're kind of at an impasse.\nZecora: Ahhh, such luck, your coming here indeed. Behold, the antidote you need.\nFluttershy: Is this what you meant by \"help us\"?\nZecora: When trouble brews between you two, turning sister against brother, true understanding is what's due. Each must come to know the other. There's no time to waste. Go directly home. But you both must taste when you're finally alone.\n\nFluttershy: Not yet, Angel. Zecora told us to take it together when we got home.\n[beat]\nFluttershy: Hmm. I suppose we could dust off the old picnic blanket. It'll be just like old times. We'll drink the potion and settle in for a nice tea party. I can barely remember the last time we did that. I've been so busy at the sanctuary. Though I really need to keep an eye on Zecora's gecko, and I haven't finished any of today's chores. If I don't, the animals won't get the care they need. Ohh. Maybe we should just save the potion until af\u2014 Angel! Zecora said to go home first!\n[pop!]\n[splash]\nAngel: [gulps, burps]\nFluttershy: I know she said we have to take it together, so...

Am I a pony? Why am I a pony?!\nFluttershy: [high-pitched scream]\n\nAngel: Question. Did we switch bodies?\n[thud]\nAngel: Whoa! Gah! Guh! Whoooaaa-whoa-whoa! Seriously? I'm a pony? La-la-la-la! Talking is so cool. Do you think this is what Zecora meant to happen?\n[beat]\nAngel: How are you gonna do your chores?! Really? That's what you're worried about?\n[beat]\nAngel: [scoffs] Well, maybe I don't want to switch back. I've only been able to talk to you since we met. And now I can talk to anypony I want! [to Rose] Roses are red, violets are blue! You sell flowers... [to Daisy] ...and so do you!\n[zip!]\nAngel: [to \"Cultivar\"] Rubber baby buggy bumpers!

[gasps, sniffs] Are there carrots around here?\n[beat]\nAngel: You think Zecora gave us the wrong potion, so you're gonna go to her hut in the forest and get something to switch us back?\n[beat]\nAngel: All by yourself? You really don't know what it's like being a bunny.\n[beat]\nAngel: Good luck with that! I'm gonna go find those carrots!\n[thudding]\nAngel: I need to finish your chores? [laughs] I don't work for you. And caring about other animals is a \"you\" thing.\n[warbling]\nAngel: [gasps] The Stare?! You can still do that? Ugh!

I talk to animals, I want to marry Discord\u2014\nDr. Fauna: Your list is over there.\nAngel: [sarcastically] Oh, yeah. There's my good old list of chores that I will absolutely not rush through because I definitely do not have better things to do. Well, well, well. Remember me?\n\nSpike: [shudders] I hope the gem tart stall is still there again. I could use a snack!\nTwilight Sparkle: You nearly bought every tart they had last time, Spike. I can't imagine they wouldn't show up when there's a great customer like you. Oh, hi, Angel. What's going on?\n[beat]\nTwilight Sparkle: Do you know what he's trying to say?\nSpike: Nope.\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry, Angel. You should probably find Fluttershy. If I see her, I'll let her know you're looking for her.\nFluttershy: [panting]\n[tense music]\n\nSandra: [stressed barking, whines]\nAngel: And we're gonna keep at it until you start to develop a taste for it!\nSandra: [whines]\nAngel: Uh...

How about we do bedtime now?\n[lizard chirps]\nAngel: Yeah, eating makes me tired, too. Which reminds me. There's some carrot extract with my name on it. Okay! Let's get you fed and off to dreamland! What do you eat anyway?\n[lizard chirps]\nAngel: [to Antoine] What do you say, snake? Can you find something else to eat if I borrow those cookies for my friend here?\n[jar clinks]\n[lizard gulping, burps]\nAngel: Eh, I'm sure that's normal. There you go. Problem solved.

Did things work out for you in the end?\n[beat]\nZecora: I'm... sorry, dear bunny, that things seem so grave. But I don't understand when you sign and wave. A single link to all the world. Only one in all the land. How special she must be to you, the one who understands. Perhaps if you explain what you wanted to some pony who understood. If you truly felt heard and valued, all would return to good.

But more technically, it's not my list.\nDr. Fauna: You wrote it!\nAngel: Did I though?\nDr. Fauna: What's gotten into you?!\nAngel: You do not want to know.\n[thud]\nDr. Fauna: Huh? Angel?\nAngel: What's wrong with her\u2014 h-him?! What happened?\nDr. Fauna: He's exhausted!\nAngel: [whimpers]\nDr. Fauna: Fluttershy! I need a jar of concentrated carrot extract! Stat!\nAngel: Ah!

And I totally deserve it. I did not provide you with the care that Fluttershy would. But now you know what it's like not to get the level of attention to which you've become accustomed!\nSandra: [grunts]\nAngel: The point is... Fluttershy is trapped in my bunny body. If we don't help her, maybe none of us will get her attention! I get that you don't want to help me.

I guess Fluttershy was right. Predators and prey can work together.\n\nAngel: [grunting, panting] This place is so... much... work!\nDr. Fauna: Oh, I know. I have no clue how you do it all. But we are so grateful.\nAngel: I can't believe she does this every day! I just wish I could tell her myself.\nDr. Fauna: What?\nAngel: [whimpers] You're awake!\n[beat]\nAngel: It was so hard getting to Zecora's hut? And impossible getting back? You can't believe I survive like this?\n[beat]\nAngel: Well, I can't believe you work here every day! These animals are crazy! No wonder you don't have time for me.\n[beat]\nAngel: My life is hard? No, your life is hard!\n[beat]\nAngel: You never appreciated me? No! I never appreciated you!\n[beat]\nAngel: You're sorry? I'm sorry, too! Come here, you little bunny who's a pony who's a bunny!

I can come here and talk to all of you. And now that I know how much work goes into this place, I suppose I can kinda sorta help out every now and then.\"\n[squirrels chitter]\nSandra: [grunts]\nFluttershy: Oh, Angel. That is so sweet.

He's a fire lizard.\n[fire whooshes]\nDr. Fauna: I forgot that before they get their flame, it's hard to tell them apart.

Do you think you could've done something that unintentionally hurt his feelings?\nRarity: Well, if I didn't realize what I did, how would I know what I have done when I did it?

He went to go make us a\u2014\nRarity: That's perfect! It'll give me a chance to practice. Uh, you stand there and tell me if I hit the right apologetic notes.\nGabby: What are you apologizing for?\nRarity: Darling, I don't see why that matters.\n[clattering]\n[gems clinking]\n[thud]\n[ka-chunk!]\n[deep boom]\n[music playing]\nRarity: [overdramatically] And that is why I simply cannot bear the thought of having hurt you! And even though I don't know what it is that I did, I want you to know that it doesn't matter! Because I am prepared to do anything to make it right! [sobs] And scene.\n[ka-chunk!]\nGabby: [muffled speech]\nRarity: Oh, sorry, dear. Here.\nGabby: I said, that sure sounds genuine.\nRarity: Well, of course it sounds genuine! It is genuine!\n[thud]\nSpike: Rarity? What are you doing?\nRarity: Obviously, I'm working on my apology to you, Spike. I don't know how I could be more genuine. I mean\u2014 [gasps] Spike!\n[zip!]\n[ka-chunk!]\n[deep boom]\n[music playing]\nRarity: [overdramatically] Oh, Spike! I am so sorry! Please forgive me!\n[crash!]\n[cat yowls]\nRarity: [overdramatically] You have to forgive me! I don't know what I did or why you're mad at me! Just please say you forgive me! [wailing] Pleeeeeeeease!\nSpike: Of course I forgive you. But, uh, what are you apologizing for?\n[ka-chunk!]\nRarity: Why does everypony keep harping on that\u2014?! Wait. Don't you know?\nSpike: No, I'm not mad at you about anything.\nRarity: B-But... But I don't understand. If you're not upset with me, why in Equestria would you refuse to go to the gem cave?\nSpike: Uh, because I had other plans?\n[clattering]\nGabby: With me!\nRarity: [gasps]\n\nRarity: I don't understand. You two know each other?\nSpike: Gabby and I are sort of pen pals.\nGabby: Yeah! There was this whole thing where I pretended to get a cutie mark because griffons don't get cutie marks, so Princess Twilight had Spike send a bunch of letters off to Griffonstone about the first griffon ever to get a cutie mark! Which I didn't really have.\nSpike: Gabby wrote back explaining things, and after that we just started writing back and forth.\nGabby: Turns out we have a lot in common! We both come from cultures that don't have the friendliest of reputations.\nSpike: [slurps] And we're both in the message-sending business!\nGabby: Uh-huh!\nSpike and Gabby: [chomp, gulp]\nGabby: I sure wish I could send scrolls with my breath!\nSpike and Gabby: [laughing]\nRarity: [forced laugh] Yes... Now I understand why you didn't come to the gem cave. Having a friend in town is a rare treat. Well, since you're busy today, maybe we can do something tomorrow. Fabric shopping? I know how you love to pick out the colors.\nSpike: Uh, actually, now that there's a griffon at Twilight's school, Gabby's here all the time.\nGabby: Grampa Gruff asks for a lot of updates about how Gallus is doing. [sighs] Speaking of which, I better get going.\nSpike: I'll fly with you.\nRarity: Well, all right. You two fly along. I'm sure Spike and I can do something some other\u2014\n[beat]\nRarity: ...time?\n\nRarity: I cannot decide which shade of purple is the most royal! And there's the pink! How will I ever choose?!\nRainbow Dash: [grunting] Too bad Spike's not here. I bet he could help you narrow it down.\nRarity: He is a good sounding board, isn't he?\n[muffled thud]\n[curtains close]\n\n[montage music]\n\n[camera clicks]\n[bits clinking]\n\n[door opens]\n\n[door opens]\n[thud]\n[slurping]\n\n[sewing machine whirring]\nRarity: [sighs] Could you bring the pincushion a little closer, dear? I suppose now that Spike's always so busy with Gabby, I'm just now realizing how much his presence has meant to me over the years.\n[beat]\nRarity: Even closer, darling. I don't want to prick you. I have to admit everything feels a bit \"less than\" without him. Too close!\n[thud]\nRarity: Oh, darling, it's no use. Thank you for trying. I'm just accustomed to the help of a small, highly attentive dragon.\nFluttershy: Maybe you should let Spike know how grateful you are for everything he's done for you.\n\nSpike: [snoring] Aah!\nRarity: Oh, I am sorry, Spike. I didn't mean to frighten you.\nSpike: Rarity? What are you doing here?\nRarity: Well, I realize it's late. Or rather, early. But I have a surprise, and I just couldn't wait to share it. The Great Gem Crevasse of the Crystal Mountains!\n[click]\nSpike: Whoa!\nRarity: It is only accessible once a year, and I thought a little day trip would make a wonderful thank you for all the help you've given me over the years.\nSpike: Oh. But I'm supposed to meet Gabby today for her rounds.\nRarity: I see. Well, there's always next year.\n[door opens]\nSpike: You know what? I'll just write her a note.\nRarity: Are you sure?\nSpike: Absolutely.\n\n[train chugging]\n[train hisses]\n[gems clinking]\nSpike: Wow. Rarity, you weren't kidding. The Gem Crevasse was amazing! I'll be snacking on these for a week.\nRarity: What did I tell you?\nGabby: Hey, Spike!\nSpike: Gabby! You won't believe where I went today!\nGabby: Actually, I think I will. I got your scroll. The Great Gem Crevasse sounds a lot better than doing my rounds.\nSpike: Mm-hmm!\n[gems clinking]\nGabby: Whoa! It was definitely better! I gotta get back to Griffonstone, but you have to tell me all about the Crevasse tomorrow!\nSpike: Absolutely! [grunts] Thanks again, Rarity. What a great day.\n\nGabby: Okay! Start from the beginning, because I want to hear everything!\nSpike: Well, to get to the Crevasse, you have to climb across a rope bridge because the air's too thin to fly!\nGabby: That is amazing! Then what?!\n[thud]\nGabby: Whoa!\nSpike: Sorry, Rarity!\nRarity: Oh, no apology necessary, Spike. In fact, I was just looking for you.\nSpike: You were? Why?\nRarity: Because I just acquired... these!\nSpike: Passes to Power Ponypalooza!? For today!?\nRarity: Mm-hmm! I know we just went to the Crevasse, but I feel I've barely scratched the surface of expressing my gratitude for all you do.\nSpike: Uh... of course I want to go, but that'll be two days in a row we haven't hung out.\nGabby: Nah! Are you kidding? It's Power Ponypalooza! You have to go! And now you'll have two things to tell me about!\nSpike: Okay! Come on, Rarity! Let's go!\n\nSpike: Whew! Are my claws sore.\nRarity: Indeed. I had no idea how much walking there is at a Power Pony convention!\nSpike: [grunting] Aww. I know I told Gabby we'd hang out tomorrow, but I might need the whole day to rest.\nRarity: Whoo. I know what you mean. Perhaps you could, uh, just send her another note.\nRarity and Spike: [grunting]\nSpike: [chuckles] I think maybe you're right.\nRarity: Honestly, I might need to spend tomorrow putting my hooves up as well. [laughs]\n[door opens]\n\n[knock on door]\n[door opens]\nRarity: I hadn't counted on Power Ponypalooza being quite so draining, but I thought we might spend the day recuperating together.\nSpike: No way! Ogres & Oubliettes?!\nRarity: Well, I know how much you enjoy it. And this seemed like the perfect opportunity for you to teach me the game.\n\n[door opens]\nGabby: [echoing] Spike? I got your note! I figured I'd come by before my rounds with a bowl of energizing turnip soup.\nRarity and Spike: [laughter fading in]\nRarity: Can Princess Shmarity use her Shield of the Coiffure to defend herself from the purveyor of poor color coordination?\nSpike: Oh, she can try... Success! Shmarity's shield holds against the Green-Eyed Monster's attack! And then\u2014!\nGabby: Spike?\nSpike: Oh, hi, Gabby. We were just\u2014\nGabby: Your scroll said you were too tired to do anything today. But I guess you were just too tired to do anything with me.\nSpike: No-no-no-no! That's not true! I can come with you on your rounds right now!\nGabby: I don't think so, Spike. Maybe I'll just handle the rounds on my own from now on.\n[thermos clinking]\nRarity: Oooh! Princess Shmarity uses her Prismatic Beam to change that poor monster's color to a more pleasing shade of purple!\n\nRarity: What do you think, Spike? Solids or prints?\nSpike: [sighs] Prints, I guess. You already have a lot of solid colors.\nRarity: Oh, you are so right. Prints it is! So nice to have you back, Spike.\n[cash register rings]\nRarity: Although I hope you're able to reconcile with Gabby.\nSpike: I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to.\n\n[montage music]\n\nRarity: I quite enjoyed our day together today, Spike.\nSpike: Yeah...\nTwilight Sparkle: Hi, Spike.\nSpike: Uh-huh...\nTwilight Sparkle: Hmmm. I've never seen Spike this sad before. Do you know what happened?\nRarity: [clears throat] Yes, well, perhaps he's still just tired from Power Ponypalooza.\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't think that's it.\nRarity: I... suppose... it's possible it could have something to do with... [coughs] Gabby not wanting to spend time with him anymore.\nTwilight Sparkle: What? I thought the two of them were hanging out all the time.\nRarity: They were! Honestly, it took everything I had to convince him to spend any time with me at all! But between crystal gem crevasses, Power Pony conventions, and a marathon game of O&O, I managed to get some time in.\nTwilight Sparkle: It sounds like you made sure he didn't have any time to spend with Gabby at all.\nRarity: What?! Pfft! I most certainly did not!\n[beat]\nRarity: Well, I... suppose I may have monopolized him a teeny bit. [sighs] I'd just grown so used to having Spikey-Wikey around, I wasn't prepared for how much I'd miss him when he wasn't.\nTwilight Sparkle: Friendships change, but just because Spike made a new friend doesn't mean he stops being yours.\nRarity: I know, but now I have to share him! Which I suppose I'll have to get used to. [gasps] Right after I fix the mess I've made!\nTwilight Sparkle: Good talk.\n\nGabby: [sighs]\n[door opens]\n[music playing]\nGabby: Rarity? Is all this stuff for Spike again? Wouldn't it be easier to just give it to him? And why are you even here?\nRarity: I am here to apologize. Actually, more to confess. And all of this stuff isn't for Spike. It's the evidence against me!\nGabby: Evidence? For what?\nRarity: For my acts of utter selfishness!\nGabby: I don't understand.\nRarity: These are items I used to lure Spike into spending as much time with me as possible!\nGabby: They are? You did?\nSpike: Rarity? What are you doing?\nRarity: Well, obviously I'm apologizing to Gabby so the two of you can renew your friendship, Spike. Now please, even if you can't forgive me, you simply must forgive\u2014 [gasps] Spike?! Oh. I actually owe you an apology, too.\nGabby: You apologize a lot.\nRarity: I wish I didn't need to, but the more time you two spent together, the more I missed my time with Spike, and the more I used every means at my disposal to get it back. I am truly sorry.\nSpike: You really miss spending time with me?\nRarity: Oh, of course!\nGabby: I have to say, after not hanging out with you, I understand why. You're kinda awesome! And I know what it's like to miss that now, too.\nSpike: So, do you think maybe we could start hanging out again?\nGabby: Absolutely.\nSpike: I don't suppose you'd like some company on your rounds right now?\nGabby: I sure would!\nRarity: Wonderful! I can't tell you how pleased I am that the two of you have\u2014 [laughs] ...reconciled.\n\n[pickaxe clinking]\nRarity: [whispering] I suppose Twilight is right. Friendships do change.\n[gem shattering]\n[bats squeaking]\nRarity: [whispering] Of course Spike and I will always be friends, and I can get used to sharing him.\nPinkie Pie: [panicked yelping, whispering] Sorry! I just didn't want to drop another one and wake the bats.\nRarity: [whispering] Darling. Catching the gems is what the basket is for.\nSpike: [whispering] Wow. You two need to be a lot quieter.\nRarity: Spike! How wonderful to see you!\nSpike: Yeah. Gabby and I had a great day, but I'll always still want my Rarity time.\n[pickaxe clinking]\n[gem shattering]\nPinkie Pie: Ohhhh! So that's how it works!\n[wings flapping]\nPinkie Pie, Rarity, and Spike: [scream]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nStarlight Glimmer: I think you really spruce up the office, Ms. Philodendron. [gasps] Oh! I'm gonna call you Phyllis! [baby talk] Don't you look good, Phyllis!\n[knock on door]\nStarlight Glimmer: [baby talk] Come in!\n[door opens]\nStarlight Glimmer: [clears throat] I mean, uh, come in!\nSpike: Uh, were you just talking to someone?\nStarlight Glimmer: No! Why? [nervous laugh]\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight, I have something very important to discuss with you.\nStarlight Glimmer: If this is about leaving early yesterday, I didn't have any students on my schedule, and Trixie was having a magical emergency, which actually turned out to be nothing\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: [giggles] It's not anything like that.\nSpike: [clears throat, reading] \"Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship, in light of her impending ascension to the throne of Equestria and in anticipation of her many duties and responsibilities forthwith, does hereby intend to make good on her previous offer to you, Starlight Glimmer, of replacing her as headmare of the School of Friendship!\"\nTwilight Sparkle: I want you to take over the school when I move to Canterlot.\nStarlight Glimmer: I know! It's just so... amazing! I'm a little... Do you think I'm really up for it? Of course you do. I've covered for you every time you've had to run off and save Equestria, but... I mean... Yes. Of course! Thank you! [squeals]\n[thud]\nTwilight Sparkle: [straining] You're welcome. And I can't think of anypony who'd be better for the job.\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm a little nervous. And excited. I'm mostly just nervous.\nTwilight Sparkle: I understand. Of course I'll have a lot of important responsibilities as ruler of Equestria, but I'll always be available to help whenever you need.\nSpike: [gags, belches]\n[poof!]\nSpike: Are you supposed to be at a royal etiquette lesson with Celestia and Luna right now?\nTwilight Sparkle: Right! [sighs] Can't underestimate the important responsibility of royal napkin placement.\n[teleportation zap]\nStarlight Glimmer: Wow. I mean, no biggie. Right, Phyllis? I've totally got this.\n[shatter!]\nStarlight Glimmer: [nervous laugh]\n\n[theme song]\n\nTrixie: You know I'm nothing but proud that you've been officially offered the position of headmare...\nStarlight Glimmer: Thanks...?\nTrixie: ...but I can't help wondering if it's gonna cut into our social schedule.\nStarlight Glimmer: What do you mean?\nTrixie: Take now, for example. Instead of heading to the delightful lunch I had planned, we're striding with determination toward what I can only assume is Twilight's office.\nStarlight Glimmer: Obviously our lunch is super important, but so is taking over the school. And the only pony who's really run the School of Friendship is the Princess of Friendship. And I'm worried about doing it all alone, so I want to get as much advice from Twilight as I can while she's still here.\nTrixie: But Twilight's never really done anything alone. She always has her friends.\nStarlight Glimmer: But that just gave me an idea! Thanks, Trixie! You can give good advice when you don't mean to.\nTrixie: Uh, thanks? Are we still doing lunch?\n\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: Getting royal place settings just right is a lot harder than it looks.\nStarlight Glimmer: Okay... Uh, I know how busy you are, but I wanted to talk to you about running the school because, honestly, I was a bit worried about taking it over all on my own. But I just realized you never did it alone.\nTwilight Sparkle: Having a friend help out is pretty great.\n[magic humming]\nStarlight Glimmer: Exactly! So, what do you think about me hiring a vice headmare to help run things?\nTwilight Sparkle: I trust you to run the school any way you want. And if that means hiring a vice headmare, I think it's a great idea.\nStarlight Glimmer: Really?\nTwilight Sparkle: Like you said, I've always had ponies around to help. And don't worry. You can always call on me to\u2014\nSpike: Uh, Twilight? Rarity says you were supposed to be at the boutique five minutes ago for your second fitting for the coronation gown.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ugh. How many fittings are there gonna be?\nSpike: A lot?\nTwilight Sparkle: Anyway, good luck finding your vice headmare. I know you'll pick the right pony for the job.\n[teleportation zap]\nTrixie: Wow. I heard the whole thing. And all I can say is I am humbled.\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, why?\nTrixie: I hadn't ever considered it, but hearing you say it out loud made me realize what a great and powerful vice headmare I'll be! Plus, we get to work and socialize at the same time!\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, well, sure, that would be fun, but I can't just give you the job.\nTrixie: Oh, oh, no, of course not. I imagine there's a lengthy \"process\" to go through before you inevitably hire the \"best pony\" for the position. Wink.\nStarlight Glimmer: Exactly. I'll probably interview several ponies.\nTrixie: Of course. \"Several\". Wink.\nStarlight Glimmer: Why do you keep saying \"wink\"?\nTrixie: I'm not saying \"wink\". Wink.\nStarlight Glimmer: [nervous laugh]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm glad you all decided to be a part of the search for the School of Friendship's vice headmare.\nSpoiled Rich: Honestly, if you're looking for somepony to fund-raise, I can bring in enough bits to have several buildings named after me.\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, that's not the primary responsibility of the vice headmare. But anypony is welcome to apply. I think the selection process I've come up with is pretty special.\nTrixie: [whispering] Albeit unnecessary. Wink!\nStarlight Glimmer: [clears throat] Since you all have to prove you have what it takes to be vice headmare, I've designed the interview in three stages. Each stage will test a different skill the vice headmare needs. Only those who do well will move through the stages until finally the best candidate rises to the top! So, without further ado, it's time for stage one \u2013 substituting for the teachers!\nAll but Starlight Glimmer: [excited murmuring]\nTrixie: Once the students get a sample of my great and powerful instruction, they might not want to go back to the regular faculty.\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans]\n\nOcellus: Wow, that seam is so straight! You really learned how to sew from mending apple sacks on the farm?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\n\nSpoiled Rich: Obviously, loyalty is the foundation of friendship and trust. But nothing gets more loyalty than a big stack of bits! This book on business will teach you all how to earn your own. Chapter one \u2013 Equity...\n\n[instruments playing]\n[students laughing]\n[yovidaphone blaring]\n[bass guitar sounds]\n[students laughing]\n\n[bubbling]\n[balloon inflating]\n[fan whirring]\n[snip!]\n[drip!]\n[sounds of awe, cheering]\n\nTrixie: In the Pre-Equestia Era, year thirteen twenty-two, Abraxius the Bold did... [muttering] ...ooh, a bunch of boring stuff... [muttering] ...for a really long time. Okay, I know history is important, but I never learned any of it, and look how I turned out.\n[students groaning, yawning]\nGallus: [snoring]\n\n[students snoring]\nTrixie: [whispering] Wink! [snoring]\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: Okay, Phyllis. Obviously those three are moving on. But what about the rest? Mm-hmm. I think we're in agreement on this one. [sighs] I know what you're gonna say. But it would be so much fun to have my vice headmare be a friend. She just needs a little more hoof-holding than some of the others, but it could still work out, right?\n[door opens]\nTrixie: Starlight, I've given this a lot of thought. And even though I still believe naps are a valid use of class time, you'll be the one running the school. So if you say no naps, then no naps! And I know I can be a little stubborn and not the best listener, but I just can't wait for us to tackle this job as a team. Two great and powerful friends taking on the world! And I know you still have to go through all this \"interview\" stuff \u2013 wink! \u2013 but I just had to tell you how excited I am!\n[door closes]\nStarlight Glimmer: See? I told you it could work. [groans]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: All right, remaining vice headmare candidates. Welcome to stage two! All of you are here because you performed well \u2013 or well enough \u2013 to face your next challenge \u2013 parent/teacher conferences! The vice headmare will need to be a master communicator, and I can't think of a better test of that than meeting with our students and their parents or guardians.\nDr. Hooves: I eagerly look forward to sharing my love of science with both progeny and progenitors!\nOctavia Melody: Indeed. An orchestra is made up of different parts, and good communication is the key to harmony.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nTrixie: A lifetime on stage has taught me that good communication is essential to holding your audience's attention, which is why Trixie is also known as a great and powerful communicator!\n\nOctavia Melody: Life at the School of Friendship is like a song, and although she started out singing her part pianissimo, Ocellus is now soloing fortissimo!\nDad Changeling: That's good, right?\nOctavia Melody: [nervous laugh] Indeed.\nDr. Hooves: The science curriculum at this school is somewhat lacking, but Yona has taken to the subject like a yak to smashing! If fostered, I believe she could easily blaze a trail and expand our understanding of science itself!\nYona's Mom and Yona's Dad: Yaks best! Yaks best! Yaks best!\nTrixie: Gallus is a fantastic student. He's even taught me a thing or two about napping.\nGrampa Gruff: [yawns] Is that why you're putting me to sleep?\nTrixie: Um, excuse me?\nGrampa Gruff: I don't know why I have to come to these things.\nTrixie: Well, most parents or guardians want to be involved in our students' lives. Maybe we should find a different representative from Griffonstone to be Gallus' guardian.\nGrampa Gruff: Oh, that'd be great. If you find one, [echoing] let me know!\nSky Beak: I'm so confused. You're saying Silverstream is exuberant?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nSky Beak: And enthusiastic?\nBig McIntosh: Uh, eeyup.\nSky Beak: But aren't those the same? And are they good? I mean, you could be trying to tell me she's unfocused, but then you might just be explaining that you appreciate her high energy.\nBig McIntosh: Eh, nope. Uh, eeyup. Uh... mmmaybe?\nSky Beak: There seems to be a lot of nuance here, and I just want to make sure I understand exactly what you're saying. So what are you saying?\nBig McIntosh: Uh...\nGrampa Gruff: Gallus doesn't need to know I'm proud of him! And he certainly doesn't need me trekking all the way to Ponyville!\nTrixie: Good! Because you're no longer welcome!\nGrampa Gruff: Ohhhh! Well, fine with me!\nStarlight Glimmer: Trixie, what happened?!\nTrixie: I'm not sure. But we'll have one less conference to worry about next semester.\n[smack!]\n\nStarlight Glimmer: I really appreciate your honesty, Big Mac, and you're right. Parents expect a lot of detailed communication when it comes to their kids. And if you aren't comfortable with that, vice headmare probably isn't the job for you.\nBig McIntosh: Yeah, nope.\n[door opens]\nTrixie: Starlight, I know why you wanted to see me, and you don't have to worry.\nStarlight Glimmer: Uh, good.\nTrixie: It's thoughtful that you'd want to check in on me after my shocking confrontation with Grampa Gruff. But never fear. I shall recover.\nStarlight Glimmer: Trixie, that's not exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. You can't get into a shouting match with parents or guardians. For the final stage of the interview process, you'll each have to put together a field trip. And if you really do want the job, I need yours to be exceptional. Because if I had to pick a vice headmare right now, it wouldn't be you.\nTrixie: Oh, I see what you're doing! Obviously you're not going to give the job to somepony else, but you want to see my best. Well, message received! Wink.\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans] Trixie, I\u2014\nTrixie: The Great and Powerful Trixie is about to pull out all the stops! I hope you're ready for the most exceptional field trip to ever grace this school!\n[poof!]\nStarlight Glimmer: Is it wrong for me to think she might actually pull it off?\n[beat]\nStarlight Glimmer: [groans] Don't answer that.\n\nGallus: [yawns]\nStarlight Glimmer: Not looking forward to the performance?\nGallus: I know Octavia loves music, but a field trip to a classical music performance isn't my idea of an exciting time.\n[dubstep cello]\n[ponies cheering]\nGallus: Okay! I take it back!\n\nDr. Hooves: When I heard we'd be arranging field trips, I knew right away I wanted to take you all to my lab. I can think of no better trip than one through the quantum field! I am referring to time travel! I've been working on a temporal transportation device!\nSmolder: A chair?\nDr. Hooves: And three... four... five... Congratulations! You are now five seconds into the future! You see, we are all already time travelers! Hmm? Who's next?\n[beat]\nSmolder: Uhhh, now what?\nDr. Hooves: Oh. I actually hadn't thought that much beyond this.\nSmolder: Ugh.\n\n[poof!]\nTrixie: [coughs, clears throat] Ponies and other students! Welcome to the greatest and most powerful field trip of your lives!\nYona: Where Yona and friends going?\nTrixie: I am thrilled you asked. Because today we're not doing a normal, old, boring field trip where you go somewhere.\nYona: So... not field trip.\nTrixie: Au contraire. I could have easily taken you to Froggy Bottom Bogg. But we don't need to leave the comfort of the classroom for our field trip. I can bring the field trip to us!\n[teleportation zap]\n[crash!]\n[students gasp]\n[crack!]\n[electric sounds]\n[flash bees buzzing]\nStarlight Glimmer: Trixie, what did you do?!\nTrixie: Well, I found the perfect little patch of bog to teleport into the school. I guess I just didn't consider the possibility that a hive of flash bees might have nested there.\n[zap!]\n\n[flash bees buzzing]\n[students yelling]\nTrixie: [yelping] Who told you bees to nest in my patch of field trip bog?!\n[poofing]\n[electric sounds]\n[students yelling]\nStarlight Glimmer: Trixie, go with the students! I'll handle this!\nTrixie: I was only trying to give them an exceptional field trip experience! Which you have to admit I did.\n[flash bees buzzing]\nStarlight Glimmer and Trixie: Aah!\nStarlight Glimmer: We'll talk about it later!\n[magic sounds]\n[boom!]\nTrixie: Um, Starlight?\n[clattering]\nTrixie: Hey, there. So, um, they're gone?\nStarlight Glimmer: [bitterly] Yes.\nTrixie: Nice! Teamwork, am I right?\nStarlight Glimmer: Are you kidding? I don't know what team you're on, but it isn't mine. This was a disaster. It was dangerous.\nTrixie: I think the words you're looking for are \"great and powerful\".\nStarlight Glimmer: It wasn't even acceptable! You went from not taking it seriously to blowing things so out of proportion you put everycreature in danger! And I wanted to work with a friend so much, I ignored the fact that you would never be right for the job!\nTrixie: I'm confused. What are you saying?\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm saying you'll never be vice headmare!\nTrixie: But... But I thought you created the position for me.\nStarlight Glimmer: Why would you think that?! I created the position because I need help! But I can't think of any way that you would ever help me!\nTrixie: Twilight's friends always helped her.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh-ho. That's because Twilight's friends are competent! They care about what they are doing! And they know how to do it!\nTrixie: Well, I guess I won't take up any more of your time, Headmare Starlight.\n[thud]\nTwilight Sparkle: Starlight? I just thought I'd check in to see how the search for a vice headmare was going.\n[magic sounds]\nStarlight Glimmer: A lot better now.\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay...\nStarlight Glimmer: I really wanted it to be a friend, so I ended up pushing aside some pretty big signs that it wasn't gonna work out.\nTwilight Sparkle: Not everypony is right for every job, but everypony has something to contribute. The trick is figuring out what.\nStarlight Glimmer: What if you and your friend can't figure it out?\nTwilight Sparkle: If you have a job to do, you have to decide what's best and be upfront and honest, even if that means you can't work with a friend on it.\nStarlight Glimmer: So, I guess that means talking to them at the beginning instead of stringing them along until you get so frustrated you totally lose it and say a bunch of really awful things?\nTwilight Sparkle: Pretty much.\nStarlight Glimmer: [sighs]\n\n[knock on door]\nStarlight Glimmer: Trixie? I know you're in there.\nTrixie: Well, you're wrong!\n[clatter!]\nTrixie: [coughing]\nStarlight Glimmer: I'm sorry for all those things I said. I just really wanted it to work out, even though I knew it probably wouldn't. I should have said something sooner.\nTrixie: Obviously we can't have what we want, because I'm terrible at everything and could never help you with anything!\nStarlight Glimmer: You aren't terrible. And you have a lot of great qualities. Maybe not vice headmare qualities, but great and powerful friend qualities.\n[door opens]\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, you really stand by the ponies you care about. Gallus even said nocreature's ever stuck up for him the way you did with Grampa Gruff. It would have been nice to run the school together, but not everypony is right for every job.\nTrixie: I know how you take your responsibilities seriously. And maybe I should've known I wasn't exactly a perfect fit.\nStarlight Glimmer: If it makes you feel any better, nopony was.\nTrixie: What do you mean?\nStarlight Glimmer: Well, Dr. Hooves has decided to go back to his experiments, and Octavia is worried the responsibilities of vice headmare will take too much time away from her music. Maybe getting a vice headmare was a bad idea.\nTrixie: Starlight, obviously you'd like some help, and hiring a vice headmare is a great idea.\nStarlight Glimmer: But who could it be?\nTrixie: Well, you need somepony who's responsible like you and detail-oriented like Twilight. And... smart, obviously. It is a school after all.\nStarlight Glimmer: It would be nice if I got along with them, since having it be a friend can't work out.\nTrixie: Maybe it can.\n[poof!]\n\nSunburst: ...And I knew as soon as I read Trixie's scroll that it was the exact right thing for me to do.\nStarlight Glimmer: But what about being Flurry Heart's Crystaller?\nSunburst: Well, honestly, now that Flurry Heart's a little older, there really isn't much for me to do outside of the occasional tradition or festival. And working at a school is what I always thought I'd do. I mean, if you'll have me.\nStarlight Glimmer: Are you kidding?! You're hired!\nTrixie: I had a feeling this would work out.\nStarlight Glimmer: Oh, Trixie, thank you so much.\nTrixie: Between being insightful when I want to be and giving good advice when I don't mean to, I suppose I can be a pretty good friend.\nStarlight Glimmer: More than that, actually. You really did give good advice. And you helped me talk through the problem of finding the right pony for the job. And we know you care about the students.\nTrixie: Trixie the Great and Powerful Advice Giver, Problem Talk-Through-er, and Student Care-About-er! Eh, I think I'll go with \"friend\".\nStarlight Glimmer: \"Friend\" is perfect. But there's a position here at the school you might be right for, too. What would you say to being the School of Friendship's new student counselor?\nTrixie: I'd say this office needs a bit of redecorating. Potted plants scream desperation.\n[thud]\nStarlight Glimmer: Phyllis, no!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[knock on door]\n[door opens]\nFluttershy: Oh! I just stopped by to thank you for letting me borrow your Daring Do books. I love them!\nRainbow Dash: Wait 'til you get to Daring Do and the Riddle of the Sphinx!\nFluttershy: This is actually my second time through! I read them all! From Daring Do and the Sapphire Statue to Daring Do and the Fallen Idol!\nRainbow Dash: Fallen Idol? That's not in the series.\nFluttershy: Oh. It just came out last week. Maybe that's why you haven't heard of it?\nRainbow Dash: No way Daring Do's biggest fan \u2013 me \u2013 would miss a book coming out! Besides, A. K. Yearling always sends me a copy.\nFluttershy: Well, I'm happy to let you borrow mine until yours arrives.\nRainbow Dash: [reading] \"The true story of the thieving fraud known as Daring Do\"?! What?! Why would A. K. Yearling write that about herself?!\nFluttershy: Oh. It looks like she didn't. This book says it's by Groom Q. Q. Martingale.\nRainbow Dash: Who?\nFluttershy: I guess he's a new writer.\nRainbow Dash: A bad one. [reading] \"The only thing worse than Daring Do's destruction of temples is her cruelty to the mild-mannered Dr. Caballeron\"?!\nFluttershy: It was written from his point of view. I figured it was an artistic choice.\nRainbow Dash: More like a disaster! Listen! [reading] \"Daring Do isn't just a fictional character from over-the-top adventure stories. I've met her, and she is a real, live pony!\" That's supposed to be a secret! [grunts] We're the only ones who know Daring Do is really A. K. Yearling in disguise. But if other ponies read this book, how long will it take them to figure that out?! We have to go warn her! Fluttershy!\nFluttershy: Hm? Oh. Sorry.\n\n[theme song]\n\nRainbow Dash: A. K. Yearling is signing all her books at the bookstore today. We can warn her about what's going on.\nFluttershy: Don't you think you should read Martingale's book first? Just to hear both sides of the story?\nRainbow Dash: Uh, why? The only true thing in that pack of lies is that Daring Do is real.\nFluttershy: There's also a lot of insight into Dr. Caballeron's life choices. Did you know he's actually a history professor and amateur bird watcher?\nRainbow Dash: Are you serious right now? A random writer trashes our friend and exposes her secret, and you want to talk about birds?!\nFluttershy: [whispers] Also spider cruelty.\nRainbow Dash: What?!\nFluttershy: You have to admit Daring Do wrecks a lot of spider webs in her adventures.\nRainbow Dash: In order to save precious artifacts from the bad guy, who you seem to have forgotten is Dr. Caballeron! Are you sure you read the same series I did?\n\n[door opens]\nRainbow Dash: Well, at least A. K. Yearling's true fans know Martingale's book is bogus.\nFluttershy: I'm not sure those are all fans.\n[slam!]\nPony 1: Why didn't your books say Daring Do was real? This changes everything!\nPony 2: And why do you only write about her good side? Is she bribing you?\nPony 1: On page five-thirty-one, it says that Daring Do kicks puppies!\n\"Peach Fuzz\": She does?!\nA. K. Yearling: What?! No! Look, are any of you here for my actual book signing?\n[ponies muttering negatively]\nPony 2: Uh-uh. Frankly, I don't even know how you can call it fiction if it's all real. [scoffs] You're as much a fake as Daring Do!\n[ponies agreeing]\nRainbow Dash: I... guess we're a little late to warn you about the new book, huh?\nA. K. Yearling: [sighs] I always feared that someday everypony would learn Daring Do was real.\nFluttershy: But why? Aren't you proud of your adventures?\nA. K. Yearling: Of course, but I'm not in it for the fame. The stories just seemed too good to keep to myself. I wish I knew who this Martingale author was and why he's determined to ruin my character. And me.\nFluttershy: Maybe we can ask him.\nRainbow Dash: No way! He's doing a signing across the street?!\nA. K. Yearling: You'd better go without me. I can't risk the chance Martingale might recognize me as Daring Do.\n\n[indistinct chatter]\nFluttershy: Oops. Um, sorry. E-Excuse us.\nRainbow Dash: [gasps] That's not Martingale! It's Dr. Caballeron in disguise! Now it all makes sense! Daring Do's archnemesis created a fake author self so he can write books that make him sound like a hero! Who does that?!\nFluttershy: Uh, A. K. Yearling?\nRainbow Dash: This is totally different. [to Dr. Caballeron] Well, well, well! Up to your old tricks again, huh? Just like in Somnambula! Spreading lies to make Daring Do look bad!\nFluttershy: Would you sign our book?\nGroom Q. Q. Martingale: I am just a simple author telling it like it is. Who should I make it out to?\nFluttershy: Fluttershy. With two \"T\"'s.\nRainbow Dash: [groans] We know who you really are! And unless you want us to tell all of them, you'd better answer some questions!\nGroom Q. Q. Martingale: I'm afraid that's all we have time for today. [chuckles]\nPonies: Awwww...\nGroom Q. Q. Martingale: But please take a free copy of my book on your way out.\nPonies: [cheering]\nRainbow Dash: We aren't gonna let you get away with this, Caballeron!\nGroom Q. Q. Martingale: Get away with what? I am merely telling my side of the story.\nRainbow Dash: You mean lying!\nGroom Q. Q. Martingale: You think everything in A. K. Yearling's books are true? In Daring Do and the Quetzal's Quest, she states that the Fangthorn Flowers are red when in fact they are blue!\nFluttershy: It's true. They are.\nRainbow Dash: [scoffs] That sounds like more of an editor's mistake.\nGroom Q. Q. Martingale: Still, if that is wrong, is it not possible that other, bigger things are, too? Take a look. It's in my book.\nRainbow Dash: But I don't have to take your word for it! C'mon, Fluttershy!\nGroom Q. Q. Martingale: [sighs dramatically]\nFluttershy: Is something wrong?\nGroom Q. Q. Martingale: It is terrible being misunderstood. It is true in the past I have not been as nice to Daring Do as I should. But I have my reasons!\nFluttershy: Want to talk about what happened?\nGroom Q. Q. Martingale: My team and I were only ever interested in researching artifacts and taking them to our museum where...\n\nGroom Q. Q. Martingale: [narrating] ...other ponies could study them. But Daring Do always seemed to get there first with her own plans. I offered to team up with her, but she refused. She had her own ideas of where the treasures belonged.\n\nFluttershy: Daring Do did have a lot of artifacts on her shelves at home. But didn't you try to sell them to the highest bidder?\nGroom Q. Q. Martingale: Only because I had to.\n\nGroom Q. Q. Martingale: [narrating] Since Daring Do kept taking our artifacts, our museum closed. We were desperate for money to keep it open.\nAhuizotl: [roars]\n\nFluttershy: She does destroy a lot of ancient sites. Not to mention the homes of the animals that live there.\nGroom Q. Q. Martingale: And I felt it was my duty to tell the world. Thank you for listening and understanding, Miss...\nFluttershy: Fluttershy. Two \"T\"'s.\nDr. Caballeron: And I am Dr. Caballeron. \"Martingale\" is merely a nom de plume to build my brand. You know, my team could use an insightful Pegasus like you, Fluttershy. Have you ever thought of being... an adventurer?\nFluttershy: Who, me?\n\n[door opens]\nRainbow Dash: Finally! What took you so long?\nFluttershy: I decided to find out which author is really telling the truth, so I joined Dr. C's Tenochtitlan expedition!\nRainbow Dash: Say whaaaaaaat?!\n\n\"Peach Fuzz\": So Daring Do doesn't kick puppies?\nA. K. Yearling: That was one time! Accidentally!\n[door opens]\nRainbow Dash: [panting] A. K.! You have to help me! Groom Q. Q. Martingale is really Dr. Caballeron, and he has Fluttershy! The book thing was his new plan to ruin Daring Do's reputation, and he's trying to make my friend a criminal! They're off to Tenochtitlan right now!\nA. K. Yearling: He must be after the Truth Talisman of Tonatiuh! It requires the wings of a Pegasus to retrieve it!\nRainbow Dash: That's gotta be why Caballeron tricked Fluttershy into joining his gang!\nA. K. Yearling: Then it's up to us to stop him!\n[cloak flaps]\n\"Peach Fuzz\": Whooooaaaa!\n\n[crunch]\nDr. Caballeron: Watch where you put your hooves, everypony. We do not want to disturb the fragile jungle ecosystem.\nFluttershy: Oh, that's so thoughtful.\nDr. Caballeron: Yes, unlike Daring Do, who slashes plants aside with her cruel machete.\nFluttershy: Thank you.\n[crunch!]\nDr. Caballeron: Fool! Don't you know that's poison?!\n[beat]\nDr. Caballeron: I... don't want you to get hurt, my friend. [nervous chuckle]\nRogue: But I'm hungry.\nFluttershy: Oh! I can help with that! Here!\nDr. Caballeron: You are... willing to share?\nFluttershy: Of course! That's part of the fun of having an adventure with friends!\n[munching and sipping]\n[bushes rustle]\n[jaguar roars]\n[lynx yowls]\n[cheetah growls]\nFluttershy, Dr. Caballeron, and henchponies: [gasp]\n[white cat yowls]\n[screech!]\nDr. Caballeron: Fluttershy! Run! These ferocious beasts want to eat us for dinner!\nFluttershy: That's a common misconception. Have you ever tried just talking to them?\nDr. Caballeron: That's crazy! You are on your own!\nWithers: She's a goner.\nBiff: I can't watch!\n[jungle cats purring]\nFluttershy: We're very sorry for coming into your territory. We're just passing through.\nDr. Caballeron: How did you do that?\nFluttershy: Everycreature likes to be listened to. You just need to take the time to understand them.\nDr. Caballeron: You are more talented than I realized.\nFluttershy: Thanks. I'm having the best time with you all!\n\nRainbow Dash: Fluttershy must be having the worst time with Caballeron's goons!\nDaring Do: We need to catch up to them before they reach the Truth Talisman!\nRainbow Dash: Why? What's so special about it?\nDaring Do: It has the power to make the pony holding it tell the truth. But Caballeron only wants it because it's made of solid gold. He'll melt it down and use it to get rich.\nRainbow Dash: So if this Talisman is so important, why didn't you already save it? You said only a Pegasus can get it, right?\nDaring Do: Yes, but the temple traps are far too dangerous to face without a map. And maybe even with one.\nRainbow Dash: [gulps]\n\nBiff: Boss, how about we take the shortcut?\nDr. Caballeron: How about you be quiet?!\n[beat]\nDr. Caballeron: I-I mean... no, thank you, Biff. Let's just follow the map.\nBiff: Aww. I'm supposed to be Dr. C's second-in-command. But he never listens to me.\nFluttershy: Well, keep trying. I believe in you.\nDr. Caballeron: At last! Now we simply have to wait for the sun to reach its highest point, and our path will be revealed.\n[fly-ders buzzing]\nFluttershy: Withers. Don't. Move.\n[zip!]\n[flute sounds]\nWithers: [cheers]\n\nDaring Do: There they are! We can catch them before they enter the temple!\n[vines snap]\nDaring Do: [yelps]\nRainbow Dash: [gasps]\nDaring Do: Get back, Rainbow Dash! It's Ahuizotl!\n[vines snap]\nRainbow Dash: [grunts]\nAhuizotl: [laughs evilly] Daring Do, my old nemesis. You may have outsmarted my jungle cats, but you cannot escape me!\nRainbow Dash: [grunts] We didn't see any cats! We're just here to rescue Fluttershy!\nAhuizotl: Hmmm... It must be a coincidence that only a Pegasus can retrieve Tonatiuh's treasure, and there are two of you here.\n[slam!]\n[zip!]\nAhuizotl: [roars]\n\n[grinding]\n[magic sounds]\n[rumbling]\nDr. Caballeron: Quickly! Before the sun moves and it closes!\n[rumbling]\n[thud]\nRainbow Dash: Phew! That was cutting it close.\nDaring Do: And without a map, we'll have to guess which way to go.\n\n[rumbling]\n[shimmering]\nDr. Caballeron: [overdramatically] Oh, no! I knew the Truth Talisman could not be moved by magic, but I never realized we'd have to fly to retrieve it! Our journey has been for nothing!\nFluttershy: Don't be upset. I can get it.\nDr. Caballeron: Oh, Fluttershy, you are too kind. But I could never ask that of you. It might be dangerous!\nFluttershy: I want to do it! For all of you, my new friends. And to protect a historical treasure!\n[rumbling]\nFluttershy: [screaming] Whoa!\nBiff: [grunts] Give me a hoof here!\nWithers: [grunting]\n[cracking]\n[thud!]\nFluttershy: [yelping] Aah!\n[lava bubbling]\n[rumbling]\nWithers: We did it!\nRogue: You're safe!\nFluttershy: Thanks, everypony.\nDaring Do: Give us the Talisman, Caballeron!\nRainbow Dash: We're not taking  no for an answer!\nFluttershy: Wait! You don't understand! My friends are researchers! They only want to study the Talisman and keep it safe in a museum! Right, Dr. C?\nDr. Caballeron: Uhhh... no.\nFluttershy: [gasps] But... But you said\u2014\nDaring Do: Now that he's holding Tonatiuh's Talisman, he has to tell the truth!\nRainbow Dash: Admit it, Caballeron! You're only pretending to like Fluttershy because she has the wings you needed to steal the Truth Talisman! Isn't that right?!\nDr. Caballeron: No! I admit that was the original reason, but my henchponies and I have come to value your friendship and kindness.\n[beat]\nRainbow Dash: Didn't see that coming.\n[rumbling]\nAhuizotl: [growls]\nRainbow Dash: Or that!\nAhuizotl: More intruders? And you dare to steal Tonatiuh's Talisman?! Guardian-goyles, attack!\n[shimmering]\n[guardian-goyles growl]\nAhuizotl: [laughs evilly]\n[thud!]\n[guardian-goyle roars]\n\n[guardian-goyles growling]\nDr. Caballeron: Fluttershy! Can't you ask them to stop like the jungle cats?\nFluttershy: Um, excuse me? Uh, guardian-goyles?\n[guardian-goyle growls]\nDaring Do: It's no good! They're only stone and magic, not alive! I encountered some like this in Marapore!\nDr. Caballeron: Ah, yes. I seem to recall similar creations in Flankladesh.\nRainbow Dash: So? How do you get rid of them?!\n[chomp!]\nDaring Do: I know they don't like bright light!\nFluttershy: There's none of that in here.\nDaring Do: Not yet! Caballeron! Do you still have the Diamond of Lapis Lux?\nDr. Caballeron: Yes! I-I mean... [straining] Yes! I-I mean\u2014! [growls] How did you know I stole it?!\nDaring Do: Lucky guess. Hold it high!\n[guardian-goyles growl]\n[cracking]\nFluttershy: Wow! You two make a great team!\nRainbow Dash: Yeah, I'm not sure how I feel about that.\nDaring Do: Feel later! Now it's time to escape!\n[thudding]\nBiff: If we want to get out of here, we're all gonna have to work together.\nDr. Caballeron: That's... actually a good idea.\nFluttershy: See? Told you he'd listen.\nDaring Do: A truce until we escape? How can we trust you?\nDr. Caballeron: I cannot lie. Now, all together!\nAll: [grunting]\n[thud!]\n\nAhuizotl: [humming] Aah! You again! [growls] If I wanted to play games, I would get out my pinochle deck!\nDaring Do: This way!\n[whooshing]\nDaring Do: Rainbow Dash!\nRainbow Dash: I'm gonna need the deluxe spa package after this adventure. That doesn't leave this temple!\nRogue: That's it! I'm quitting the henchpony business to finally follow my dreams of becoming an opera star!\n[beat]\nRogue: Uh... maybe you should hold this.\n[slam!]\nAhuizotl: You cannot hide in there forever! It's a dead end! [laughs evilly, grunting]\nDaring Do: Ahuizotl won't give up until he catches us.\nAhuizotl: [grunts]\nFluttershy: [gasps] I think our problem is the solution.\nRainbow Dash: Uh, did you forget there's a monster out there that wants to crush us?\nFluttershy: But why? Nopony ever asked Ahuizotl what his side of the story is. He must have a reason for being so upset.\nRainbow Dash: Or maybe he's just the bad guy! Do I need to remind you he's tried to squash Daring Do like a hundred times?!\n[slam!]\nDr. Caballeron: And me as well. I was so scared, I had to change my ascot. Aah! Curse this truth teller!\nFluttershy: Understanding begins with listening.\nAhuizotl: [growls] Prepared to meet your doom?\nFluttershy: Um, not really. Just here to ask \u2013 why are you chasing us, Mr. Ahuizotl?\nAhuizotl: Well... the thing is, I'm in charge of protecting this jungle. If another artifact goes missing on my watch, I'm going to be in so much trouble with the other guardian creatures.\nFluttershy: Awww. That sounds like a lot of responsibility.\nAhuizotl: [stammers] It is! And those two have taken so many relics from my land, my job is on the line! So... maybe I am a little violent and ferocious. Can you blame me? [blows nose]\nDaring Do: The only reason I've been taking the artifacts is because I thought I was protecting them.\nDr. Caballeron: I was stealing them to get rich. But I never realized you had a noble cause. I thought you were just being a monster.\nAhuizotl: [sighs] I get that a lot.\nRainbow Dash: Maybe there is something to this whole listening-to-everypony thing.\nFluttershy: It doesn't always mean they're telling the truth, but everycreature deserves kindness.\nAhuizotl: True. And because you returned the Talisman and took the time to understand me, I will let you all go.\n[rumbling]\nAhuizotl: On one condition! You swear to never steal artifacts from the Tenochtitlan Basin again!\nDaring Do and Dr. Caballeron: I promise.\nDaring Do: I'll even write that in my next book.\nDr. Caballeron: Your next book? You mean you're actually A. K. Yearling?\nDaring Do: Don't tell anypony!\nDr. Caballeron: That gives me an idea.\n\nRainbow Dash: Hey, what's going on? I thought your first co-written novel would bring out a ton of fans.\nA. K. Yearling: We've been upstaged by a new author.\n\nAhuizotl: And so, the noble Ahuizotl bravely toiled day and night to protect the jungle's precious artifacts...\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nApple Bloom: I can't believe we're goin' to the Appleloosa County Fair!\nSweetie Belle: Animal shows, carnival rides...\nScootaloo: And all kinds of food on a stick!

I promised to deliver a new design to Fancy Pants for his Monocle and Top Hat Appreciation Society soiree.\nSweetie Belle: Can't you finish it tomorrow?\n[smack!]\nRarity: Well, I could. But you'll learn as you get older how important it is to keep your promises, especially when running a business.\nSweetie Belle: Maybe we should just go by ourselves?\nRarity: What?! Oh, my dear, no! Appleloosa is far too long a train ride for young foals without accompaniment. You could end up in the wrong place entirely. Why don't you see if Rainbow Dash is free?\n\nRainbow Dash: Sorry, but I just heard from Spitfire that a whole bunch of storm clouds got loose from the cloud factory, and she needs every Wonderbolt to help bust 'em.\nScootaloo: Aw, come on, Rainbow Dash! They won't miss one pony! And we really want to go to the fair! Apparently we're too young to go alone.\nRainbow Dash: Well, duh. Young ponies like you could get lost and never find your way back. But I still can't go. Being a Wonderbolt isn't just about showing off. It's also a responsibility. You'll understand when you get older. I'm sure you'll find somepony else to take you.\n\nApplejack: I wish I could, sugarcube. But Big Mac's not feelin' well today.\nApple Bloom: Awww. But Big Mac's old enough to take care of himself, and we'd all have so much fun together.\nApplejack: Sometimes takin' care of somepony is more important than havin' fun. Speakin' of which, don't you even think about tryin' to go without a grown pony there to take care of you. You could end up in hot water or worse.\nApple Bloom: We know.\n\nScootaloo: The fair could be over before we find somepony to take us.\nApple Bloom: But then we thought of you, since the fair will be full of all sorts of animals and creatures.\nFluttershy: I'm sorry, but Twilight has an important magical research project, and she's asked for my help.\nSweetie Belle: I guess that means Twilight's busy, too?\n\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm afraid I am.

You could take the wrong train or miss your stop...\nFluttershy: Or get lost in a strange town and end up in a dangerous situation with nopony to help you.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: We know!\nTwilight Sparkle: I know it's hard, but sometimes you just can't do what you want.\nScootaloo: I'm pretty sure if you wanted to go to the fair, you could.\nTwilight Sparkle: Sure, grown-ups can do a lot of things that foals can't. But there's plenty we can't do either. Like right now, I can't find a single reference to this flower!\nFluttershy: None of the birds or insects I've talked to have heard of it either.\nTwilight Sparkle: I wonder if there's anything in Shadetail Evergreen's Tome of Flora and Fauna?\nFluttershy: That book's pretty out of date, but it might be worth a try.\nTwilight Sparkle: I think there's a copy in the library filed under \"Discontinued But Still Potentially Useful Ancient Texts\". Unless I put it under \"Hokum With a Slight Chance of Practical Applications\".\nApple Bloom: I guess this flower is the most interestin' thing we're gonna see today.\nScootaloo: Unless you count watching Twilight struggle to remember how she organizes her books.\nSweetie Belle: I bet every pony in Equestria is in Appleloosa right now.\nApple Bloom: Every pony but us.\nScootaloo: I wish we didn't have to wait to grow up.\n[magic sounds]\nApple Bloom: I wish it would happen all at once. Then we'd know everything we need to get to the fair and back with no problem.\n[louder magic sounds]\nSweetie Belle: I just wish we were as old as our sisters.

[to Apple Bloom and Scootaloo] Do you think we got on the wrong train?\nScootaloo: I thought trains just took you where you wanted to go.\n\"Loose Tracks\": [laughing]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [scream]\n\"Loose Tracks\": Sorry, I don't mean to laugh. But you three must not travel much. This is Hayseed Junction. The train to Appleloosa isn't for a few hours. Or you could set off on hoof. It's treacherous and confusing! Unfit for the young or timid! But you three are grown-ups. You'll be fine. I'll write down some directions.\nSweetie Belle: Maybe we should wait for the train.\nScootaloo: And miss the fair?!\nSweetie Belle: We already ended up in the wrong place, which is exactly what we were warned about. And what if we can't follow the directions?\nApple Bloom: Come on. We didn't come all this way for nothin'. Besides, I've been through a swamp as a young pony. As a grown-up, it'll be a snap.\nScootaloo: Grown-ups always know the way!\nSweetie Belle: Because being big is all it takes!\n\"Loose Tracks\": [laughs maniacally, hacks, inhales] Sorry.

We're just grown-ups.\nScootaloo: And we are definitely not lost.\nSpur: Okay. But that swamp is pretty confusing if you're not from around here. I'm Spur, and this is Biscuit.\n[rattling]\nApple Bloom: I'm Apple Bloom. Nice to meet you. But, uh, we're not confused. We're just... explorin' new ways to Appleloosa.\nBiscuit: Hey, that's where we're going!\nSpur: No, it isn't!\nSweetie Belle: Uh, which is it?\nSpur: Biscuit thinks he can just take Bloofy here to the fair.\nBiscuit: Why not? It's just up the road. And Bloofy's my pet, too.\nSpur: Since when?! Bloofy's never even seen a crowd! Which you'd know if you ever took care of him!\nBiscuit: Did you ever think meeting all those ponies might be good for him?\nBloofy: [chittering]\nApple Bloom: He seems okay meetin' us.\nBiscuit: See? They're grown-ups, and they get it. Bloofy should totally come to the fair with me, right?\nSpur: Y'all don't really think that, do ya?\nSweetie Belle: Um... Hold on. Us grown-ups need to confer. [to Apple Bloom and Scootaloo] What do you girls think?\nScootaloo: If they go to the fair, we can tag along!\nApple Bloom: And Spur probably should share Bloofy. I mean, that's somethin' a grown-up would say, right?\nSweetie Belle: As grown-up ponies, we think you should share Bloofy and let Biscuit take him to the fair.\nBiscuit: That is some quality grown-up advice!\nBloofy: [chittering]\nSpur: But Bloofy's never been around anything that exciting. What if something goes wrong?\nApple Bloom: We're headed to the fair, too. Since we're such great advice givers, feel free to ask us for more.\n\n[ponies chattering]\n[horseshoe clangs]\n[splash!]\n[ponies laughing]\nSweetie Belle: [laughs] It's everything I thought it'd be!\nBloofy: [squealing]\nPasserby Pony: Well, my goodness, what an interesting critter! You should enter him in the animal showcase. You'd be sure to win \"Most Interesting Creature\"!\nBiscuit: Animals showcase? That's exactly what we should do!\nSpur: That seems like a bad idea. What do you grown-ups think?\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [laugh]\n\n[thunk!]\n[bell rings]\n[ponies cheer]\nCutie Mark Crusaders: [laugh]\n\nSweetie Belle: Whoo-hoo! Whoo-whoo!\n\n[splat]\nSpur: What happened to being able to ask your advice?!

The showcase looks like fun.\nSpur: Sorry if I think taking care of Bloofy is more important than having fun!\nBloofy: [shrieking]\nBiscuit: Bloofy's just excited. He probably just wants to get out.\nBloofy: [chitters, sniffs]\nApple Bloom: Are you sure you're not just upset you have to share him? What if you took a little break?\nSpur: You mean, like, leave?\nSweetie Belle: If sharing him is too hard, that might be the best thing. Take our word for it. We are grown-ups.\nApple Bloom: I don't know what Spur's so worried about. Bloofy and Biscuit are havin' fun.\nScootaloo: Yeah. What could go wrong?\nBloofy: [chittering]\n[ponies cheering]\nBloofy: [squealing]\n[whooshing]\nScootaloo: Me and my big grown-up mouth.\n\n[ponies screaming]\n[whooshing]\nApple Bloom: Do you think this qualifies as gettin' into a dangerous situation with no grown pony to help us?\n[cow moos]\nSweetie Belle: I think we're the grown ponies that need to be helping today!\nScootaloo: Bloofy! Treats, treats, treats! Who wants a treat?\n[whooshing continues]\n[teleportation zap]\nBiscuit: What do we do now?!\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Run!\n\n[train whistle blows]\nFluttershy: I hope you're right about the girls coming here.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, once we read Shadetail Evergreen's warning that the flower grants wishes, it wasn't a stretch to think they wished themselves to the fair. It's all they were talking about.\nFluttershy: Or maybe, since we told them they were too young to come, they wished to become grown-ups, then came here and caused some kind of trouble that led to a town-wide panic!\n[distant screaming]\nTwilight Sparkle: Yeah. Or that.\nApple Bloom: Twilight! Fluttershy! Thank goodness! I know you're not gonna believe it, but it's me, Apple Bloom!\nScootaloo: And I'm Scootaloo! We kinda got turned into grown-ups!\nSweetie Belle: And we thought we could take the train here, since we were old enough, but we ended up in the wrong place, just like you said we would!\nApple Bloom: And got lost!\nScootaloo: Just like you said we would!\nApple Bloom: Then we met these foals who led us to the fair, and we tried to give them some grown-up-style advice, but it turned their pet into a tornado that might destroy the whole town!\n\n[whooshing]\nFluttershy: Goodness! A Whirling Mungtooth! They are very rare and just the cutest little things when they're not excited.\n[crash!]\nFluttershy: This one's excited.\nScootaloo: How do we calm him down?\nFluttershy: When they're young, a Mungtooth forms a tight bond with its caretaker. They're the only ones who can get them to stop spinning.\nBiscuit: Spur's the one who really took care of Bloofy. We have to find her!\nTwilight Sparkle: You all go look for Spur. Fluttershy and I will do our best to keep everypony here safe.\n[teleportation zap]\n[ewe bleats]\nSpur: That's Bloofy?!\n[teleportation zap]\nBiscuit: I'm so sorry, Spur. You knew what was best for him all along.\nApple Bloom: And even though we seem like grown-ups, you were way more responsible than us.\nSpur: What do you mean, \"seem\" like grown-ups?\nSweetie Belle: Uh, we don't have time to explain. Right now we have to stop this, and you're the only one who can do it.\nSpur: How?\nFluttershy: I'll show you. He mostly just needs to see you.\nSpur: Hey there, Bloofy-boo. It's okay.\n[whooshing stops]\nBloofy: [squeals, chitters]\nSpur: How did you know what to do?\nFluttershy: After years of experience with animals, I've picked up a few things.\n\nSpur: Well, one thing's for sure. Bloofy definitely earned the \"Most Interesting Creature\" prize.\nBiscuit: I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.\nApple Bloom: We all are.\nSpur: I guess grown-ups aren't always perfect.\nTwilight Sparkle: They sure aren't, but young foals pretending to be grown-ups are even less so.\nSpur: What do you mean?\nTwilight Sparkle: There's only one petal left. But I think the three of you know what to wish for. And I'm pretty sure Star Swirl won't mind.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: We wish we were foals again.\n[magic sounds]\nBiscuit: Hold on! You three are actually younger than us?!\nSweetie Belle: The flower turned us into grown-ups, so we figured we could do whatever we wanted. But I guess that's not exactly true.\nApple Bloom: We did everything real grown-ups told us not to and caused all kinds of trouble.\nScootaloo: And things could have been a lot worse. I guess we were pretty selfish.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm glad you learned something. That's what growing up is. Which is why you probably shouldn't skip any of it.\nSweetie Belle: I know we didn't make the best impression, but we sure would like to visit you and Bloofy some day.\nSpur: I guess that'd be okay, on one condition. You get a real grown-up to bring you.\nCutie Mark Crusaders: Deal!\nAll: [laughing]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nSpike: [sighs] I just wanted everything to be perfect.

That one has the invitation for him to come here.\nMrs. Cake: Oh, it's... it's no bother! I do love a challenge! Did I add the sugar to this one or to that one?\nScootaloo: I think I've seen her add sugar to that bowl six times so far.\nSugar Belle: Now you three go deliver that pie. I have to get some flowers to spruce the place up.\n[door opens]\nSugar Belle: [gasps]\n[door closes]\nSugar Belle: Uh-oh. Spike and Discord are outside. If they figure out what we're up to, they'll spill the beans!

Nope.\n[barn door opens]\nApple Bloom: Big Mac! He ain't here. Let's go.\nScootaloo: Hold on... That looks just like the shelf Big Mac made for Sugar Belle. Weird.\nSweetie Belle: Maybe we should wait here for him. He's bound to show up soon.\nApple Bloom: You know, When I'm lookin' for somethin', Granny says it's best to check the least likely place.

We still have time.\nApple Bloom: You know, when I'm lookin' for somepony, Granny says it's best to just stay in one place. Let's head back to the farm and wait.

I just had the most peculiar dream.\nScootaloo: That's nice, Granny, but we really need to find Big Mac, so\u2014\nGranny Smith: It was about Grand Pear. Only it wasn't. We were in outer space on some kinda mission to explore a strange new world.\nSweetie Belle: If we get stuck listening to Granny, we'll never find Big Mac.\nGranny Smith: And Mudbriar was there, bein' as logical as ever, but his ears was all pointy-like. And then Discord showed up and... well, you know, he was pretty much the same.\nApple Bloom: Once she gets goin', there's nothin' in Equestria that can stop her.\n[booming]\nScootaloo: You sure about that?\n[roaring]\n\nBig McIntosh: Spike?\nSpike: Aah!

That's what I was doing!\nDiscord: Who are you proposing to?\nApple Bloom: Discord!\nDiscord: Me?!\nGiant Apple: i love you! i love you! i love you!\nDiscord: [snaps]\n[poof!]\n[apples thudding]\nSpike: So the messages that were in the desserts...\nMrs. Cake: ...were Sugar Belle's proposal to Big Mac before Spike set them on fire!\nDiscord: Oh, so I'm not the only one who messes things up, am I, Mr. High-and-Mighty Dragon?\nSpike: Hey! Those desserts were ruined way before I ruined them!\nMrs. Cake: They were not! Well, I... may have mixed up a... a few ingredients. It was such a rush.\nDiscord: You should both be very disappointed in yourselves.\nScootaloo: What about you and your apple monster?!\nDiscord: Yes, but you all expect that of me.\nApple Bloom: All we wanted to do was make up for messin' things up the last time. Sugar Belle, Big Mac, we're really\u2014\nSweetie Belle: Where'd they go?\n[beat]\nDiscord: Okay, this time, it really wasn't me!\n\nMrs. Cake: I shouldn't have taken all those desserts at once. It's just, how can you say no to such a sweet idea? Oh! Ha! \"Sweet\"! [laughs] I made a joke.\n\nSpike: In retrospect, dragon flame and baked goods aren't the best combo.\n\nApple Bloom: We felt like it was all our fault.\nScootaloo: Except for the apple monster. That was Discord. And Mrs. Cake messing up those recipes. And Spike burning the messed-up recipes. And\u2014\nSweetie Belle: The point is we all felt bad for ruining Big Mac and Sugar Belle's proposals.\n\nGranny Smith: It was all green, and then Grand Pear looked at me all dramatical and says, \"Where nopony has gone before!\" And whoosh! Away we flew!\n\nSugar Belle: Today was... interesting.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nSugar Belle: You okay?\nBig McIntosh: I... I'm sorry, Sugar Belle. I wanted everything to go right today. I wanted our love to be as perfect as my parents' was when they planted these two trees together. Instead, it turned into a mess. Just like when I asked you out. Just like Hearts and Hooves Day. No matter how hard I try, I always seem to mess up when it comes to you.\nSugar Belle: I think you've got things backwards.\nBig McIntosh: What do you mean?\nSugar Belle: From everything you told me about your parents, they had to deal with things a lot tougher than some burnt desserts and an apple monster.\nBig McIntosh: I.... guess that's true.\nSugar Belle: This apple tree and pear tree are stronger together. They'll survive whatever comes because they don't have to do it alone. They belong together. Like your parents. And like us.\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup.\nSugar Belle: Today was a disaster. But today was also the last day we're ever gonna have to do anything apart. From here on out, we'll be together. And we'll make sure everything always works out just right.\n\n\n\n\nBig McIntosh:\nSugar Belle, will you\u2014? Sorry.\n\n\nSugar Belle:\nBig Mac, will you\u2014? No, I'm sorry.\n\n\nBig McIntosh:\nSugar Belle, will you\u2014? Sorry.\n\nSugar Belle:\nBig Mac, will you\u2014? No, I'm sorry.\n\nBig McIntosh: On three?\nSugar Belle: Sure. One...\nBig McIntosh: Two...\nBig McIntosh and Sugar Belle: Will you marry me? Eeyup! [kiss]\nSugar Belle: We'll have to thank our friends for messing up so bad that they made it all work out perfectly.\n[apple chitters]\nDiscord: Well, we've all made up, and we're here for a do-over. And this time, thanks to me, we've got it right. So, why don't you two... you know?\nSpike: Uh, I think they did okay without us.\n\nApple Bloom: And that's how we were responsible for the perfect proposal! [laughs] Or, should I say, \"pear-posal\".\nSweetie Belle: If we hadn't messed up so bad...\nScootaloo: ...it wouldn't have worked out the way it did!\nMrs. Cake: It's just like baking. Sometimes, it's the mistakes that help you discover something truly special.\nSpike: And when all the planning and grand gestures go wrong, it reminds you the most romantic things are usually the simplest.\nDiscord: Which is what I knew all along. You're welcome.\n[romantic music]\nMayor Mare: It is my sincere pleasure to say, for my second Apple family wedding, that I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride!\nAll: [cheering]\nDiscord: That's your cue!\nApples: [singing] Happy marriage, happy Apples! Happy marriage...\nSpike: Discord!\nDiscord: Oh, just let me have this one!\nApples: [singing] Happy marriage, happy Apples! Happy marriage, happy Apples!\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\nQueen Chrysalis: Hey there, my unicorn friend. Have you heard?\nUnicorn Baker: About Princess Twilight Sparkle's coronation? Who hasn't? I'm on my way there now. So much baking to do and\u2014\nQueen Chrysalis: No, no. [whispers] About the Earth ponies.\nUnicorn Baker: I know their crops have been underperforming, but, uh...\nQueen Chrysalis: That's not it. They're hoarding the food for themselves! I heard the Mayor of Appleloosa say that if unicorns and Pegasi want to eat, they can use their own hooves to dig.\nUnicorn Baker: How awful!\nQueen Chrysalis: We unicorns have to stick together, right? [sinister laughter]\n\n[transformation zap]\nLord Tirek: Ah, Chrysalis. Another successful field trip, I presume?\nQueen Chrysalis: Spreading distrust among the unicorns and Earth ponies is almost too easy. We could take down Twilight and her friends a hundred times, but as long as they have the \"love\" of Equestria behind them, they'd crawl back to defeat us. Not anymore.\nCozy Glow: No friendship, no magic! It's so obvious when you think about it. I did my part freaking out the Pegasi.\nLord Tirek: And Grogar's long absence has given me time to prepare the next part of our plan. [blows]\n[grinding]\nLord Tirek: Grogar's Bell. This artifact can steal any creature's magic. It holds that magic until it is released by this spell. Which means all the power inside is ours for the taking! [kissing]\nCozy Glow: You're drooling on the Bell.\nQueen Chrysalis: Let's try the spell before Grogar gets back. I'm sick of waiting for that old goat's master plan.\nLord Tirek: Take my hands.\n[beat]\nLord Tirek: So we can all be part of the spell. Unless you'd prefer I take all the magic myself?\nQueen Chrysalis: Our pact stands. What we do, we do together. Once we defeat the protectors of Equestria, we can claim this land and rule our kingdoms alone once more.\n[magic humming]\n[reverberating gong]\n[magic humming]\nQueen Chrysalis, Lord Tirek, and Cozy Glow: [laughing evilly]\n\n[theme song]\n\nGrogar: I have returned. Twilight Sparkle's coronation is today, and we are going to ruin it with this artifact. But to succeed, you must work together.\nQueen Chrysalis: Oh, way ahead of you, Grogar. [spits]\n[rumbling]\n[crash!]\n[magic zap]\nGrogar: The Bell! You had it all this time?! Why didn't you tell me?!\nCozy Glow: We're villains. Duh.\n[magic zap]\n[reverberating gong]\n[magic humming]\nGrogar: [pained groaning]\n[thud]\nLord Tirek: That was unexpected.\nDiscord: [snapping fingers]\nCozy Glow: Wait. Discord was Grogar? Like, the whole time? Should we follow him?\nQueen Chrysalis: Without magic, he's no threat. Besides, we have plans.\n\nPrincess Celestia: Doesn't she look so adorably regal up there?\nPrincess Luna: Our little Twilight, all grown up. Should we tell her that we've cleared out our royal suites so she and Spike can move in?\nPrincess Celestia: Oh, maybe wait until after the coronation. Twilight doesn't need anything else to worry about today.\nSpike: So, you freakin' out yet?\nTwilight Sparkle: About what?\nSpike: Oh, I don't know. It's not every day the princesses that have ruled Equestria for hundreds of moons retire and pass all their responsibilities on to your and your friends.\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, that. Actually, I'm feeling pretty good. We've all faced so much and come out okay. I know we're up to the challenge of keeping Equestria safe and happy. There's nothing we can't handle together. Which reminds me...\nSpike: Royal advisor? What's that?\nTwilight Sparkle: A new position I created for you. You've been at my side for every step of this journey. Knowing I had you to count on gave me the strength I needed to grow and succeed. I wouldn't be here without you.\nSpike: Thanks, Twilight. You know I'll always be your right-hoof dragon.\nTwilight Sparkle: I was hoping you'd say that. Because now that my crown's been fitted, we have some royal errands to run!\n\n[wind whistling]\nRarity: And you're sure this is where Pinkie told us to get the blackberries for her special coronation dessert?\nFluttershy: Maybe they keep their produce in the back?\nFruit Seller: Nope. This is all we got. But I got a special on these taters.\nRarity: [gags]\nFluttershy: Um, no, thank you. We'll keep looking.\nRarity: [gags, coughs] Ooh! Twilight, darling! You're just in time. Only one more pre-coronation stop. We're picking up the final touch for your apres-hors d'oevres gown...\nTwilight Sparkle: Is that before or after the royal marshmallow-eating-contest gown?\nRarity: What?! I haven't made one of those! You must tell me when they add these sorts of things!\nTwilight Sparkle: [laughs] It's okay, Rarity. I was just joking.\nSpike: Joking? Day of her coronation? You've come a long way, Twilight.\n[door jiggling]\nRarity: Well, that's odd. They look open.\n[knock on door]\nLemon Hearts: What do you want?\nRarity: Oh. Well, this being a thread shop, I thought I might buy some?\nLemon Hearts: Put the bits in the mail slot.\nTwilight Sparkle: What was that about?\nRarity: You know designers. Don't like being interrupted when they're on a creative roll. With thread this exquisite, can you blame them?\nRainbow Dash: Weather for the coronation is sunny skies! It was weird, though. Not many Pegasi wanted to help me clear the clouds. They were kinda on edge.\n[door opens]\n[door closes]\nSpike: They're not the only ones.\nRarity: It's the first shift in royal power in over a millenium. Of course everypony is a little jumpy. Change does that.\nFluttershy: But I'm sure it's not because they're worried about you.\nRainbow Dash: How could they be? How many times have you saved their flanks by now?\nTwilight Sparkle: You're right. I'll just have to let everypony know that even with Celestia and Luna gone, we'll make sure things stay the same.\n\nApplejack: Twilight! There you are! You mind tellin' your friend here that I don't need an official guard wherever I go? Especially if he ain't gonna help carry apples?\nTwilight Sparkle: I appreciate you taking such good care of my friends, but we're fine now.\nApplejack: It was the strangest thing. He kept callin' me \"Earth pony\", like I didn't have a name. And watchin' me like he thought I'd steal the silver!\n[loud thud]\nPinkie Pie: Do not go in that kitchen!\nRainbow Dash: You look like you were in a sugar war.\nPinkie Pie: For some reason, the bakers are super grouchy with each other. That unicorn chef started throwing dessert at Mrs. Cake! I tried to help, but I got caught in the crossfire! Tasty, tasty crossfire. [slurps]\nTwilight Sparkle: You sure this is just pre-coronation nerves?\nDiscord: [groans] My aching metatarsals! You know, you forget how convenient snap-travel is.\nSpike: Wait. Did you just walk here on foot?\nDiscord: Yes, actually. And I have a confession to make. You see, I might have made the teeeeeniest boo-boo. All very well-intentioned and noble on my part, of course, but\u2014\nApplejack: Get to the point, Discord.\nDiscord: You remember that whole thing with King Sombra? That was slightly my fault. And by \"slightly\", I mean... I brought him back.\nRarity: You did?! But why?!\nDiscord: Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time. Which is why I also brought back three other villains who are now on the loose and not really big fans of yours. So... my bad.\nMane Six and Spike: [gasp]\n\nPrincess Luna: Let me get this straight. You wanted to boost Twilight's confidence, so you brought back Chrysalis, Cozy Glow, and Tirek to attack her?!\nDiscord: Don't forget Sombra.\nPrincess Celestia: And while you united these three villains, you pretended to be Grogar?!\nFluttershy: Discord, how could you do this to Twilight?! And us?!\nDiscord: Look what a great job you did defeating Sombra. All the confidence you gained. Remember the cheering? The hoof-bumps?\nTwilight Sparkle: Except it was all a lie.\nDiscord: A well-intentioned lie.\nApplejack: For all the time you've spent with us, you really haven't picked up too much in the way of friendship lessons, huh?\nTwilight Sparkle: You've been setting up challenges for us the whole time, haven't you? None of our successes were actually real.\nDiscord: Of course they were! You just had an extremely good-looking safety net.\nSpike: And how was that supposed to help again?\nDiscord: I intended to prepare Twilight for anything by orchestrating an epic attack at her coronation.\nRarity: You beastly beast! Don't you know how much this day means to Twilight?! And me?! I made her dress! Why wait until now for such a horrible plan?!\nDiscord: You don't take a final exam on your first day of class. Just think \u2013 after defeating three baddies, Twilight would have to believe that she's the leader we all know she is!\nPrincess Celestia: You have made a grave misjudgment, Discord. Do you have anything else you'd like to tell us?!\nDiscord: Would you like the good news or the bad news?\nPrincess Luna: That wasn't the bad news?!\nDiscord: All my chaos magic is... gone. Trapped in Grogar's Bell.\nSpike: [sighs] So what's the good news?\nDiscord: Chrysalis, Tirek, and Cozy Glow now have all of the real Grogar's magic.\nRainbow Dash: in what world is that good news?!\nDiscord: Compared to me losing my powers, anything else is good news!\nPrincess Celestia: Twilight, Luna, we need to make a plan. Maybe it's not too late to stop this disaster from happening!\nTwilight Sparkle: I... I need some time to think first.\nDiscord: Well, there isn't any time! Look what I overheard them saying! [snaps]\n[beat]\nDiscord: Ugh! Just listen to my voice and use your imagination!\n\nQueen Chrysalis: [in Discord's voice] Let the fool go. Without magic, he's no threat. Besides, we have plans.\nCozy Glow: [in Discord's voice] The \"Lame Six\" are so busy being perfect, they haven't even noticed what we've been up to. Have I mentioned how great revenge is?\nLord Tirek: [in Discord's voice] I hope you got a name picked out for your future kingdom. Because it's time to destroy Equestria!\nQueen Chrysalis, Cozy Glow, and Lord Tirek: [laughing evilly in Discord's voice]\n\nDiscord: They're probably on their way to attack Canterlot right now!\nPinkie Pie: Then we'll stop 'em!\nTwilight Sparkle: How?! Stopping Sombra by himself was hard enough! And that was with lord-of-chaos training wheels!\nPrincess Celestia: Twilight, it doesn't matter if Discord set up your successes or not. We believe in you and always have.\nPrincess Luna: Lean on your strengths to counter your weaknesses.\nTwilight Sparkle: My strengths? Right! Spike! Send a letter to Star Swirl! Tell him we need the Pillars to guard the border of Canterlot!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [voiceover] If the villains are coming for a fight, we'll have one waiting for them! With Chrysalis on the loose, she'll go after Starlight! Warn Cadance and Shining Armor! They're our final line of defense if we fail!\n\nTwilight Sparkle: The ultimate battle for the fate of Equestria is coming!\n\nCozy Glow: We're not going anywhere until you two stop arguing! Chrysalis, say something nice about Tirek.\nQueen Chrysalis: [groans] He's... red.\nCozy Glow: Tirek?\nLord Tirek: She's... not as annoying as I expected.\nCozy Glow: Good! Now we were talking about Grogar's Bell.\nQueen Chrysalis: We should take the magic inside it. You know how powerful Discord was. That much chaos magic in our veins...\nLord Tirek: But taking it all would be madness! It's impossible for any other creature to control!\nCozy Glow: I guess if you need a guinea pig to find out if anypony can use chaos magic, I'll volunteer.\n[magic zap]\n[reverberating gong]\n[magic humming]\nCozy Glow: [bellowing evil laughter] Fools! Now I have more power than all of you! Kneel before my might!\n[magic zap]\n[rubber chickens squeak]\n[magic zaps]\n[pineapples snarling]\nCozy Glow: Aah! Take it back! Take it back!\n[magic zap]\n[reverberating gong]\n[magic humming]\nCozy Glow: [panting]\nLord Tirek: Still think chaos magic is a good idea?\nQueen Chrysalis: Leave it in the Bell. We've got a kingdom to conquer.\nCozy Glow: So, where should we strike first?\nQueen Chrysalis: [laughs] Everywhere.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: We've faced enemies of Equestria before. And we've always succeeded, no matter the odds. That wouldn't be possible without all of you.\nDiscord: You're welcome!\nSpike: Dude, read the room.\nTwilight Sparkle: So I ask for your help again today in what is our biggest battle yet. All of Equestria is at stake, and I can't do this alone. But I'm not afraid. Because with friendship as our armor and teamwork as our power, nopony can ever bring us down!\n[doors open]\nCozy Glow: Oh, come on!\n[thud]\nCozy Glow: Where'd you get that? A daily affirmations calendar? Yeesh.\nTwilight Sparkle: Cozy Glow?! You're\u2014!\nCozy Glow: About to wipe the floor with you!\n[zap!]\nTwilight Sparkle: Aah!

It's... not good.\n[door opens]\nTwilight Sparkle: You're here?! I was so worried! Where are the princesses?\nPinkie Pie: They put up a crazy fight so we could escape and find you! Mission accomplished! Now let's save Equestria! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!\nTwilight Sparkle: They made a terrible mistake. You all did. From the second I got away, I've been searching every book, scroll, and spell for a way to rescue you and stop Chrysalis, Tirek, and Cozy, but I haven't found anything. I failed.\nSpike: You'll come up with something. We can't save Equestria without you.\nTwilight Sparkle: You all escaped without my help. You didn't need me then. So why would anypony need me now?\nRainbow Dash: We know things look bad, but we've been in tough spots before, and we always\u2014\nTwilight Sparkle: Look around! Nothing we've ever done has mattered! Sombra? Returned and destroyed the Tree of Harmony! Chrysalis, Tirek, Cozy Glow? Returned and more powerful than ever! The School of Friendship? Shut down! Everypony in Equestria is so blinded by fear, they can't remember what friendship is! Nothing we do makes any difference!\nPinkie Pie: But we're still free and together.\nRainbow Dash: And it's not like things can get any worse.\n[windigos neighing]\n[wind howling]\nSpike: Haven't we learned never to say that by now?\n\n[windigos neighing]\nEarth Pony 2: The windigos!\n\"Winter Lotus\": [scoffs] That's just a Hearth's Warming Eve story.\nEarth Pony 2: Creatures made of wind that spread cold and misery across the land to punish ponies?! Seems pretty real to me! Let the Pegasi deal with this! There's nothing we can do except hide!\n[ponies panicking]\n\n\"Cotton Sky\": That's enchanted wind! We can't control it! And we can't rely on those snooty unicorns for any help! Build up the cloudbank! We'll try to block it!\nHyper Sonic: What about everypony down below?\n\"Cotton Sky\": They're on their own. We all are.\n\n[windigos neighing]\nUnicorn 1: Fortify the shields around the School of Magic! We need to protect ourselves! It's all we can do.\n[ponies chattering]\n\nRainbow Dash: We have to do something!\nTwilight Sparkle: I've already done enough.\nApplejack: You want the truth, Twilight? Bad things happen. No matter what you do, there's never gonna be a time when everything's perfect. But that don't mean you quit tryin'!\nTwilight Sparkle: What if I make things worse?! Ever since Celestia told me I was taking over, I've been gaining confidence. Then I find out it's all a lie. Equestria's been falling apart around us, and I didn't even notice! What kind of princess does that make me? I'm scared.\nFluttershy: I probably know more about being scared than anypony. But thanks to all of you, I've learned I'm always less scared when I'm with my friends.\nRainbow Dash: If we're facing impossible odds, we're facing them together!\nRarity: It's what we always do, darling.\nTwilight Sparkle: But we're on our own, and we have no idea what to do!\nPinkie Pie: That's true pretty much every time something terrible is about to happen.\nTwilight Sparkle: We don't have the Elements of Harmony anymore. How can you all be so calm about this?\nSpike: Because, even if you don't believe you can do this, we do. We believe in you. In us.\nApplejack: The truth is, all our lives wouldn't be the same if we hadn't met. We're better off because of our friendship with you. So when you say you haven't made a difference, that's just not true. You've made a big difference to us.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you. Sometimes even the Princess of Friendship needs a reminder that there's more to the Magic of Friendship than rainbow lasers.\nSpike: Although that part is pretty cool.\nTwilight Sparkle: We still need a plan.\n[door opens]\nPrincess Cadance: That sounds like the pony I used to foal-sit for. Count us in.\nTwilight Sparkle: No. You need to stay here and protect Flurry Heart. If we don't... If things don't work out, she's Equestria's last hope. Okay. Three of our worst villains have taken over, powered up by ancient magic. Everypony in Equestria is so scared and divided that the windigos are circling. And it's up to us to fix it all.\nPinkie Pie: What are we gonna do, Twilight?!\nTwilight Sparkle: The same thing we do every time, Pinkie. Try to save the world!\n\nLord Tirek: Every prisoner is safely in their cells. Now we can hunt down the rest of the\u2014 Windigos?\nCozy Glow: I'm not hunting anypony d-d-d-down in this weather! Can't we magically get rid of them and w-w-w-warm things up?\nQueen Chrysalis: I don't think we should. This could work out quite well for me.\nLord Tirek: You mean us.\nQueen Chrysalis: The harsh weather is the final blow to break the ponies' spirits. Once Equestria is a frozen wasteland, we'll use our magic to destroy those windy beasts. Ponies will be so grateful, they'll do whatever I want!\nLord Tirek: The windigos are ancient magic. It would be unwise to leave them unchecked. Best we deal with them now.\nQueen Chrysalis: [snarls]\nCozy Glow: We probably should deal with Twilight and her friends before anything else.\nLord Tirek: I thought it was too cold for you to hunt anypony down.\nCozy Glow: We don't need to. They're right there!\n\nSpike: You think they know we're here?\n[magic whooshing]\nApplejack: I'd say they have an idea.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: That bell has Discord, Celestia, and Luna's magic inside. If they use it against us\u2014\nFluttershy: Discord's magic is so chaotic, he's the only one who can use it.\nQueen Chrysalis: You just can't accept that you were beaten before you even realized there was a fight, can you?\nTwilight Sparkle: You can't beat us if we never give up! As long as I have my friends by my side, I'll put my faith in friendship\u2014\nCozy Glow: Ugh, can we get on with this please?\n[zap!]\n[boom!]\n[teleportation zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: We need to get that bell and get Discord and the princesses their magic back. Rainbow Dash, Pinkie, you're with me.\nRainbow Dash: Sweet! I'll grab that bell in ten second\u2014!\nTwilight Sparkle: No. We're the distraction. They're gonna get the bell.\n[boom!]\nQueen Chrysalis: Come out, come out, wherever you are!\nCozy Glow: There!\nPinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash: [yell]\n[magic zaps]\n[whoosh!]\nCozy Glow: Whoa!\n[teleportation zap]\n[neck cracking]\n[whoosh!]\nTwilight Sparkle: [yells]\nLord Tirek: Aah!\n[thud]\nPinkie Pie: Step right up, evil fillies and gentlevillains! Try your luck!\n[zap!]\nQueen Chrysalis: [growls]\n[zap!]\nQueen Chrysalis: grunting]\nPinkie Pie: Missed me!\n[zap!]\nPinkie Pie: Close, but no cherrychimichanga!\n[zap!]\nPinkie Pie: [laughs] Thanks for playing!\n[zap!]\nCozy Glow: Do they have to be so annoying?!\n[zap!]\nQueen Chrysalis: Not annoying! Distracting!\n[boom!]\n[zap!]\nSpike: Aah!\n[magic surging]\n[shatter!]\nSpike: [breathes fire]\n[zap!]\n[boom!]\n[magic zaps]\nApplejack: [grunts]\n[rope snaps]\nCozy Glow: Now, now, professor. We all know you're not the fast one.\n[zap!]\nQueen Chrysalis: Enough! Or the dragon's wings get plucked!\nSpike: [groans]\nTwilight Sparkle: Please! Don't hurt him!\nSpike: Don't worry about me! Just save\u2014! [groans]\nLord Tirek: Turns out that the Magic of Friendship is your biggest weakness. A fitting end to your pathetic story.\n[magic whirring]\nRainbow Dash: No matter what, we face it together!\n[windigos howl]\n[zap!]\n[boom!]\n[magic humming]\nSpike: What happened? Can I open my eyes?\nApplejack: Ya sure can! Way to go, Twilight!\nTwilight Sparkle: It's not me!\n[marching sounds]\n[whooshing]\n[transformation zaps]\nLord Tirek: Don't let them escape!\nCozy Glow: Which ones?!\n[zap!]\n[stomps]\n[whooshing]\nCozy Glow: Whoa!\n[magic zaps]\nThorax: The changelings won't fool them forever. And I don't know how long the unicorns' shield will hold.\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't understand. How are you all here?\nGallus: That's kinda our fault.\nSmolder: You know those long lectures about friendship you gave at school?\n\n[windigos howling]\n[ponies panicking]\nSandbar: We all know the story of Hearth's Warming Eve! We can defeat the windigos together!\nBerryshine: You really think if we all sing a couple songs, everything will be fine?\nSandbar: It's not just singing that saved the founders of Equestria! It's what it represented!\n\nRasberry[sic] Dazzle: Earth ponies, unicorns, and Pegasi becoming friends! We learned at Twilight's school that friendship is the most powerful magic there is!\n\nHyper Sonic: Focusing on our differences keeps us divided! Villains and creatures like the windigos use that division against us!\n\nYona: Yaks strong. Ponies strong. But yaks and ponies stronger together! Yaks must be loyal to pony friends!\n\nSmolder: I know helping other creatures by being kind and generous sounds lame. But I've seen how powerful it can be!\n\nGallus: Playing together! Singing together! Even laughing together! That's what real heroes look like!\n\nSilverstream: Were we really happy by ourselves at the bottom of the ocean? Be honest! It's the ponies that showed us a better way!\n\nOcellus: They've taught us how powerful love and the Magic of Friendship truly is! We can't let them stand alone! We're their friends! They need us!\n\nApplejack: How 'bout that? It's just like you said the day we opened that school.\nSpike: The more creatures who know about friendship, the safer we'll be.\nPinkie Pie: We told you you had it all figured out!\n[thud!]\n[thud!]\n[cracking]\n[magic zaps]\n[zap!]\nTwilight Sparkle: ENOUGH! Because of you, I almost lost my way! But everycreature here has reminded me of the true power of friendship! There will always be darkness in the world, but there will also always be those who find the light! The Pillars knew this! That's why they created the Elements of Harmony! The Elements showed me and my friends how strong our friendship could be! Together we worked to bring harmony to Equestria! But there will always be more to do! Which is why we teach others about the Magic of Friendship! Others who will continue our mission after we are gone! Now I truly understand! The Elements were just symbols! The real magic has always been right here! And the more who understand how powerful friendship is, the stronger we will all be! Together!\n[magic surging]\n[boom!]\nCozy Glow: This is bad, isn't it?\n[BOOM!]\n[magic humming]\n[clang!]\nCozy Glow: [groans]\nQueen Chrysalis: You think friendship will save you?! We will always return! Nothing will ever stop\u2014!\n[splat!]\n[rain falling]\nSpike: [slurps] Chocolate rain?\n[teleportation zaps]\nDiscord: Don't look at me!\n[electrical discharge]\nTwilight Sparkle: Pinkie! You took Discord's magic from the bell?! How do you feel?\nPinkie Pie: Hmmm... Tingly. Itchy. Also like...\n[slam!]\nPinkie Pie: i could transform the cosmos so everything is made of icing!\nDiscord: Perhaps maybe I should...\n[reverberating gong]\nPinkie Pie: [dizzily] Waiter! There's some chaos in my soup!\n[reverberating gong]\nDiscord: [snaps]\n[pineapple snarls]\n[reverberating gong]\nPrincess Celestia: There isn't a punishment worthy of all you've done!\nDiscord: [whispering] You know what I would do if I were... [indistinct]\nPrincess Luna: Oh. That does seem fitting.\nDiscord: May I help? Please?\n[zap!]\n[boom!]\n[cracking]\nQueen Chrysalis: [snarls]\n[thud!]\nDiscord: Together forever. I can't think of anything that they would want less!\n[ponies cheering]\nPrincess Celestia: When I sent you to Ponyville, I had high hopes. When you became Princess of Friendship, I knew I made the right choice. But nothing could prepare me for how proud I am right now. Equestria is definitely in the right hooves. You are ready.\nTwilight Sparkle: You know what? I think I am.\nApplejack: Thank goodness. First question, your Highness. What do we do with all these creatures?\nPinkie Pie: We're gonna need a lot more chairs for the coronation!\nTwilight Sparkle: Actually, as ruler of Equestria, I'd like to postpone the coronation for a while. At least until the castle's rebuilt. Besides, there's something we need to do first.\n\nRarity: Post-apocalyptic donuts. Interesting choice.\nTwilight Sparkle: I know. But there's gonna be plenty of time for all the challenges and struggles and adventures to come. For now, I just want to spend a quiet moment with the six best friends I've ever had.\nApplejack: Well, mostly quiet.\nPinkie Pie: [eating noisily] Mmmm!\nFluttershy: It's like the end of an era.\nRainbow Dash: Or the beginning of an even more awesome era!\nTwilight Sparkle: All I know is whatever comes next is going to be perfect.\nSpike: How do you know that?\nTwilight Sparkle: With you guys by my side, how could it not?\nMane Six and Spike: [laugh]\n\n[credits]\n"}, {"full_transcript": "\n[ponies and creatures chattering]\n[camera clicks]\n[door opens]\nFuture Spike: I got here as soon as I could, but friendship ambassador is a full time job these days. Making peace between Abyssinians and the Diamond Dogs has not been easy.\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: That's why I picked you for the job. But I'm glad you could come.\nFuture Spike: So what's the emergency?\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: Ever since I took over Celestia's School, my focus has been on teaching magic. But now it seems my top student has missed the most important lesson of all.\nFuture Spike: What do you mean?\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: Let's just say it'll be good to have my royal advisor and friendship ambassador by my side.\nFuture Gallus: Your Majesty, she's here.\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: Send her in, Gallus.\n[door opens]\nLuster Dawn: Your Majesty.\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: Luster, I may be ruler of Equestria, but I'm still just your teacher.\nLuster Dawn: And you've been wonderful. I've enjoyed every moment at the School of Magic. But I'm just not sure it's the right place for me.\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: I see.\nLuster Dawn: And it's not the work. I could spend weeks in the library doing research. It's just that there's a lot of focus on making friends.\nFuture Spike: If that's your problem, you've come to the right place.\nLuster Dawn: But that's just it. I don't want to make friends.\nFuture Spike: What?! [clears throat]\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: So you'd rather leave the School of Magic than make friends?\nLuster Dawn: I was hoping to set up an independent course of study. I want to accomplish as much as you have someday.\nFuture Spike: It'll be hard to do that without friends.\nLuster Dawn: I'm not so sure. Friendship looks like more of a distraction than anything else and ultimately a waste of time.\nFuture Spike: What?!\nLuster Dawn: I know you and your friends accomplished a lot together, but that was so long ago, and as far as I can see, you rule by yourself now.\nFuture Spike: Uh, hello? Royal advisor right here.\nLuster Dawn: And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. In fact, I think it's better. Plus, if friendships ultimately fade, why even make them in the first place?\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: You know what, Luster Dawn? You're right.\nFuture Spike: WHAT?!\n\n[theme song]\n\nFuture Spike: Friendship is more trouble than it's worth?! [to Twilight] This is your top student?\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: Friendships take work, and there's no guarantee they'll last. They can be complicated. They can be messy. And they never go the way you plan. Friendship is a hard thing to navigate. I remember the first time I realized it might not last forever.\n\nTwilight Sparkle: [panting, yelping]\nSpike: Twilight? Uh, I'm pretty sure that's everything.\nTwilight Sparkle: I'm just doing a final check, Spike.\nSpike: But we did a final check. Of every room. Twice.\nTwilight Sparkle: Ah-ha! See? An issue of Power Ponies. Now, aren't you glad we triple-checked?\nSpike: Thanks, but I already read this one. I don't need to take it to Canterlot.\nTwilight Sparkle: No-no-no! You love Power Ponies. We're taking it.\nSpike: Really, Twilight, we don't have to bring the comic. I'm not even sure how much longer I'll collect them. A lot is changing, and I am getting older.\nTwilight Sparkle: Just because things change doesn't mean you leave everything you love behind! [sighs]\nSpike: You're not still worried about ruling Equestria, are you?\nTwilight Sparkle: No. I know it took some time, but I've never been more ready for anything in my life. Just because I'm ready to sit on the throne in Canterlot, doesn't mean I'm ready to leave Ponyville. When we were all fighting to save Equestria from Tirek, Chrysalis, and Cozy Glow, I was too busy to think about it. But now it's all happening at once.\nSpike: What is?\nTwilight Sparkle: The coronation. Moving. Leaving our friends.\nSpike: I thought we'd all be ruling Equestria together.\nTwilight Sparkle: Of course we will, but it won't be the same. They all have lives here. We're moving away and they're not, and I can't help but feel like we're leaving them behind. What if we all just drift apart?\nSpike: I guess I hadn't thought about it like that. Maybe you should talk to them. I bet they're feeling the same way.\nTwilight Sparkle: You're right, Spike. Thanks. Sometimes talking to a good friend is all it takes.\n\n[crates closing]\n[stamping]\nTwilight Sparkle: So, you're not worried about how things might change with me living in Canterlot?\nApplejack: Of course not. Change is natural, like the seasons. That's just life on the farm.\nTwilight Sparkle: I guess so.\nApplejack: Anyhoo, I really need to get all these boxes packed and sorted. There's a lot more work now that the folks beyond Equestria are comin' to the coronation, too.\n\nPinkie Pie: Worried? Pfft! No way! Unless you're talking about the coronation, because then yes. Obviously the cakes are handled, but there's the whole rest of the party to stay on top of. [whispering] And honestly, I'm not convinced Gummy really took care of the fireworks.\n[sparkler sizzling]\nTwilight Sparkle: But what about after the coronation? Don't you think things are gonna be different?\nPinkie Pie: Well, since I'll be in charge of all the Canterlot galas from now on, I'll have to go there a lot more. So I guess that's different, but I don't think I mind.\nTwilight Sparkle: No. Of course not.\n\n[birds chirping]\n[doves cooing]\nFluttershy: Wonderful work, everyone! We couldn't be more ready. Josephine, if you and the rest of the doves leave now, we should all arrive in Canterlot at the same time.\n[doves cooing]\nFluttershy: Eloise and Hubert, you should go, too. I know it's a long way, but don't worry. I'll bring plenty of snacks to restore your energy before we perform.\n[swans honking]\nFluttershy: Everyone else gets to ride since the trip's too much for your little wings. We need everyone in tip-top shape for the coronation. I'm glad we got the chance for one last rehearsal. Everyone's so excited. But I can't imagine anypony's more excited than you. Moving to Canterlot. Being crowned. I can't think of a single bad thing about any of it!\nTwilight Sparkle: [nervous laugh] Yeah. Me, neither.\n\nRainbow Dash: In three, two, one, and...\n[whooshing]\n[smack!]\n[zoom!]\n[soft thud]\nSpitfire: Look, Rainbow Dash. I know this is important to you, and we all want the routine to be special, but are you sure it needs to be this complicated?\nRainbow Dash: Of course! And I know we can pull it off! Sorry, Twilight. I don't have time to talk. We've got a lot more work to do before the coronation.\nTwilight Sparkle: [sighs]\n\nRarity: Darling, change is an integral part of fashion. I myself am considering opening boutiques for non-ponies. Things must evolve, or they become stale. For example... I was just struck with a sudden inspiration to change my design for your gown by including the webs of these star spiders. They glow for a short while after they're spun. They won't have much time to weave the sash, but the effect will be dazzling. You see, darling? Change can be fabulous if you embrace it!\n\n[doors open]\nSpike: Starlight is supposed to come over soon. There's a little something we wanted to give you before we leave. You know what? I think you're right, Twilight. I should take my comics to Canterlot. We can't leave the Power Ponies behind.\nTwilight Sparkle: I don't think the Power Ponies care, Spike. Just like all of our friends.\nApplejack: All right, Twilight. Are you ready? We all wanted to see you off, but there's still a lot to do.\nSpike: Aren't you coming on the train?\nApplejack: I gotta go with Big Mac so we can go over our packin' list or we won't know who gets what deliveries.\nRainbow Dash: And I'm gonna meet the Wonderbolts so we can go over the routine one last time.\nPinkie Pie: I'm going with Gummy. He said he knows when the fireworks display should start, but does anypony really believe that?!\nFluttershy: And I still need to pick up food for the swans and doves who flew ahead to Canterlot. If I don't get them fed, they'll be too pooped to perform.\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, I'll be living in Canterlot alone. Might as well take the train alone, too. Bye, I guess.\nRarity: Oh, you won't be traveling alone, darling. I'll have just enough time on the train to weave the star spider sash for your gown. But we should leave now. There's no time to dawdle if you want the coronation to be perfect.\nTwilight Sparkle: That's the problem! You're all so worried about making my coronation perfect, but I'm leaving Ponyville and none of you even care!\nRest of Mane Six: [gasp]\n\nLuster Dawn: Exactly. You moved away, your friends didn't care, and that was that.\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: Actually, not exactly.\n\nApplejack: Of course we care that you're movin', Twilight.\nFluttershy: I can't believe you'd think we don't.\nPinkie Pie: What could possibly make you think that?\nTwilight Sparkle: I tried to talk to you all about how I was feeling, but you seemed more worried about what you had to do for the coronation.\nSpike: It's true. I was there.\nRarity: I suppose it gave us something else to focus on.\nApplejack: I knew you were worried about everything changin'. I guess I thought if I made it seem like everything was okay, it would be.\nFluttershy: I was just trying to make you feel better. That way I wouldn't feel so terrible.\nTwilight Sparkle: Before I moved to Ponyville, I didn't really know what friendship was. You've all taught me so much. I can't believe it all might be ending. But when I imagine the future, all I can think about is that we won't be together! I'm literally moving away from you, and it's terrifying!\nFluttershy: I'm scared, too.\nPinkie Pie: Me, too.\nRarity: Rattled to the core.\nApplejack: Eeyup.\nRainbow Dash: I wouldn't say scared.\n[beat]\nRainbow Dash: Buuuut just because I won't say it doesn't mean I don't feel it.\nPinkie Pie: I'm going to miss you so much!\nRarity: I just can't stop thinking about how much things are going to change!\nRainbow Dash: W... What if we don't see each other?\nFluttershy: What if we don't talk as much?\nApplejack: What if we don't stay friends?!\nRest of Mane Six: [crying]\nTwilight Sparkle: I know it's weird, but knowing you're all are as upset as I am actually makes me less worried.\nSpike: That's nice, but you should be more worried about missing the train to Canterlot!\n[doors open]\nStarlight Glimmer: Sorry, I'm so late. I actually thought I'd missed you\u2014\nSpike: There's no time!\n[smack!]\n[thud]\n\n[train whistle blows]\nTwilight Sparkle: Oh, no! We missed it! But maybe...\n[teleportation zap]\nTwilight Sparkle: Okay. We're on the train. Everything should be fine, right?\n[beat]\nRarity: I'd worked out exactly how much time I needed to weave my star spider sash, and now I'm behind!\nApplejack: I hope Big Mac can figure out who gets what deliveries on his own.\n\nSavoir Fare: I assume these contain the finest sparkling apple juice?\nBig McIntosh: Eeyup!\n\nBaker Pony: Ah, the Sweet Apple Acres applesauce for my coronation parfait! This is, uh, the applesauce?\nBig McIntosh: Uhhh... eeyup?\n\nFluttershy: [sighs] I don't have the snacks the doves and swans will need to perform after their long flight. I'd better find the food car.\n[star spiders screech]\n[hummingbirds tweet]\nRainbow Dash: And I need to meet the Wonderbolts!\n[zoom!]\n\nRainbow Dash: Where's the coronation team?\nJanitor Pony: Well, they waited, but when you didn't show, they thought you must've meant to meet outside of Canterlot.\nRainbow Dash: [growls]\n\nPinkie Pie: The only thing I'm worried about is Gummy handling the fireworks display. But I'm sure it's fine. [nervous laugh]\nTwilight Sparkle: Well, it could always be worse.\n[brakes screech]\n[sheep baaing]\n\n[doors open]\nTwilight Sparkle: [panting]\nPrincess Luna: Goodness, Twilight. Are you all right?\nTwilight Sparkle: My friends and I had a few hiccups on the way. But everything's fine now.\n[sheep baaing]\nPrincess Celestia: We really are both just so proud of you. If you need a moment, that's all right. It is your coronation.\n[trumpet fanfare]\nPrincess Luna: Although it would be nice to get started. Are you ready?\nRarity: NO! She can't possibly be crowned without wearing her coronation gown!\nPrincess Celestia: Very well. [to audience] Citizens of Equestria and beyond!\n[crowd cheering]\n[yaks stomping]\n[dragons breathing fire]\nPrincess Celestia: My sister and I have ruled this land for quite some time, but even we know that change eventually comes to us all. And though we know it can be unsettling, it's as natural as the rising and setting of the sun and the moon. Both of which my sister and I feel confident leaving in the hooves of the pony who will come after us.\nTwilight Sparkle: [whimpering]\nRarity: You look amazing. Ooh! I almost forgot!\nPrincess Celestia: And so without further ado, I give you the new ruler of Equestria - Princess Twilight Sparkle!\nTwilight Sparkle: [yelps]\n[thud]\nPrincess Celestia: [gasps]\n[crowd gasps]\nTwilight Sparkle: Sorry.\n[magic surges]\n[crowd ooh's]\nPrincess Luna: Um, Twilight?\n[birds chirp]\n[star spiders screech]\nFluttershy: Oh, dear. I know these aren't the snacks I promised, but it's all I could find.\n[swans honk]\nSpitfire: Well, Dash or no Dash, Twilight's about to get that crown. Wonderbolts, roll out!\n[zoom!]\nRainbow Dash: No! Wait!\n[zoom!]\n[fireworks explode]\n[swans honk]\nTwilight Sparkle: Aah!\n[crowd gasps]\nApplejack: To Twilight!\n[splat]\n[crowd murmuring]\nPrincess Luna: Hmm. Close enough.\nTwilight Sparkle: [whimpers]\n\nLuster Dawn: Okay, I get it now. Your coronation was such a disaster that you and your friends never really recovered, and that's why you all drifted apart.\nFuture Spike: Well, you're half right.\n\nLuster Dawn: So the coronation wasn't a disaster and your friendships just faded away over time?\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: Not exactly.\n[door opens]\nFuture Pinkie Pie: [sighs] Sorry I'm late. But it is so hard to find a sitter with a sense of humor for Li'l Cheese.\n[Boneless 6 squeaking]\nFuture Rarity: Honestly, I would have been here sooner, but you would not believe how busy Yakyakistan is these days.\nFuture Rainbow Dash: Maybe we could get to places on time if you let me do some of the chores instead of always doing everything yourself.\nFuture Applejack: Maybe I would if you did them the right way. Oh. Sorry. We're not the last ones, are we?\nFuture Fluttershy: Discord's headed to an O&O convention or he'd be joining us.\nLuster Dawn: I just assumed that since you all aren't together all the time now\u2014\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: That we aren't friends?\nFuture Mane Six and Spike: [laugh]\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: That is not the point of my story. It's true my coronation was a disaster.\n\nPinkie Pie: [gulps] Well, at least the coronation is over.\nTwilight Sparkle: [groans]\nPinkie Pie: [snickers]\nMane Six: [laugh]\nTwilight Sparkle: That was something.\nStarlight Glimmer: I was just about to say the same thing. I know maybe it wasn't the coronation you planned, but it's good to see all of you laughing.\nSpike: We wanted to give this to you before you left Ponyville, but things got a little hectic.\nStarlight Glimmer: Since you're moving away, we thought if you missed any of us or Ponyville, this might help.\nTwilight Sparkle: Awww.\nPinkie Pie: It's a book of memories.\nApplejack: And we all chipped in some.\nFluttershy: No matter how much things change, you'll always have this to look back on.\nTwilight Sparkle: I love it. Thank you so much. But I don't want to only look back. Obviously the coronation wasn't perfect, but that doesn't matter. It's our relationships that really count, and we have to maintain them.\nRarity: But now that we'll be living in different places, I'm not exactly sure how.\nTwilight Sparkle: I am. I suggest we meet once a moon. In fact, my first royal decree as ruler of Equestria is to establish this Council of Friendship!\nMane Six, Starlight Glimmer, and Spike: [cheer]\nPrincess Celestia: And what a wonderful decree it is!\nPrincess Luna: We always knew that whatever adversity you faced, you and your friends would find your way through it together.\nPrincess Celestia: We know Equestria is in the perfect hooves with you and your friends looking out for it. And while we'll always be here if you need us, it's time for us to be on our way.\nTwilight Sparkle: You're leaving?\nPrincess Luna: We hope you'll come and visit us in Silver Shoals.\nPrincess Celestia: But now it's time for you to rule on your own. You're all more than capable.\nTwilight Sparkle: Thank you. For everything. Mmmm! [chuckling]\nAll: [laughing]\n\nLuster Dawn: So, even though everything changed and you moved away from your friends, you didn't grow apart? And this is the Council of Friendship? That's what you're all doing here?\nFuture Rainbow Dash: Duh! This time every moon.\nFuture Applejack: [chuckles] What she means is this is how we've been rulin' together.\nFuture Rarity: And how we've continued to face every problem and threat to Equestria over the years.\nFuture Pinkie Pie: But mostly, it's how we keep in touch. No matter how busy life gets.\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: Sometimes friendships can be hard, and it takes work to maintain them. But without friends, things can be a lot harder.\nLuster Dawn: I never thought about friendship being something to work at, and I don't mind work. I guess if they don't have to fade away, maybe making friends isn't the waste of time I thought. But I've been so focused on my studies, I wouldn't know where to start.\nFuture Twilight Sparkle: That's all right, because I know exactly where to send you.\n\n[Future Twilight Sparkle]\nWhen I started out, I was unsure\nI thought I knew all that I needed, didn't know what to expect\nBut when my walls came down, I saw the truth\nAll along something was missing\nAnd I think you'll see it, too\n\nWhen I started out, I was unsure\nI thought I knew all that I needed, didn't know what to expect\nBut when my walls came down, I saw the truth\nAll along something was missing\nAnd I think you'll see it, too\n\nThis is where the magic happens\nThis is where the magic lives\nOur friendships weave together stronger\nThe bonds grow deeper, lasting longer\nAnd the greatest spell you'll know\nIs how the Magic of Friendship grows\n\nThis is where the magic happens\nThis is where the magic lives\nOur friendships weave together stronger\nThe bonds grow deeper, lasting longer\nAnd the greatest spell you'll know\nIs how the Magic of Friendship grows\n\n[Future Pinkie Pie]\nAnd no matter how much time goes by\nThe party will still be here with some fun new games to try\n\nAnd no matter how much time goes by\nThe party will still be here with some fun new games to try\n\n[Future Rainbow Dash]\nBig adventure's waiting obviously\nLong as we're still here together\nWe'll be flying happily\n\nBig adventure's waiting obviously\nLong as we're still here together\nWe'll be flying happily\n\n[Twilight, Pinkie Pie, and Rainbow Dash]\nThis is where the magic happens (where the magic happens)\nThis is where the magic lives (where the magic lives)\nOur friendships weave together stronger\nThe bonds grow deeper, lasting longer\nAnd the greatest spell there is\nWhat the Magic of Friendship gives\n\nThis is where the magic happens (where the magic happens)\nThis is where the magic lives (where the magic lives)\nOur friendships weave together stronger\nThe bonds grow deeper, lasting longer\nAnd the greatest spell there is\nWhat the Magic of Friendship gives\n\n[Future Applejack]\nAnd it's somethin' true to pass on down\nTo generations yet to come\n\nAnd it's somethin' true to pass on down\nTo generations yet to come\n\n[Future Rarity]\nAnd we'll never stop believing in\nThe generosity of the friendships we've won\n\nAnd we'll never stop believing in\nThe generosity of the friendships we've won\n\n[Future Fluttershy]\nAnd because the love that I feel\nFor every single living creature is something that is real\nFriendship happens so naturally\n\nAnd because the love that I feel\nFor every single living creature is something that is real\nFriendship happens so naturally\n\n[Future Twilight Sparkle]\nOh, and how I used to wonder\n\nOh, and how I used to wonder\n\n[Choir]\n(Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh...)\n\n(Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh...)\n\n[Future Twilight Sparkle]\nWhat friendship could be!\n\nWhat friendship could be!\n\n[All]\nThis is where the magic happens (where the magic happens)\nThis is where the magic lives (where the magic lives)\nOur friendships weave together stronger\nThe bonds grow deeper, lasting longer\nAnd the greatest spell you'll know (you'll know)\nIs how the Magic of Friendship grows\n\nThis is where the magic happens (where the magic happens)\nThis is where the magic lives (where the magic lives)\nOur friendships weave together stronger\nThe bonds grow deeper, lasting longer\nAnd the greatest spell you'll know (you'll know)\nIs how the Magic of Friendship grows\n\n[Future Twilight Sparkle]\nHow the Magic of Friendship grows\n\nHow the Magic of Friendship grows\n\n[\"My Little Pony\" theme melody]\nTHE END\n\n[credits]\n"}]}]
