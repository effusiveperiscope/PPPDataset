[{"season": "1", "eps": [{"summary": " A narrator describes two royal sisters who ruled over the magical land of Equestria. The elder sister used her powers to raise the sun, while the younger sister brought out the moon at night. The younger sister became resentful because the ponies of Equestria relished daytime but slept at night. One night, she refused to lower the moon. She transformed into Nightmare Moon, a \"wicked mare of darkness,\" and vowed to shroud Equestria in eternal night. Her sister used the Elements of Harmony to banish her to the moon, and took on responsibility for both sun and moon. The narrator\u2019s voice changes to that of Twilight Sparkle, who reads that harmony has been maintained in Equestria ever since.\n Twilight walks by Lemon Hearts, Twinkleshine, and Minuette, who invite her to Moon Dancer's party. Twilight says she has to study and runs off.\nShe enters a library atop an ivory tower and instructs Spike to find a book called Predictions and Prophecies. Twilight realizes that Nightmare Moon will return on the day of the Summer Sun Celebration, which is the day after tomorrow. She sends a letter to Princess Celestia to alert her. Celestia's reply to Twilight says that she trusts Twilight completely, but she has to stop reading \"those dusty old books\".\nSpike continues to read Celestia's letter on the way to Ponyville. Celestia tells Twilight that there's more to life than studying, and tasks her with supervising the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration in Ponyville. The letter ends with one other task for her: make some friends. She at first attempts to say \"hello\" to a pink pony, but the pink pony simply gasps dramatically and speeds off.\n Once they reach Ponyville, Twilight and Spike visit Sweet Apple Acres to check on the catering for the Summer Sun Celebration first. Applejack cordially greets Twilight, and members of her family offer her food samples. Twilight wants to leave, but she grudgingly accepts the family\u2019s invitation to stay for brunch. After brunch, Twilight looks at the cloudy sky and remarks that Rainbow Dash isn't doing a very good job of clearing the sky for the festival. Rainbow Dash says she will do it after she practices some flying moves to show the Wonderbolts at the festival. She demonstrates her speed and agility by clearing the sky in \"ten seconds flat.\" She says she can\u2019t wait to hang out with Twilight some more, and flies away.\n Twilight and Spike visit Rarity, who is decorating the town hall. Spike is instantly smitten with Rarity. She is shocked by Twilight's messy mane and gives her a makeover in Carousel Boutique. She is impressed when Twilight mentions that she is from Canterlot. Eager to get away from the fashionista, Twilight and Spike sneak out of the boutique.\n The last item to check for the Summer Sun Celebration is music. Twilight greets Fluttershy and compliments her bird choir, but Fluttershy is too shy to introduce herself. However, she gets excited when she sees Spike because she has never seen a baby dragon before. She follows Twilight and Spike to Golden Oak Library, where they will be staying.\n Inside the library, Twilight and Spike are greeted with a surprise party. Pinkie Pie, the pink pony Twilight encountered earlier, starts talking to Twilight about how she was surprised to see a new pony in town and decided to throw her a party. Twilight accidentally drinks hot sauce and runs out of the room with her mane on fire. In her bedroom on the second floor, Twilight complains that making friends has left her no time to read about the Elements of Harmony. She guesses that Princess Celestia sent her to Ponyville because she thinks the Mare in the Moon is just an \"old pony's tale.\"\n In the town hall, Mayor Mare announces the beginning of the Summer Sun Celebration, but Princess Celestia is absent. Nightmare Moon steps out of a glowing blue fog and addresses the cowering ponies:\nRainbow Dash tries to fly towards Nightmare Moon, but Applejack pulls her back. Pinkie tries to guess Nightmare Moon's name, but Applejack shoves a cupcake in her mouth to stop her from doing so. Twilight declares that the dark Alicorn is the Mare in the Moon\u2014 Nightmare Moon. Impressed, Nightmare Moon asks Twilight if she also knows why she's here, but Twilight is too terrified to answer. Nightmare Moon proclaims that the night will last forever, and cackles as a thunderstorm builds up around her, with Twilight looking on in disbelief and fear.\n"}, {"summary": "At the Golden Oak Library, Twilight Sparkle and her friends find a book about the Elements of Harmony. They learn that the elements of kindness, laughter, generosity, honesty, and loyalty are known, but the sixth is a mystery. The book also says that the Elements are stored in the royal sisters' ancient castle in the Everfree Forest. The ponies decide to look for the Elements but are unaware that Nightmare Moon has been listening to their conversation the whole time.\nThe ponies enter the Everfree Forest. When they are walking on a mountainside, a cloud of purple smoke triggers a landslide. Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash catch Rarity and Pinkie Pie, but Twilight slides to the edge of a steep cliff. Applejack assures Twilight that she will be safe if she lets go of the cliff. Twilight lets go, and Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy catch her.\n\nAn angry manticore confronts the ponies. When the other ponies try to forcefully subdue it, Fluttershy tells them to stop. She kindly approaches the manticore. It shows her a thorn stuck in its paw. She removes the thorn and the grateful manticore licks her mane. The thorn dissolves into purple smoke, which zooms away.\nThe cloud of purple smoke makes monstrous faces appear on the trees around the ponies. All the ponies except for Pinkie are scared. Pinkie sings the Laughter Song and teaches her friends to laugh at their fears. The friends' laughter turns the trees back to normal.The ponies come across a river blocked by a sea serpent. The sea serpent is upset that a \"tacky little cloud of purple smoke\" whisked by and tore off half his mustache. Rarity generously donates her own tail to repair the sea serpent's mustache. The sea serpent, extremely pleased and grateful, helps the ponies cross the river.\nWhen the castle ruins come into view, Twilight races excitedly toward them but nearly falls into a gorge, prompting Rainbow Dash to save her by the tail. As the ponies discover, the bridge leading to the ruins is broken. When Rainbow Dash flies to the other side to fix the bridge, three Pegasi appear and invite her to be captain of the Shadowbolts, their group of elite fliers. When Rainbow Dash learns that she must abandon her friends to join the Shadowbolts, she turns down the Shadowbolts and ties the bridge so her friends can cross. The Shadowbolts turn into purple smoke, which slithers away.\n The ponies enter the castle ruins and find five stone orbs, which Twilight believes are the first five Elements of Harmony. Nightmare Moon creates a purple whirlwind that teleports Twilight and the orbs to another tower. Nightmare Moon and Twilight face off, resulting in Nightmare Moon shattering the orbs in front of her. The five ponies run into the hall and comfort Twilight. Twilight realizes that the spirits of the Elements are present, and she explains how her friends represent the elements of honesty, kindness, laughter, generosity, and loyalty. The fragments of the orbs begin to circle the friends. A stone orb magically appears over Twilight, and she declares:\n The orb fragments form golden jeweled necklaces on the five friends' necks, and Twilight's orb becomes a crown. The Elements glow and the ponies are lifted into the air. A rainbow-colored double helix envelopes Nightmare Moon, and the room is flooded with light. When the light fades, the friends discover that the gems on their necklaces resemble their cutie marks, and Rarity's tail has magically grown back.\nPrincess Celestia appears with the sunrise and explains that Twilight had the magic to defeat Nightmare Moon as long as she let true friendship into her heart. Nightmare Moon returns to her original form, Princess Luna. The friends learn that Luna is Celestia's younger sister, and the sisters reconcile and reunite after one thousand years of separation.\n Back in Ponyville, Pinkie throws a party to celebrate the royal sisters' reunion. When Twilight tells Celestia that she doesn't want to leave her new friends, Celestia gives her a new mission: to continue studying the magic of friendship in Ponyville and report back her findings. Twilight promises to study harder than ever, much to the delight of her new friends and the citizens of Ponyville."}, {"summary": "Twilight Sparkle and Spike are helping Applejack harvest apples when Twilight receives a letter from Princess Celestia containing two tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala. Applejack says that if she goes to the gala, she will open an apple stand and earn money for her family. Suddenly Rainbow Dash crash-lands and asks about the tickets. She tells Twilight she hopes to perform flying stunts at the gala to impress the Wonderbolts and, hopefully, be asked to join their troupe. Applejack and Rainbow Dash argue about the spare ticket until Twilight says she will think about it during lunch.\nTwilight comes across Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Fluttershy, who also want to attend the gala. Pinkie\u00a0sings a song\u00a0about playing games and partying at the gala. Rarity dreams about meeting Princess Celestia's nephew\u00a0and falling in love with him. Fluttershy wants to visit the castle\u2019s gated garden and befriend the exotic animals who live there.\n When Twilight and Spike are eating lunch, they notice the other ponies go inside, while the waiter asks Twilight if she's going to eat in the rain, but she doesn't notice the rain until she sees that Rainbow Dash left a hole in a rain cloud to keep Twilight dry. Twilight tells her not to do favors in order to get the spare ticket. Rainbow Dash closes the hole and the rain drenches Twilight and Spike, ruining their lunch. Rarity passes by and invites them to Carousel Boutique where Rarity gives both of them makeovers. When Twilight realizes that she's doing it for the ticket she states that \"she will have to wait for her decision like everyone else.\" Afterwards, Applejack offers desserts to Twilight, but she declines. When she goes back to the library, she finds Fluttershy and her animal friends doing spring cleaning. When Twilight asks Fluttershy to leave, Pinkie pulls Twilight out and sings The Ticket Song. Pinkie inadvertently informs the whole town about the extra ticket to the gala. A crowd of excited ponies try to do favors for Twilight, and she escapes by teleporting herself and Spike back to the library.\n Twilight discovers her friends already waiting in the library and breaks down, telling them she doesn't want to disappoint anyone. The five friends apologize and say they don't want to go to the Gala anymore. Twilight writes a friendship report to Princess Celestia and decides to return both tickets because she'd rather not go than leave out any of her friends. Princess Celestia sends back six tickets, saying Twilight should have just asked for more. Twilight's stomach starts rumbling and the others invite her to dinner. As the ponies get their tickets, Spike becomes upset that he doesn't get a ticket, but Princess Celestia soon sends a seventh ticket for him. Spike goes outside with the ticket giggling, but he stops as soon as he sees Applejack grinning at him. He immediately pretends he is disgusted that he has to go, but soon runs off giggling as Applejack follows along."}, {"summary": "At Sweet Apple Acres, Applejack and Big McIntosh\u00a0survey the huge apple harvest awaiting them. With Big McIntosh injured, Applejack decides to harvest the crop of apples by herself, despite her brother's warning that it's a huge task for just one pony.\nWhen Applejack is bucking apple trees, she sees a herd of cows stampeding towards Ponyville. She diverts the stampede from Ponyville in the nick of time with the help of her dog Winona. Impressed by Applejack's loyalty and reliability, the citizens host a ceremony in her honor. Twilight Sparkle tries to give a speech, but she is interrupted by Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, and Fluttershy\u2014who express happiness at the prospect of working with Applejack on various tasks in the near future\u2014as well as Mayor Mare who steps up to deliver a short speech of her own. A visibly exhausted Applejack arrives late to the ceremony to collect her trophy. She has bags under her eyes and yawns frequently.\nLater on, Twilight goes to the apple farm to find Applejack. Applejack explains that \"Applebuck Season\" is when the apples must be harvested. When Twilight asks about her relatives, Applejack says that they only stayed at Sweet Apple Acres for the family reunion and are too busy harvesting their own crops. Twilight offers to help, but Applejack stubbornly refuses.\nApplejack, having promised to help out her friends, shows up late for her appointment with Rainbow Dash. Applejack's task is to jump from a platform onto one end of a catapult, launching Dash into the air to practice flips and spins. Her vision blurry from fatigue, Applejack keeps missing her end of the catapult. She lands on the catapult in one last attempt, but the unprepared Dash is sent flying and crash-lands on the Golden Oak Library balcony. Twilight guesses that Applejack is involved and returns to Sweet Apple Acres to offer help. Applejack has difficulty hearing after hitting her head on a branch, but still declines.Later, Applejack bakes muffins with Pinkie Pie at Sugarcube Corner while Mr. and Mrs. Cake are away. Applejack's fatigue causes her to misunderstand her friend's instruction, and she substitutes potato chips for chocolate chips, regular soda for baking soda, a cup of sour lemon juice for a cup of flour, and earthworms for wheat germ. When the muffins are baked, Pinkie Pie hands them out to a crowd of ponies, one of whom is Derpy. She exclaims \"Muffins!\", making it her first line on the show, though Minuette's and Sea Swirl's mouth movements also match the line.\nThe scene wipes into a sick-tent where many ponies lie sick from eating the baked goods, which Pinkie Pie calls \"baked bads.\" Spike, however, gleefully eats the discarded muffins, even one with a wriggling worm in it. Once more, Applejack refuses Twilight's help. Twilight is annoyed at Applejack for being \"as stubborn as a mule\", and says \"No offense\" to a nearby mule.For her final task, Applejack meets Fluttershy in the forest to help round up baby rabbits for Fluttershy's bunny census. Fluttershy tells Applejack to be gentle, but Applejack's rough attitude and Winona's barking frighten the bunnies. Applejack and Winona corner the terrified bunnies, who freak out and stampede into Ponyville, where they eat most of the town's plants, ruin the town\u2019s gardens, and make Fluttershy's census impossible to finish. Seeing this, Twilight decides enough is enough and goes to confront Applejack once and for all.At the orchard, Twilight tells Applejack that her stubbornness caused as many problems with her friends as with her and that she really needs help. Applejack thinks she's finally finished harvesting, but Big McIntosh arrives to point out that she has only harvested part of the apples. Applejack faints from shock and exhaustion. When she regains consciousness, Twilight tells her that, although she respects the Apple family ways, Applejack must put \"a little of [her] stubborn pride aside\".\nApplejack finally gives in and asks for her friends' help, which makes the harvesting more efficient. When the friends take a break, Applejack serves them apple juice, thanking them and apologizing for being so stubborn. Twilight realizes that it is just as okay to accept help from friends as it is to give help. Spike comes by to offer them the worm-filled muffins he found in the garbage, and the disgusted ponies walk off as the episode ends.\n"}, {"summary": "The episode starts with Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle spending time in a park, with Pinkie enthusiastically relating some story about Rainbow Dash's aerial acrobatics to Twilight, who is reading a book and not paying Pinkie much attention. Pinkie spots Rainbow flying up above and calls to her, but Dash tells her \"not now\". Pinkie pursues Dash and calls out to her, until Dash slams into a mountainside and slides down next to Pinkie, who tells her she was going to warn her about it.\n Pinkie Pie starts asking around Ponyville for the whereabouts of Rainbow Dash. Once she finds her, Dash tries to escape, but Pinkie Pie catches up with her instantly whenever she stops. After several failed hiding spots, Dash gives up and asks what she wants. Pinkie reveals that she was trying to find her so she could help in playing a prank on Spike. Using a nearby thundercloud, they wait for the baby dragon to exit the town square pavilion. Once Spike is out, upon a signal from Pinkie, Dash kicks the cloud to ignite a thunderous boom, scaring him. The scare causes him to hiccup repeatedly, making him breathe his magic fire at a set of scrolls and transporting them to an unsuspecting Princess Celestia.\n After making sure he is okay, the two commence a pranking spree on the rest of their friends. They use water colors on the apples in some of Applejack's apple trees, switch Twilight's pen ink with disappearing ink, and use sneezing powder on Rarity. The \"victims\" are annoyed but still amused by the good-natured practical jokes. At a nearby lake, when Pinkie learns that Dash sees Fluttershy as their target for a fake squirting turtle toy, she immediately stops her. She warns Dash that Fluttershy is too sensitive for even the most harmless of pranks. The two end the day by pranking each other instead.\n The next day, Pinkie Pie arrives wearing an arrow head band, a pair\u00a0of glasses with a red clown nose, a droopy mustache, and a party kazoo\u00a0near Rainbow Dash's cloud-house in the sky, where she meets Gilda, Dash's old griffon friend from Junior Speedster Flight Camp. Pinkie Pie has prepared another series of pranks for her and Dash to pull. Gilda reminds Dash about a promised flying session, and Dash excuses herself, promising to hang out with Pinkie Pie later. Pinkie accepts this, but as she tries to catch up to the two in the clouds later, Gilda intercepts her and tells her to buzz off now that she is around to keep Dash company.\nPinkie Pie goes to Twilight Sparkle at the library for advice about Gilda's mean behavior, but Twilight believes that Pinkie Pie is simply jealous of Gilda. The only advice she can give Pinkie is to try to improve her own attitude. Pinkie is upset at Twilight's refusal to take her side but reflects that maybe Twilight's assessment is true and enjoys a milkshake alone at Sugarcube Corner.\n Rainbow Dash and Gilda show up in town and, not noticing Pinkie Pie, part ways briefly so Rainbow Dash can attend to some weather jobs. When Pinkie observes Gilda scaring Granny Smith and stealing an apple from a produce stand, she tries her best to justify the situation. The last straw falls when the griffon roars at and drives to tears a well-meaning Fluttershy, who was guiding a family of ducks. Fluttershy flies away and passes two ponies on the way making strange faces, which an animator on the show described as a \"derpy-sorta look\".[11] Tired of the bird-lion's mean streak, Pinkie Pie vows to fix the problem \"Pinkie Pie-style.\" This entails throwing a welcoming party at Sugarcube Corner in Gilda's honor. At the party, the griffon is greeted by Pinkie's joy buzzer handshake. Gilda warns Pinkie that she knows what the pony is up to, but the latter simply brushes it aside and officially starts the party by having everyone in the party welcome Gilda. After the party starts, Gilda falls for most of the pranks set up for the party, to which she hides her growing irritation from the other ponies, including Dash.The griffon strongly suspects that Pinkie Pie was the mastermind behind the party pranks. The pink pony then preps the griffon for \"Pin the Tail on the Pony\". As she guides the guest of honor to the picture, Gilda suspects this is yet another prank and goes the other direction, resulting in slipping over a fallen piece of cake and having the 'tail on the other end'.\n Gilda finally loses her temper, calling all the attendees at the party \"dweebs\" and proclaiming Pinkie Pie as \"Queen Lame-o\" for setting up all the pranks. She then attempts to bail the party with Dash at her side, but Rainbow Dash doesn't move after seeing Gilda's true nature. To everyone's surprise, Rainbow Dash reveals that she is the one who set up all the pranks (not all meant for Gilda). Contrary to the bird's view of the party as a way to get back at her, Pinkie reveals that it was meant to improve the griffon's sour attitude. Disappointed over her old friend's mean behavior towards her new friends, Dash tells Gilda to go find some \"new cool friends someplace else\" if being cool is all she cares about. Rather than apologize for her behavior and having no proper response to this, Gilda calls Dash a 'flip-flop' and storms out, slamming the door behind her. Rainbow Dash then apologizes to the party attendees for Gilda's behavior, and she and Pinkie Pie make up with a joy buzzer handshake.\nTwilight Sparkle apologizes to Pinkie Pie for accusing her of misjudging Gilda, and learns that, rather than try to influence who your friends spend time with, you yourself should try to be a good friend, and trust that the true face of a false friend will eventually be revealed through their behavior. While sending her report at the end of the episode, Twilight plays a prank of her own by tricking Princess Celestia into trying to write with disappearing ink.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins in Golden Oak Library, where Twilight Sparkle successfully performs the last spell of a set of twenty-five. The spell, called \"growing magic\", gives Spike a mustache. Spike hopes to show it to Rarity, but Twilight says that it is just for practice and makes it disappear.\nLater, Twilight and Spike go for a stroll. Twilight says that most unicorns only have a little magic suited for their special talent. Spike points out that Twilight's talent is magic and praises her vast knowledge. However, Twilight modestly denies having more magical ability than any other pony in Equestria. Their conversation is cut short when Snips and Snails spread the word that a new unicorn with unrivaled powers has arrived in Ponyville.\n In the town square, a stage unfolds from a trailer as a booming voice announces the arrival of the \"The Great and Powerful Trixie\". Trixie claims to be the most magical unicorn in all of Equestria and sets off some fireworks, impressing the citizens. Twilight's friends, however, are unimpressed. Twilight asks if there is something wrong with being talented. Applejack and Rarity tell her that there is nothing wrong with talent, as long as you do not boast. When Spike tries to say that Twilight is more magical than Trixie, Twilight stops him, telling him that she doesn't want her friends to think she is boastful. When Rainbow Dash demands to know what makes Trixie so special, she claims that she once saved the town of Hoofington from an \"ursa major\" by sending it back to the Everfree Forest. She then challenges anyone in Ponyville to step up, saying that she can surpass anyone\u2019s abilities.\nApplejack accepts the challenge and performs a rodeo rope trick. Trixie makes the rope imitate a hypnotic snake that hog-ties Applejack. Rainbow Dash then gathers moisture from clouds to create a mini-rainbow, but Trixie uses magic to whirl the rainbow into a funnel and trap Rainbow Dash in it, spinning her around until she is dizzy. Rarity declines the challenge, saying that she is \"above all this nonsense\". But when Trixie insults her mane, she decides to demonstrate elegance by creating a costume out of stage curtains. Trixie uses her magic to turn Rarity's hair into a mottled slime-green mess with a stick and two rats' tails poking out of it. Rarity runs off in humiliation, crying, \u201cSuch an awful, awful color!\u201d A green-haired variation of Golden Harvest frowns and says, \u201cWell I never!\u201d Spike tries to convince Twilight to confront the arrogant unicorn. Trixie overhears him and challenges Twilight, but Twilight runs away. With no one left to face her, Trixie declares herself to be \u201cthe most amazing unicorn in all of Equestria.\u201d\n After the show, Snips and Snails deliver a smoothie to Trixie with extra hay, \"just how [she] likes it\". The colts want to hear how she defeated an ursa major, but Trixie brushes them off, telling them she\u2019s exhausted. A skeptical Spike meets the two colts, saying that proof is needed to verify Trixie's claim. Snips gets the idea of finding an ursa major in the Everfree Forest.\nBack at the library where Twilight is studying, Spike tries to convince her that she can use her magic to stand up to Trixie and help her friends. However, Twilight fears she would be no better than Trixie and might end up losing her friends by showing off. Spike is frustrated about the situation and leaves.\n In the forest, Snips and Snails find a giant blue bear in a dark cave, but they accidentally wake it up and lead it back to Ponyville. They wake up Trixie, who panics upon seeing the bear. The bear crushes Trixie's trailer after Trixie runs away with the two colts. After a few failed attempts to stop it, Trixie finally confesses that she had never vanquished an ursa major before.\nBefore the bear can wreak serious havoc on Ponyville, Twilight (who was alerted by Spike) finally uses her magic. Using the wind and cattails to play a lullaby, she soothes the creature. She levitates a water tower, fills it with milk by passing it through a barn full of cows, and feeds the milk to the bear. As the bear drifts off into a deep sleep, she magically carries it back to the forest.\n Twilight\u2019s friends dismiss Trixie as a loudmouth and praise Twilight\u2019s magical abilities. Twilight asks her friends if they mind her magic tricks, and Applejack reassures her that her magic is a part of who she is, and that they are proud to have such a powerful, talented unicorn as their friend. Twilight explains that the bear was actually an ursa minor, a younger version of the ursa major.\nRefusing to admit she was outdone, Trixie says that Twilight will never have the same \"amazing, show-stopping ability\" as she does. Trixie conjures a puff of smoke that poorly conceals her hasty departure from the town. Rainbow Dash prepares to go after Trixie, but Twilight stops her and says, \"Maybe someday she'll learn her lesson.\"\n Twilight orders Snips and Snails to clean up the area as punishment for luring the ursa minor into town. With Spike's encouragement, she gives them and Spike mustaches. Later, in the library, Twilight writes a friendship lesson to Princess Celestia that she should be proud of her magical talent, but also be aware of whether the situation is appropriate for magic. Twilight finally admits to Spike that she is the most talented unicorn in Ponyville, but \"it's nothing to brag about.\" Spike is disappointed that Rarity did not go for his new look. Twilight advises him to try being himself, but he starts fantasizing about sporting a matching beard.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode opens with Fluttershy giving food to some of the animals that live around her home. Fluttershy flies over to Angel, who is rapidly eating a carrot, and\u00a0tells him to slow down or else\u00a0he'll get a tummy ache. Angel drops the carrot and runs off. Fluttershy catches up to him and attempts\u00a0to convince him to eat more, but Angel refuses and kicks the carrot away. He\u00a0runs\u00a0a short distance\u00a0and\u00a0begins to cough,\u00a0and after several failed guesses from Fluttershy, he points out the cause:\u00a0an ominous cloud of black smoke heading towards Ponyville. Believing the smoke may be emerging from a possible fire, Fluttershy rushes over to warn everyone but fails to get their attention due to her soft voice and lack of assertiveness, and because the ponies in town are too occupied with their activities: Rainbow Dash trying\u00a0to break a ball-bouncing record, Pinkie Pie organizing\u00a0a celebration for when said record is broken, and other ponies\u00a0conversing amongst themselves. Only when Twilight arrives are\u00a0the other ponies alerted to the smoke.\nThe main characters gather inside Golden Oak Library, where Twilight relays news from Princess Celestia: The smoke in question is not coming from a fire, but from a sleeping dragon. Celestia warns that if the dragon is not convinced to leave, the smoke from his snoring could easily blanket Equestria for the next hundred years. Twilight and her friends are tasked with taking care of the problem.\n There's a short montage where Twilight's friends prepare for their journey, which is heavily influenced by 1970s and '80s action television shows and films. Rainbow Dash stripes a red, yellow and green pattern onto her cheeks, Applejack packs money and apples, Pinkie Pie has sunglasses and balloons exploding from her bag (she giggles then says \"I mean GRRRRRRRRR\"), Rarity puts on a big hat with khaki coloring and Fluttershy comes out of her house wearing a football helmet, water wings and various other sports equipment, then jumps when the door closes. The group rendezvouses near the mountain the dragon has occupied. Fluttershy, who has exhibited very little enthusiasm for going after the dragon, tries to back out of the mission, and Rainbow Dash concurs, pointing out Fluttershy's timidness and worrying that she might slow them down, something she does repeatedly throughout the episode. However, Twilight Sparkle insists that the Pegasus' talent of interacting with wild animals could be useful. Spike remains behind to look over the critters that Fluttershy usually takes care of, over her objections.\n Initially, Rainbow Dash's skepticism seems justified. Upon hearing the dragon's distant snoring, Fluttershy's limbs lock up, rendering her unable to fly. Another snore makes her stiffly fall to the side, accompanied by a goat bleat, alluding to the tendency of some breeds of goat to stiffen after being startled. Applejack is forced to drag her the long way around to catch up to the other ponies. Later, after her ability to move on her own has returned, she still has trouble leaping over a narrow chasm, having to be encouraged by one of Pinkie Pie's songs; and a leaf falling on her back makes her cry out, inadvertently causing a rock slide that almost buries them and further extends their journey.\nThey do eventually reach their destination: the cave where the dragon is resting. Twilight wants to go in with Fluttershy, in the hope that between the two of them, they can convince the dragon to leave. But Fluttershy says she is scared of fully-grown dragons. After a failed attempt to cheer Fluttershy on, her friends decide to finish the job without her.\n Twilight tries to reason with the dragon, but is completely ignored. Then, Rarity tries to use her charm on it, but fails when she tries to lay claim to the dragon's jewels. Pinkie Pie enters the dragon's cave in a funny costume with balloons, flippers, giant glasses, and a party blower, but exits without success. Her costume is similar to Daffy Duck's body in a scene from the Looney Tunes cartoon Duck Amuck. All Rainbow Dash's brute force attempt accomplishes is making the dragon angry: it steps outside the cave and begins attacking the ponies. In the process, the ponies get knocked over, and Fluttershy's hiding place is destroyed, exposing her to the dragon.\nLooking at her dazed friends, she gains enough courage to fly up to the dragon and admonish him for what she calls his bullying. Cowed by Fluttershy's tone, the dragon tries to justify his anger by explaining that Rainbow Dash kicked him. Much to Rainbow Dash's confusion, Fluttershy apologizes for Dash's attack on the dragon, but also says that the dragon is bigger than the ponies and should be more considerate. She also admonishes him for sleeping in a place where his snoring could endanger the health of other creatures. The dragon weakly attempts to argue back, but Fluttershy won't let him. After being scolded so harshly that he bursts into tears, Fluttershy comforts him and convinces him to leave. The dragon leaves the mountain, and Fluttershy's friends congratulate her for standing up to him.\n The episode cuts to Ponyville, where Spike is struggling to keep Angel in check. Twilight Sparkle relays a message to Princess Celestia that the mission was a success, and that she learned to never lose faith in her friends. Outside the library the main characters watch Rainbow Dash once again trying to beat the ball-bouncing record. Pinkie plays a prank on her and imitates a dragon's roar, which makes Rainbow briefly lock up in fear in a similar way to Fluttershy earlier in the episode. Still, the two Pegasi's roles are not entirely reversed; when Rainbow Dash blows another stray leaf onto Fluttershy's back, she freezes up and faints. The episode ends with the main characters laughing at the frozen Fluttershy.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode opens in a field outside the Golden Oak Library; several Pegasi are seen moving clouds into place to create a downpour. In preparation for this, trees are being pruned to avoid damaging the town. Rarity helps out, but her contribution to the cleanup effort involves making topiary out of the loose branches. This puts her at odds with Applejack, who insists on taking the branches down. When Rarity voices her disapproval of Applejack making a mess, rain starts to fall, much to Rarity's further displeasure.\nApplejack suggests that Rarity use a bench to shield herself from the rain, but Rarity refuses out of an unwillingness to get her hooves muddy. As the two argue even more over their situation, the rain and wind pick up speed. Twilight Sparkle, noticing the two caught in the storm, offers them shelter in the library until the storm passes.\n With Spike away in Canterlot on royal business, Twilight is alone for the evening, and sees this as an opportunity to have her very first slumber party. Rarity and Applejack are far from eager to spend the entire evening in each other's company, but find themselves unable to leave due to the worsening storm. After a brief argument about mud masks, they agree to try and get along so they don't ruin Twilight's first sleepover.\nTwilight is oblivious to Applejack and Rarity's silent bickering, checking off each game in her book as they're played. However, for each game played, the two grow more and more frustrated with each other.\n During ghost stories, Rarity and Applejack suggest stories that allude to why they don't like each other before Twilight tells the legend of The Headless Horse, succeeding in scaring both of her friends. Applejack sickens Rarity by burping when they make s'mores. And in a game of Truth or Dare, Applejack and Rarity only dare each other to do humiliating things, such as Applejack daring Rarity to get her mane wet in the rain and Rarity daring Applejack to wear a gaudy, ridiculous outfit.\nTwilight, now sensing conflict, tries to move things along. Unfortunately, the conflict comes to a head during the next game: a pillow fight, which in no time turns into an all-out pillow war between Rarity and Applejack. Caught in the middle and bombarded with pillows, Twilight suggests that they call it a night and go to bed.\n Applejack and Rarity's petty arguing continues even when the ponies try to go to bed. Exasperated by their constant back and forth, Twilight at last decides to intervene and voices how upset she is that her friends are fighting too much to have any fun, thereby ruining her slumber party. Just as Twilight asks if anything else could possibly go wrong, a nearby tree is hit by lightning and begins to topple towards a neighboring house.\nApplejack, not heeding a warning from Rarity, lassos the falling tree and instead of stabilizing it, sends it crashing through Twilight's bedroom window. Rarity focuses on cleaning up the mess of books and Applejack tries to push the tree back out of the window while Twilight desperately searches through her slumber party book for a section on dealing with fallen trees in the middle of the bedroom.\n When Applejack fails at moving the tree out on her own, she eventually apologizes to Rarity for criticizing her attention to detail and convinces her to focus on helping with the bigger task instead. She gets Rarity to not worry so much about getting her hooves dirty. Rarity uses her unicorn magic to turn the treetop into tiny bush sculptures, clearing the house at the cost of getting dirt all over herself. Applejack, at Rarity's insistence, proceeds to gently toss the broken tree trunk out of the window.\nWith the storm, and their differences, finally settled, Applejack, Rarity, and Twilight are finally able to have fun, rounding out the evening with a game of 20 Questions. Applejack and Rarity exchange apologies, and in the end, Twilight officially declares the slumber party a success, to her friends' delight.\n In a letter to Princess Celestia, Twilight writes that it's possible to get along with someone very different from you if you embrace each other's differences. She proposes another slumber party the following night, and her proposal is met by two pillows thrown in her face. The episode closes as the sky clears up, revealing a bright sunny day."}, {"summary": "Twilight Sparkle and Spike arrive in Ponyville's town square to find the town completely deserted. While they speculate about where everyone could be, Pinkie Pie fervently calls to them from Sugarcube Corner, telling them to get inside before \"she\" gets them. Inside, they find Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Rarity, and Fluttershy, who nervously explain that they are hiding from a strange hooded creature named Zecora. The only pony not scared is Applejack's younger sister Apple Bloom, also present. According to the other ponies, no one in Ponyville knows what Zecora's reasons for visiting the town are, except that she does so monthly. They also know that she lives in the Everfree Forest, a self-preserving environment which is almost alien to Ponyville. After seeing her pull her hood down, Twilight concludes that Zecora is a zebra and not an \"odd-looking pony\". The gray and white in her strange mane are really her natural colors. According to books Twilight has read, Zecora's species is from \"a far away land\". Pinkie Pie shares a song with the others, profiling Zecora as an \"Evil Enchantress\".\u00a0\nWhile the ponies are busy discussing Zecora's nature, Apple Bloom decides to approach Zecora herself and slips out of the bakery. She follows Zecora to the Everfree Forest. Upon noticing Apple Bloom's absence, the other ponies decide to leave the house to search for her.\n They find Apple Bloom when she is just behind Zecora, who is surrounded by many blue flowers. The zebra retreats to the forest, giving them a brief warning: \"Beware! Beware, you pony folk! Those leaves of blue are not a joke!\" Applejack scoops Apple Bloom off the ground while the other ponies, save Twilight and Fluttershy, taunt the zebra and ignore her warning. On their way back, Twilight tries to explain to her friends the difference between magic and Zecora's \"curses\" but to no avail. Twilight classifies the \"curses\" as harmless and fictional \"pony tales\". However, Applejack warns her that some \"pony tales\" are indeed true. As the ponies leave the forest, they all trot through the \"blue flowers\" except for Apple Bloom, who is carried out on Applejack's back.\nDuring the night, Twilight dreams about Zecora and her friends' warnings of her evil. The next morning, Twilight wakes up after recalling everything her friends said about the strange zebra. As she brushes her hair, she is shocked to find her horn turned soft, wobbly, and covered in blue spots. She frantically searches for a book\u00a0containing a way to fix her problem, or at least provide information on it, but she cannot find anything useful. Spike finds a book called Supernaturals that she may have overlooked, but she insists that there's no need to even open it because it details superstitions or other useless information. Her friends arrive at the library, each with an ailment of their own. Pinkie Pie's now blue-spotted tongue is swollen to the point of hanging out of her mouth, and she can't speak intelligibly or without spitting. Rainbow Dash's wings have been inverted and moved from her back to her lower sides, preventing her from flying properly and causing her to crash constantly. Rarity's mane and tail are messy and her coat has grown so long that she cannot see or walk properly. Applejack has drastically shrunken in size and has to ride on Apple Bloom just to get to the library. Fluttershy is afflicted with a deep-sounding male voice. Spike laughs himself silly at the ponies and, in making good-natured fun of their misfortune, makes up nicknames for each pony:\nSpike, however, can't immediately think of a proper name to make fun of Twilight's wobbly horn.\n The ponies, with the exception of Twilight, conclude that Zecora has \"cursed\" or \"hexed\" them, and they resolve to confront her in the forest in hopes of finding a cure. But Apple Bloom, the only one that was not afflicted, believes she alone is to blame for the ponies' ailments and ventures ahead to find Zecora. As Apple Bloom leaves, Applejack wonders aloud where she is going and jumps into her tail. When the others notice Applejack is missing, they first worriedly check to see if they've stepped or sat on her. Upon realizing that Apple Bloom is also gone, the ponies realize she must have gone after Zecora again and set out in search of her. As the ponies leave, Fluttershy asks Spike if he is coming along, but he makes up an alibi to stay there to look for a cure. He manages to think up a joke-like nickname for Twilight Sparkle: \"Twilight Flopple\".\nOn her way through the Everfree Forest, Applejack reveals herself in Apple Bloom's mane and orders her to turn around. Apple Bloom refuses and, realizing that her diminutive older sister can't stop her, places her on a tree branch she can't get down from before continuing on her way. When the others enter the forest later, Rainbow Dash crashes into the tree Applejack was left in, accidentally catching the tiny pony in her mouth. Applejack pulls herself out and quickly fashions a bit and reins from leaves, a stick, and some vine. She throws it on Rainbow Dash and, climbing onto her chest, helps to steer her in the right direction.\n When the others finally reach Zecora's hut, they watch through her window as she mixes a strange concoction in her cauldron, chanting something in an unknown language. Pinkie gets Fluttershy to sing her \"Evil Enchantress\" song to point out that Zecora fits the profile in it. Twilight starts to wonder whether Zecora might be \"bad\" after all. When she overhears the zebra mentioning Apple Bloom, she concludes that Zecora is preparing a soup to eat her with. The four ponies scream in horror. Rainbow Dash and Applejack barge in and the other ponies follow suit in a rescue attempt, upsetting the cauldron and spilling its contents onto the floor. The hut is further wrecked by Rainbow Dash's uncoordinated flying. As the ponies loudly confront Zecora about her \"curse\", Apple Bloom arrives from behind them with packed saddle bags and tells them she is assisting Zecora by gathering ingredients. They both reveal that the brew Zecora had been making is a remedy for poison joke, a poison ivy-like plant that causes \"laughable\" results to anyone who touches it. They had never been cursed but had been affected by the blue plants, and were too stubborn to heed Zecora's warning the previous day when they saw her. The cure is from one of Zecora's books, another copy of the book that Spike found in the library. Twilight admits she didn't bother looking past its weird title. It turns out that the Supernaturals in the book's title were natural remedies and cure-alls that are simply super. After apologizing to Zecora for not bothering to \"look inside\", Twilight asks if Zecora could make another batch of the remedy. Zecora is happy to do so, but she tells Twilight they need a herb from Ponyville, which she could not obtain because the shops are always mysteriously closed.\n The ponies escort Zecora back to town, where the other ponies are still afraid of her. Twilight talks to the concerned ponies and the scene cuts to the main characters having a bath at the spa, with Twilight giving her friendship report in a voiceover. One of the spa ponies asks Zecora for the recipe of her \"luxurious\" herbal bath, and the episode ends with all the ponies cured of their poison joke afflictions, after briefly panicking over not finding Applejack."}, {"summary": " The episode begins in a field near the Everfree Forest, where Fluttershy is gathering flowers for Princess Celestia\u2019s visit to Ponyville. A small creature that Fluttershy has never seen before appears. She offers it an apple, but it devours a bucketful of apples despite its small size. Fluttershy is surprised, but she adopts the creature and plans on showing it to her friends.\nThe rest of Ponyville is also preparing for the Princess's arrival. Twilight Sparkle tells Spike that the library has to be spotless, and everything has to be perfect. Twilight goes to check on the rest of the preparations. In Sugarcube Corner, she catches Pinkie Pie eating cakes and other sweets that Mr. and Mrs. Cake have made for the Princess. Pinkie Pie says that she is sampling the sweets to ensure their quality. Fluttershy enters the bakery to show Twilight and Pinkie Pie the creature she found, but inexplicably, two more of the same creatures pop out. Twilight adopts one of them so Spike can have a companion. Pinkie Pie, however, reacts in disgust, calling them \"parasprites.\" She says that she needs a trombone and leaves the bakery.\nIn Carousel Boutique, Rarity is putting the finishing touches on Rainbow Dash's elaborate dress. Twilight enters and praises Rarity's dresses that she designed specially for the royal visit. When Twilight takes out her parasprite, she discovers that she is carrying not one, but three of them. Rarity and Rainbow Dash gladly adopt the extra parasprites.\n The next day, Twilight Sparkle and Spike are shocked to find their house filled with parasprites. The parasprites are impossible to control and they freely destroy books and parchments. Meanwhile, in Rainbow Dash's home in Cloudsdale, Rainbow Dash's parasprites cling to her body, driving her mad. Rarity is fond of her helpful swarm until she witnesses the parasprites\u2019 unsightly method of reproduction; namely, coughing up/vomiting new parasprites. Even Fluttershy has lost control over the swarm in her house. Twilight realizes that if the situation isn\u2019t handled immediately, Celestia's visit will be a disaster. Meanwhile, Pinkie Pie is busy gathering an assortment of musical instruments, including a harmonica, a banjo, and a pair of maracas. Her friends assume she is just being random and disregard her efforts to collect more instruments.\nApplejack directs her friends in an attempt to round up the parasprites. The ponies succeed in driving the parasprites into the Everfree Forest. Unfortunately, when the friends head back to Fluttershy's house, a dense swarm of parasprites bursts out. Fluttershy admits that she had kept a parasprite because she couldn't help herself. Rainbow Dash steps up to the plate by creating a tornado that sucks in the parasprites. Everything is working until Pinkie Pie walks up to them, sporting a pair of cymbals. The cymbals are drawn into the tornado; Rainbow Dash tries to dodge them, but they break her concentration and the tornado falls apart. The parasprite horde flies into Ponyville and the friends run after them, ignoring Pinkie's attempt to explain why she was gathering the instruments in the first place.\nThe ponies watch in horror as the parasprites begin to eat all the food in town. Twilight casts a spell to stop the parasprites from consuming food. However, the parasprites start devouring everything that isn't food: signposts, lamps, Rarity's dresses, and even the words from Twilight's books. Twilight brings a parasprite to Zecora's house in the Everfree Forest, hoping the zebra can find a solution. Zecora easily recognizes the parasprite, but even she doesn't know how to get rid of them. Twilight returns to Ponyville and sees that Princess Celestia is approaching the town. Frantic and almost hysterical, Twilight begins to formulate a plan to build a replica of Ponyville next to the real one before the Princess's arrival, but Celestia's royal procession appears on the horizon.\n When all seems lost, Pinkie Pie shows up with a one-pony band, playing the instruments she gathered. Twilight suspected this to be another one of her games, but she and her friends watch as the parasprites become attracted to the music and follow the \"Pinkie Pied Piper\" out of Ponyville.\nAt the town's outskirts, the friends meet Princess Celestia, who thinks the orderly, bouncing parasprites are part of a parade in her honor. She informs Twilight that she needs to cancel her Ponyville visit to deal with an infestation of some \"incredibly bothersome creatures\" in Fillydelphia. Celestia asks Twilight if she would like to give a report on friendship before she leaves. Twilight tells her mentor that the solutions to one's problems can come from unlikely sources, and that it's a good idea to listen to your friends' opinions and perspectives, even if they don't seem to make any sense. Commenting on how impressed she is with Twilight Sparkle and her friends, Celestia takes off.\nThe friends apologize to Pinkie Pie for not listening to her. Twilight tells her that she is a great friend even though they don't always understand her, and thank her for saving Ponyville. The friends walk back to Ponyville, and the episode ends when Pinkie Pie comically plays a trombone to express their dismay at the ruins.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins in\u00a0Golden Oak Library, where an eager Twilight Sparkle awakens ready to take part in this activity and is willing to keep with tradition by not using her unicorn magic. Spike is annoyed about losing sleep over his friend's excitement. Twilight tells Spike that Ponyville was founded by the Earth ponies, and as such, no magic was ever involved in the Winter Wrap Up, an annual \"spring cleaning\" community event where winter ends and spring is introduced. In this case, the ponies literally clean up winter to prepare for spring. Twilight checks off everything (even Spike complaining and going back to sleep) before heading outside, only to discover that it's not even dawn yet.\nIn the morning, with a sleepy Spike on her back, Twilight arrives at the center of\u00a0Ponyville where the Mayor finishes her final speech before the cleanup is divided into three teams: Weather, Animals, and Plants, all wearing Rarity-designed vests of blue, tan, and green respectively. However, Twilight is unable to find an appropriate team to work with and sings about it. She volunteers to help Weather Team leader Rainbow Dash and her flight crew, but she is gently reminded that she has no wings to fly with. Twilight finds Animal Team member and official nest designer Rarity outside the Carousel Boutique, just as she finishes her first nest. Rarity explains that she is nest-weaving for the birds being guided back from the south. Twilight tries her hoof at it, but the one she makes is messy. Twilight leaves to find another line of work while Rarity tries to fix Twilight's nest.\n Twilight and Spike then run into Weather Team member Pinkie Pie on one of the frozen lakes, where they find out Pinkie has been an expert skater ever since she was young. She is tasked with scoring the ice so that it will melt more easily when the Weather Team Pegasi clear away the clouds. Twilight tries to help, but it's her first time on skates and she lacks the balance and finesse to ice skate without falling. After Twilight causes them both to crash into a snow bank, Pinkie Pie suggests that Fluttershy could probably use a hand with the critters.\nNext, Twilight tries to assist Animal Team member Fluttershy with waking all the animals from hibernation. She seems to have an easy job ahead of her, until she is scared by a den of snakes. Panicked, she backs away into a cave of bats, gets stung by bees, and is sprayed by skunks. While Twilight is busy bathing in tomato juice at home, Spike suggests that she should break her \"no-magic\" promise so her work would be easier, but Twilight refuses.\n That changes when she helps Plant Team leader Applejack and the plant team with clearing the snow from the fields, with one-pony-powered snow plows in order to prepare for seed planting. Twilight wants to man a plow, but Applejack hesitates; she soon relents when Twilight asks to give her a chance. However, despite her best efforts, Twilight is unable to push the snow plow. Twilight decides to use a \"come-to-life\" spell to move the plow. Unfortunately, the spell soon goes out of control, resulting in an even bigger mess than before. Applejack berates Twilight for her use of magic, and Twilight runs off in tears.\n With no options left, Twilight hides in a bush in the town square refusing to come out, but she soon overhears that no one else in Ponyville is faring much better. Applejack wants Rainbow Dash's weather Pegasi to get the snow quickly melted for seeding, but Fluttershy wants Rainbow Dash to wait until she can clear the animal homes beforehand. The ice covering the lakes is not melting quickly enough due to poor scoring. Rarity was so focused on fixing Twilight's nest all day that she hasn't made more, and she was supposed to have finished several hundred by now. Big McIntosh leads Caramel to Applejack, who guesses correctly that he has lost the grass seeds again, and Rainbowshine tells Rainbow Dash that Ditzy Doo has gone north to guide back the southern birds. The mayor laments that her motivational speech from earlier had fallen on deaf ears. It appears that Ponyville will finish their Winter Wrap Up late, just like every past year, and it will soon be sunset. At this point, Twilight remembers her one other talent besides magic: organization. She breaks up the argument and volunteers to guide everyone in their tasks.\n\n With careful planning, teamwork, and everyone working through the night, the residents of Ponyville are finally able to finish their work on time. A montage of the successful, organized Winter Wrap Up is shown to an instrumental version of the Winter Wrap Up tune. Thanks to her exceptional organizing and leadership skills, Twilight is designated the new position of 'All-Team Organizer' by the Mayor, along with a new and unique vest by Rarity that incorporates the colors of all three teams. Mayor Mare declares winter wrapped up on time, and the ponies celebrate their accomplishment. They share a laugh at Spike afterward, who's fallen asleep on an ice floe, blissfully unaware of the predicament he's currently in.\nTwilight Sparkle relays her report to Princess Celestia, learning that everyone has hidden talents, and if they're patient and diligent, they'll find them. She also learned that everyone can accomplish anything when they work together and treat each other as friends. Before she can send her report, however, a cold-ridden Spike drops off to sleep; Twilight laughs it off.\n"}, {"summary": " In the Ponyville Schoolhouse, Cheerilee begins a lesson on cutie marks. She explains that her cutie mark, a trio of smiling flowers, represents her wish for her students to bloom and learn cheerfully. She asks the class when a pony\u2019s cutie mark appears, and Twist answers that it appears when the pony discovers what makes him or her special. Diamond Tiara whispers to Apple Bloom and passes her a note. Cheerilee catches Apple Bloom passing the note and finds it to be blank. Diamond Tiara quips, \"Remind you of anypony?\" and Apple Bloom sheepishly looks down at her blank flank.\nAfter class, Twist invites Apple Bloom to various activities, but Apple Bloom, who appears downcast, declines. Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon show up and start teasing Apple Bloom and Twist for not having cutie marks, calling them \"blank flanks.\" They invite the blank flanks to Diamond Tiara's \"cute-cea\u00f1era\", which Diamond Tiara says is \"a party celebrating me and my fantastic cutie mark.\"\n The scene cross-fades to the Sweet Apple Acres orchards. Applejack reassures Apple Bloom, telling her that every pony gets their cutie mark eventually. Applejack says that Granny Smith, Big McIntosh, and herself were all the last ponies in their class to get their cutie marks. Apple Bloom is upset about this, believing that the delay \"runs in the family.\u201d She excitedly repeats the phrase and concludes that her special talent, like those of her family, must be related to apples.\nIn the town square, Applejack and Apple Bloom have set up an apple stand. Apple Bloom\u2019s sales pitch is \"You can eat 'em, play with 'em, create fine art for your home with 'em!\" but her antics only annoy nearby ponies. She aggressively badgers Dr. Hooves into buying apples. Apple Bloom excitedly checks her flank, but no cutie mark is there. She becomes determined to \"increase her sales figures\". She frightens away Berryshine by snarling \"YOU TOUCH IT, YOU BUY IT!\" She then loads Sweetie Drops\u2019s bag with apples and accuses her of taking them, then demands four bits. Applejack apologizes to the ponies and tells Apple Bloom to not force her cutie mark to appear. Applejack ends up filling Sweetie Drops's bags with apples and gives her a bonus basket of apples, all for free.\n Following Applejack\u2019s suggestion, Apple Bloom goes to Twist and asks her if she wants to go to Diamond Tiara's cute-cea\u00f1era together since they both don't have a cutie mark. However, Twist has already gotten her cutie mark after discovering that making sweets is her \"super-special talent.\" Silver Spoon and Diamond Tiara walk by and continue to tease Apple Bloom for having a blank flank. The scene cuts to a gloomy Apple Bloom sitting by a well. Rainbow Dash shows up and pushes away a literal dark cloud over Apple Bloom's head. After listening to Apple Bloom\u2019s complaints, Rainbow Dash claims that she can make the cutie mark appear. She tells Apple Bloom that she was the first in her class to earn her cutie mark after discovering her \"need for speed.\"\n The scene cross-fades to Apple Bloom doing exercises, and Rainbow Dash tells her that the key is \"to try as many things as possible as\u00a0quickly\u00a0as possible.\u201d Apple Bloom tries juggling, hang-gliding, karate, kite-flying, and \"Ultrapony Roller Derby\", but she fails at each of these. After the sports montage, Rainbow Dash and Apple Bloom are resting when Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon walk by. Apple Bloom ducks into a bush to hide from them. As Rainbow Dash reviews a list of sports and activities, Pinkie Pie shows up and suggests that Apple Bloom might be good at eating cupcakes.\n Apple Bloom thanks Rainbow Dash and the scene wipes to Sugarcube Corner, where Apple Bloom volunteers to help Pinkie make some cupcakes. Pinkie sings the Cupcake Song to teach her how to make cupcakes. During the song, Pinkie cartoonishly appears in multiple places at once and pops out from behind unexpected places, like a ceiling lamp.\nApple Bloom takes a tray of burnt cupcakes out of the oven, and Pinkie Pie comments that \"those look much better than the last batch.\" Apple Bloom decides she's not cut out to be a baker and whines at the idea of being a blank flank forever. Pinkie Pie points to something on Apple Bloom's flank, but it turns out to be just a smudge of flour.\nTwilight Sparkle enters the bakery and Pinkie offers her some burnt cupcakes, which she declines. Apple Bloom asks Twilight to use magic to make her cutie mark appear, but Twilight tells her she has to discover it on her own. Apple Bloom begs her, and she reluctantly agrees. Each of the cutie marks that Twilight conjure last for only a fraction of a second. Twilight gives up and says:\n The scene cuts to Apple Bloom at the cute-cea\u00f1era at Sugarcube Corner. She ducks under a table with a long tablecloth and carries it to the exit. As she tries to sneak out, she bumps into Applejack, who unwittingly pushes her all the way back into the room. When Silver Spoon and Diamond Tiara spot Apple Bloom, she grabs a tablecloth and turns it into a dress to hide her flank. She lies and says that she got her cutie mark earlier. When Diamond Tiara calls her bluff, Apple Bloom claims she didn\u2019t want to outshine Diamond Tiara at her own cute-cea\u00f1era. Unfortunately, she stumbles over her dress and bumps into a phonograph, which makes the needle loudly scratch the record, drawing the attention of the guests. When Silver Spoon and Diamond Tiara point out Apple Bloom\u2019s exposed blank flank, Scootaloo calls out from under a table: \"You got a problem with blank flanks?\" Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle come out from under the table and defend Apple Bloom, saying she's full of potential and could become anything. \nTwilight says they're three very lucky fillies who have yet to discover who they are. The guests crowd around the three fillies and Diamond Tiara is aggravated because she's not getting all the attention.\n Scootaloo, Sweetie Belle, and Apple Bloom introduce themselves to each other, and they discuss the formation of a secret society dedicated to getting their cutie marks. They agree on the name \u201cthe Cutie Mark Crusaders\u201d. The episode ends with a voiceover of Twilight's friendship report, which starts with Twilight's narration and ends with Princess Celestia's narration, fading out on a shot of Celestia\u2019s cutie mark, a stylized sun.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins at Sweet Apple Acres during a game of horseshoes. Applejack bests Rainbow Dash by a ringer. While the farm pony assures her that it was all in good fun, Rainbow Dash says she hates losing. She challenges her friend to an Iron Pony competition, a series of sports contests, to decide who's the best athlete. Pinkie Pie and Rarity are spectators, Twilight Sparkle is the events' judge, Spike acts as announcer, and Fluttershy tallies the scores.\nApplejack completes the first event, the barrel weave, in 17 seconds, but receives a five-second penalty for bumping into one of the barrels. Rainbow Dash brushes through flawlessly in 18 seconds, earning one point.\nIn the Strength Test, Rainbow Dash bucks the hammer hard enough to hit the bell at the top, but Applejack kicks the hammer hard enough to break it and send the bell flying, earning her a point. She credits her prowess to \"years\u00a0of applebuckin'.\" and kicks the tree Dash is sitting underneath. Apples fall on Dash's head to the tune of Shave and a Haircut.\nThe goal of the next test, the Bronco Buck, is to buck Spike off in the shortest amount of time; Rainbow Dash wins this round. In Calf Roping, the contestants must lasso Spike; Applejack easily does this as Rainbow Dash accidentally ties herself to a tree branch. In the next round, Rainbow Dash beats Applejack at balancing and bouncing balls. Applejack brings the score back to 3-3 by shot-putting a bale of hay a further distance. Rainbow Dash wins the arm-wrestle, and Applejack bucks a football much further (4-4). Halfway through the competition, the ponies are tied 5-5, and most of Ponyville has joined the spectator stands.\nRefusing to lose, Rainbow Dash starts winning more events by using her wings. She briefly flaps her wings to win a grueling push-up contest, propels herself forward in the Long Jump to gain a few more inches, and carries a flock of baby chicks on her outstretched wings in a race across some mud. In the last event, a game of tug of war, Rainbow Dash flies up and tricks Applejack into talking and thus letting go of the rope. Applejack falls into the mud pit. With a staggering 15-5, Rainbow Dash \"wins\" the competition. Applejack calls out her friend for cheating with her wings. Rainbow Dash brings up the fact that she never said not to use her wings, but Applejack responds that she shouldn't have to. The farm pony challenges her to the annual Running of the Leaves, under the condition that she does not use her wings at all. Rainbow Dash accepts the terms.\n After Applejack and Rainbow Dash agree to race in the Running of the Leaves, the scene cuts to black and fades to Twilight and Spike walking to the race. Spike mentions he wants to be the race's announcer, but the frame pans to Pinkie Pie in the Twinkling Balloon, who has already taken the role of announcer. She explains that the competition is one of Ponyville's traditions and its purpose is to shake the autumn leaves off the trees with the pounding of footsteps. Several numbered competitors feature in the episode:\n Pinkie Pie invites Spike to join her in commentating. As the racers gather at the starting line, Applejack makes sure Rainbow Dash will keep good on her promise by tying her wings up. To their surprise, Twilight Sparkle joins the race to experience it herself, giving them the opportunity to mock their \"egghead\" friend. They are deeply amused by the fact that she has never run a race but has read on the subject. The marathon begins and Rainbow Dash and Applejack are already leading, determined to win once and for all. They are neck and neck before Applejack trips over a rock. She immediately accuses her rival of intentionally tripping her. With the exception of Twilight Sparkle, who is casually strolling behind and enjoying the scenery, the rest of the ponies rush past her. Twilight informs her that she didn't look where she was going, and Applejack dashes off to make up for lost time. Later, Rainbow Dash slows to a comfortable trot, confident of her lead, but Applejack runs past her. This time, the Pegasus trips over a stump and falls second-to-last next to Twilight Sparkle. She reminds Rainbow Dash that this is just a game. Too stubborn to believe that her apple-bucking friend would never stoop to such acts, Rainbow Dash decides to play dirty. Pinkie Pie and Spike still narrate from above.\nCatching up to Applejack, the two use the environment of the White Tail Woods to their advantage, from branches to bees to tree syrup. Along the way, Rainbow Dash flips an arrow sign, which points Applejack to a dead-end up a nearby mountain. All the racers after Applejack continue on the original path and run past Rainbow Dash while she leans on the sign laughing. When Twilight stops by, she mentions that all the other racers just ran past her. Dash runs off to get back in the race. Meanwhile, Applejack reaches the mountain summit and realizes Dash tricked her. Pinkie Pie offers her a lift in the Twinkling Balloon.\n As they approach the home stretch, Applejack and Rainbow fight harder than ever before to finish first. When the finish line is in sight, they start deliberately bumping into each other sideways. In the resulting tussle, Applejack accidentally unties Rainbow Dash's ropes, allowing her to break her promise at the last second and fly. Applejack intercepts her and they fight all the way to the finishing line. They start arguing about who finished first, but to their shock, their constant clash and mutual obstruction had caused them to fall behind and tie for the last place. Even Twilight got fifth place, and she explains that she followed the advice from her books and paced herself throughout the race, before going all-out when most of the racers were worn out. Twilight says this is a good result for a first-time racer.\nAs Rainbow Dash and Applejack feel sorry for their own embarrassingly poor sportsmanship, Princess Celestia steps forward. The Princess was watching the entire event as fall is one of her favorite seasons. She forgives them, saying that anybody can get swept up in the competitive spirit. She points out that the two missed some of the leaf-laden trees. Realizing that friendship is more important than any competition, the two last-place racers run off together to finish off the rest of the trees.\n"}, {"summary": "The episode begins with a shot of the Carousel Boutique, which cuts to Rarity levitating a dress illustration and telling Opalescence about her \"stunning new gown\" for the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot.

Twilight asks her to fix a button on her dress for the Gala.\nRarity insists on making Twilight a new dress instead and offers to spruce up Applejack's \"work duds\" as well. Rainbow Dash comes crashing into the room from above and knocks over some mannequins. Rarity exclaims \"I-de-a!\" in a sing-song voice and offers to make Dash, Pinkie Pie, and Fluttershy dresses for the Gala too, and they decide to hold a fashion show with their new dresses. Applejack questions whether Rarity can handle the workload, but Rarity laughs at the idea. The scene cross-fades to the song Art of the Dress, during which Rarity makes her friends' dresses.\n After the song, Rarity leads her friends into the boutique with eyes closed, then shows them their new outfits. She proudly describes how each dress matches the pony it's for, and asks, \"Aren't they all amazing?\" The ponies stand awkwardly in silence, then struggle for words; Applejack says. \"They sure are... sumth'n\", Twilight agrees \"Yes! Something.\", Pinkie Pie says \"I love something. Something is my favorite\" with an awkward smile, and Fluttershy sadly says \"It's... nice.\" Rarity presses the ponies for their honest opinion, and they all agree that the dresses aren't what they had in mind. Rarity overcomes the disparaging reception and resolves to redo the dresses, wanting her friends to think they're absolutely perfect. After the ponies leave, Rarity wonders aloud, \"What have I gotten myself into?\"\n Fluttershy enters the boutique and Rarity shows her her new new gown. The scene cross-fades to Fluttershy in front of a mirror wearing the dress, and she tries to placate Rarity by saying she loves it, but Rarity doesn't buy it and pressures Fluttershy into telling her what she really thinks. Fluttershy goes off into a stream of intricate complaints about the sewing and the fabric, which leaves Rarity with her jaw dropped.\nThe scene cross-fades into a reprise of Art of the Dress, where each pony gives their input about the dress Rarity sews them and Rarity gets increasingly frustrated and exhausted. Twilight requests technically accurate constellations; Pinkie Pie requests lollipops, balloons, candy, and streamers; Fluttershy requests French haute couture; Applejack requests galoshes; and Rainbow Dash gives the vague request \"it needs to be about 20% cooler.\" At the song's conclusion, having finished all but her own, Rarity tells Opal that they are the ugliest dresses she's ever made.\nRarity presents the dresses to her friends, and they all happily proclaim they're exactly what they asked for. Spike arrives at the door and excitedly reports that he happened to mention Rarity's fashion show to Hoity Toity, which Twilight identifies as \"the bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot\", and that Hoity Toity is coming to Ponyville from Canterlot to see Rarity's work. Rarity shrinks in horror at the thought that Hoity Toity will see the dresses her friends helped design.\n At the fashion show, Rarity peeks from behind the curtain and spots Hoity Toity. She breathes heavily and tells herself to relax, certain that Hoity Toity will like the outfits. She shrieks in panic when the lights dim, before realizing it means the show is starting. The show soon starts, and the DJ, DJ Pon-3, puts on a record as Spike emcees. He announces the \"breathtaking designs of Ponyville's own Rarity!\" The ponies step onto the catwalk in their dresses and come to stand on a rotating platform. The crowd responds negatively, and Rarity's friends realize they overdid the dresses' designs. Hoity Toity declares the dresses \"amateurish,\" \"a piled-on mishmash of everything but a kitchen sink,\" \"the ugliest things [he's] ever seen,\" and other disparaging remarks. Spike, still excited for Rarity, asks her to come out and take a bow. She walks out with her eyes lowered, and the scene fades to the whispers of the crowd and the awkward smiles of Rarity's friends on stage.\nThe next scene begins with Rarity's friends at her door. Pinkie Pie knocks and asks Rarity if she's okay, mentioning that she hasn't come out in days. Rarity goes on a dramatic monologue:\n Twilight tries to coax her out, but she replies, \"Leave me alone! I want to be alone!\" The ponies try to figure out what to do, and Twilight spies Rarity's unfinished dress through the keyhole.\nThe scene fades to Rarity in her room in front of a mirror in a robe and slippers, contemplating leaving to live in exile. Rarity's contemplations are interrupted by Opal's mewling. She searches for the origin of the noise out the window, and sees Opal distressed and shivering, stuck on a tree branch. Rarity runs outside to rescue her and finds Rainbow Dash next to Opal, chiding her for stranding Opal on the tree. Dash points her attention to the dress that Rarity's friends finished for her, \"thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing\", according to Applejack. When asked for her opinion on the dress, Rarity says she doesn't like it\u2014she loves it. The ponies apologize for rejecting Rarity's original designs. Rarity forgives them but continues to wail about her ruined career. Fortunately, Hoity Toity agrees to attend a revised fashion show at Rarity's boutique.\n Hoity Toity declares \"take two\", Spike closes the curtains, and Rarity puts up a magic light show. Stylized animated backdrops accompany each dress presentation, with the dresses restored to how Rarity originally made them, and Hoity Toity expresses his amazement at the designs, calling them \"simply magnificent,\" \"brilliant,\" \"spectacular,\" and \"absolutely amazing.\" Rarity thanks him, and the scene cross-fades to Twilight dictating her friendship report to Spike. In Twilight's report, she says \"you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.\"\nHoity Toity walks over to Rarity and congratulates her for her impressive fashion debut and requests a dozen of each dress \"by next Tuesday.\" Rarity laughs nervously with a tic in her eye, and the scene cuts to black.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Twilight Sparkle practicing magic spells on Spike. Spike notices Pinkie Pie sneaking from cover to cover, wearing an umbrella hat and looking up at the sky.\nTwilight dismisses it as Pinkie Pie being herself, but then approaches her and asks what she's up to. Pinkie explains that her tail is twitching, which means her \"Pinkie Sense\" is telling her that \"stuff's gonna start falling!\" Twilight dismisses this but a frog falls on her face mid-sentence.\nFluttershy is flying above Pinkie and Twilight carrying a basket, a bag, and a cart, all loaded with goofy-looking frogs. She apologizes to Twilight and explains that she's moving the frogs from the pond to Froggy Bottom Bog, and then carries on her way.\nWhen Pinkie Pie tells Twilight she has something on her face (a frog), Twilight sarcastically asks if Pinkie's Pinkie Sense told her that. Twilight and Spike go on their way and talk about Pinkie's prediction, which Twilight dismisses as a coincidence. Pinkie catches up to them and warns them that her tail is twitching and something else is going to fall. Twilight dismisses this and again gets cut mid-sentence, this time falling into a ditch. Spike asks Pinkie if it's safe to go help Twilight, and she confirms since her tail stopped twitching.\nApplejack arrives and asks Twilight what she's doing in the ditch, and Spike replies that Pinkie predicted it. Twilight again dismisses the events as a coincidence. When Applejack hears Twilight mention \"twitchy tail\" she goes for cover, but Spike tells her it's safe since the prediction already came true. Applejack explains to Twilight that \"those of us who have been in Ponyville a while, have learned over time that, if Pinkie's-a-twichin', you better listen.\" Pinkie Pie rushes back and warns them that her ears are flopping and that she'll start a bath for Twilight. Twilight, again, dismisses the prediction, but gets caked in mud from a hay cart passing through a puddle behind her.\n The scene fades to Pinkie's bathroom in her apartment above Sugarcube Corner. She explains to Twilight, who's having a bath, that her Pinkie Sense involves \"different, little, niggly feelings [meaning] different things. [...] When my back is itchy, it means it's my lucky day. And, when my knee gets pinchy, that means something scary's about to happen [...] my shoulder's achy, that means there's an alligator in the tub!\" Twilight jumps out of the tub in fright and asks Pinkie why her knee didn't get pinchy. Pinkie explains that it's not scary because it's her pet alligator named Gummy who's got no teeth, while Gummy gums at her mane and tail.\nThe scene fades to Twilight and Pinkie walking away from Sugarcube Corner. Twilight says she still doesn't believe this \"mumbo-jumbo.\" Pinkie Pie asks \"What's not to believe? You do magic, what's the difference?\" Twilight's jaw drops, and she exclaims that the difference is huge. She literally climbs onto a soapbox and explains that magic only happens when you decide it to happen, and that Pinkie's sense makes no sense at all.\nThe two reach Golden Oak Library, and Pinkie Pie tells Twilight that different combinations of her reactions also predict the future, for example \"ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter.\" means the sky will be graced with a beautiful rainbow. Pinkie then experiences \"ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch,\" and Twilight gets squashed by Spike slamming the library door open. Spike backs up out of the library with an armload of books, accompanied by a sound effect of a truck backing up. Twilight, still recuperating, tells Pinkie that she said the combo meant \"beautiful rainbow,\" and Pinkie corrects her about the order of the twitches, which in this case meant \"look out for opening doors.\" Pinkie tells Twilight she doesn't believe because she doesn't understand. Twilight hums and rubs her chin with a thoughtful expression on her face.\n The scene cross-fades to the library basement where Pinkie Pie is hooked up to some sort of measuring instrument, a helmet with blinking lights strapped on her head, and her forelegs secured by metallic clasps. Twilight says that when she'll get another twitch, they'll have \"all kinds of scientific information.\" They wait for a twitch, but Pinkie says they just come and go, which Twilight says makes no sense. Pinkie affirms that \"sometimes you just have to believe in things,\" but Twilight protests and asserts she will not believe in anything she cannot explain. Twilight angrily gives up, and Pinkie slips out of her helmet and restraints. On their way out of the basement Pinkie gets an ear flop, eye flutter, and knee-twitch, then Twilight again gets smashed behind a door that Spike opens. Still stuck to the back of the door, she asks Spike if he and Pinkie planned this prediction. She asserts that \"this can't be happening. This makes no sense\" and that she has to figure it out.\n In a brief scene, Fluttershy reaches Froggy Bottom Bog with the frogs. The scene wipes to Pinkie Pie skipping about, with Twilight spying on her using a bush as concealment. Twilight wears a pith helmet and uses binoculars to observe Pinkie's actions. Spike walks up to Twilight and accidentally startles her, and she explains to him that she's observing Pinkie, \"scientific name: Pinkius Pieicus, in its natural habitat,\" and expresses her mistrust in Pinkie's Pinkie Sense.\nAt the school playground, she sees her scratching her nose before rushing to find a place to hide \"like something's about to fall from the sky.\" Twilight says this makes no sense because a twitchy tail indicates something would fall. Before she finishes dictating her conclusion to Spike, a swarm of bees appears and attacks her. Next, outside Applejack's barn, she sees another ear-flop eye-flutter knee-twitch combo. Spike identifies it as the combo for opening doors, and Twilight scoffs her belief in the prediction, and again suffers mid-sentence when she falls into a cellar door that had just opened.\nThe scene fades to Twilight in leg casts sitting in a wheelchair, still observing Pinkie Pie with her binoculars. She reports \"twitchy tail\" to Spike, who panics and runs away. Twilight again dismisses the prediction and tells Spike he's overreacting, but before she can finish her sentence a series of classic cartoon props drop on her head: a flower pot, an anvil, a cart of hay and finally a piano. The frame moves up to reveal that the items were dropped by Derpy and Sunshower Raindrops, who are hovering next to a movers' truck.\nTwilight later confronts Pinkie Pie and finds she was aware of her presence the whole time. Suddenly, Pinkie's entire body begins shaking. Spike asks what this means, but Pinkie answers that she doesn't know and she's never gotten it before, but that whatever it is, it's a \"doozy,\" something completely unexpected, and that it's going to happen at Froggy Bottom Bog. Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Spike rush to the bog to make sure Fluttershy, who was headed there earlier, is okay. Twilight dismisses the prediction yet again, but tags along anyway because she wants to be there to see the look on Pinkie's face when they find out nothing's wrong. The scene wipes to Fluttershy at Froggy Bottom Bog with ominous music and an unidentified creature moving in the waters behind Fluttershy while she sets the frogs loose.\n Pinkie keeps getting her twitches and Twilight makes sarcastic remarks towards her. Spike thinks up of bad things that could happen to Fluttershy, but Twilight assures him that she's fine. They reach the bog and soon find Fluttershy safe and sound. Twilight gloats about how right she was that there was no \"doozy\" and goes on about how there's no point in believing anything you can't see for yourself. Without her noticing, a huge creature creeps around the ponies, and Spike calls Twilight's attention to it. She looks behind her at a gigantic four-headed hydra which growls and roars.\nThe ponies and Spike run and the hydra pursues them. Twice Twilight goes back, to pull Pinkie Pie along and to rescue Spike from sinking in the bog. They run up a hill but get trapped at the edge of a cliff, with stepping-stone pillars leading to the other side. Fluttershy is the first pony to cross the chasm. Despite being a Pegasus she doesn't fly, however she recites to herself \"a hop, skip, and a jump\" from the song Pinkie Pie taught her in Dragonshy. Pinkie Pie has a Pinkie Sense episode and shakes herself over the edge of the cliff, though she hangs in mid-air and gets pulled back by Applejack, who carries her across by the tail.\nTwilight decides to charge at the hydra head-on, or in this case right under it. Before she has a chance to cross herself, the hydra lunges at her but misses, driving one of its heads into the edge of the cliff and knocking over one of the stepping-stone pillars, which in turn knocks the next one and the next, so only two are left. Pinkie Pie tries to convince Twilight to \"take a leap of faith.\" The hydra lunges again and breaks off the ground Twilight was standing on. Twilight jumps but misses the pillar, and lands on a bog bubble that bounces her across the chasm and over to her friends.\n Just as Twilight congratulates Pinkie for predicting the doozy, Pinkie has another spell of shudders, and she tells Twilight that the hydra wasn't the doozy. When Twilight hears the hydra wasn't the doozy, Twilight literally bursts into flames in anger. She says she gives up, and that she's willing to believe the Pinkie Sense is true even though she doesn't understand it. Pinkie goes through some strange twitches which suddenly stop, and she tells Twilight that that was the doozy, Twilight's willingness to believe.\n Wearing an umbrella hat with Pinkie Pie, Twilight gives Spike a friendship report for Princess Celestia. As the episode ends, Pinkie's tail twitches once more, and Spike takes Twilight's report out to the balcony. Before he can send it, though, Princess Celestia falls out of the sky and takes the scroll from him with a smile then lifts off again.\n"}, {"summary": "Rainbow Dash paces around Fluttershy in a review of their preparation for the Best Young Flyer competition. Satisfied that Fluttershy has an understanding of the elements of a good cheer, Rainbow Dash wants her to go over the cheer itself. Much to Dash's frustration, Fluttershy's first three attempts are feeble. On the fourth attempt, which is just as weak, Rainbow collapses backward onto the grass, to which Fluttershy says, \"Too loud?\"\n Fluttershy watches Rainbow Dash practice a routine for the Best Young Flyer competition. Rainbow Dash unsuccessfully attempts to perform a sonic rainboom and ends up crashing into the Golden Oak Library. She knocks over books that her friends just finished sorting. Rainbow Dash tells her friends about the competition and says that the competition's grand prize is a day with her idols, The Wonderbolts. Before she leaves, she tells Fluttershy to work on her cheering. Rarity urges Twilight Sparkle to find a spell that will allow the non-Pegasi friends to access Cloudsdale so they can support Rainbow Dash. Rarity volunteers to be the test subject of a spell that gives her a pair of beautiful butterfly wings.\n In Cloudsdale, Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash run into three bullies who say that Rainbow Dash can't pull off the sonic rainboom. She doubts her own flying skills after the bullies leave. The rest of the Mane Six arrive and explain that Twilight cast a spell that enables them to walk on clouds like Pegasi. The friends tour the weather factory, where Pegasi manufacture snowflakes, rainbows, and clouds. The workers stop to admire Rarity\u2019s wings, much to Rainbow Dash's chagrin; one worker even suggests that she enter the Best Young Flyer competition. Rarity decides to participate in the competition, much to Rainbow's shock. At the Cloudeseum stadium, the competition begins. Princess Celestia and three Wonderbolts (Spitfire, Soarin, and Misty Fly) are the judges. The competitors have number tags on their flanks:\nRainbow Dash switches her tag with other competitors to delay her turn. When everyone except Rainbow Dash and Rarity has gone, the announcer tells them that they will have to perform together due to time constraints.\n Rainbow Dash makes several mistakes in the first two phases of her routine. She starts phase three: the sonic rainboom. Meanwhile, Rarity, dressed in an extravagant costume, flies higher to let the sunlight illuminate her wings. However, the wings are too delicate for the sun's rays and they quickly burn to ashes, sending her plummeting towards the ground. The Wonderbolts immediately dive to rescue her, but Rarity\u2019s flailing limbs end up knocking them out cold. Seeing the potentially deadly situation they're in, Rainbow Dash hurtles down to save them. She pulls off the sonic rainboom, exciting Fluttershy into a loud cheer and astonishing the rest of their friends into speechlessness, and catches them just before they hit the ground. Rarity apologizes to her friends for getting carried away with her wings, and they forgive her. Princess Celestia presents the grand prize for Best Young Flyer to Rainbow Dash. Rarity gives this episode\u2019s friendship report and says that she learned to be there for her friends while keeping her hooves on the ground, literally and figuratively. The three bullies congratulate and apologize to Rainbow Dash, who forgives them. Dumb-Bell asks her if she wants to hang out with them and hopes that she will teach them how to do the sonic rainboom, but Rainbow Dash replies that she's already got plans to hang out with the Wonderbolts.\n"}, {"summary": "The episode begins with Rarity in her shop trying to complete an order of twenty robes for Trottingham by the following day. Her sister\u00a0Sweetie Belle\u00a0tries to help in an attempt to get her cutie mark but just ends up making a mess. Fluttershy soon arrives to drop off Rarity's cat\u00a0Opalescence\u00a0from her grooming appointment. Rarity is surprised at how well behaved her cat is, seeing as she couldn't get Opal to behave without getting scratched. She asks Fluttershy if she used \"the Stare\" on Opalescence, but Fluttershy says it's just due to her being good with animals.\n Moments later, Scootaloo and Apple Bloom arrive for their sleepover at Rarity's house. Together with Sweetie Belle, the Cutie Mark Crusaders\u00a0plan on finding their hidden talents in order to get their cutie marks. Sweetie Belle even made capes with golden underlining for the three to represent the group. Unfortunately, the gold she used was part of a silk cloth Rarity needed to finish her order. Realizing that it's going to take much longer than before, Rarity is forced to cancel her sister's sleepover. Seeing the young fillies disappointed, Fluttershy offers to take care of them. Rarity warns her that her little sister and her friends can be quite a handful, but Fluttershy insists.\nIn town, Fluttershy runs into Twilight Sparkle, who's off to visit Zecora in the Everfree Forest for some tea. Learning that Fluttershy is going to babysit the three fillies, Twilight wonders if she can handle it.\nIn Fluttershy's cottage, she asks the Crusaders what they'd like to do first. The fillies suggest going adventuring in the Everfree Forest, but Fluttershy forbids this due to the forest's dangers. The Crusaders try to be \"creature catchers,\" but their roughhousing results in breaking a nearby table. They then try their hoof at carpentry to fix the table, but that doesn't work out so well either. Fluttershy tries to keep them quiet by playing a game of \"Shhh!,\" a game of who can be quiet the longest, but the Crusaders end it immediately by losing on purpose. Before the three's hyperactivity gets out of hand again, Fluttershy sees them to bed, promising they can do more \"crusading\" in the morning.\n The three fillies claim they aren't sleepy yet, so Fluttershy sings them a lullaby. Sweetie Belle recognizes the song, and Fluttershy suggests she sing along, prompting Apple\u00a0Bloom and Scootaloo to cover their ears.\u00a0Her version of the lullaby, however, is loud enough to wake up the chickens in a nearby chicken coop. The Cutie Mark Crusaders run out of the house to help rustle the flock back to the coop. In the end, Fluttershy is able to get the chickens back in the coop by giving them an intimidating look.\nFluttershy tucks the Crusaders into bed again, but they're still wide awake. They still want to find their talents, and decide to sneak out of the cottage when they notice that one of the chickens has escaped to the Everfree Forest.\nFluttershy is relieved that it's quiet but notices that it's too quiet. She goes to check on the fillies and discovers that they're gone. Looking into the henhouse, she also notices that one of the chickens named Elizabeak is gone too. Seeing hoofprints leading into the Everfree Forest, Fluttershy hesitantly ventures into the forest to find them. While the Crusaders argue amongst themselves, Fluttershy finds Twilight, only to discover that she's been turned to stone. Realizing what this means, she rushes to find the fillies.\n Fluttershy finds the Cutie Mark Crusaders looking for the missing Elizabeak. She tells them that a cockatrice, a creature with the head of a chicken and a body of a snake, is on the loose, and warns them not to look one in the eyes. However, they laugh at the silly description before seeing the chicken pass them by. They notice a second chicken hiding in the bushes, one with a long reptilian body: the cockatrice. Its stare causes Elizabeak to turn to stone. The Crusaders panic at the sight of this, and Fluttershy tells them to stand behind her. When she sees how scared the fillies are, Fluttershy confronts the cockatrice face-to-face. She counters the cockatrice's gaze with her own intimidating stare, ordering it to change Elizabeak and Twilight back to normal. As the cockatrice runs away, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, impressed by their babysitter's ability, dub her the \"Stare Master.\" With Twilight and Elizabeak free from the creature's spell, they all return home.\nBack at the cottage the next morning, Fluttershy explains to Twilight the events that happened, inspiring her to write another report to Princess Celestia. Fluttershy learns one shouldn't do a task that is more than can be handled.\nRarity then returns, surprised at how well her sister and her friends behave. She tries to get the Crusaders to collect their things to no avail. Fluttershy, however, gets their attention easily, and the Crusaders run inside to get their\u00a0bags.\u00a0An impressed Rarity then\u00a0asks Fluttershy to help her with a new problem with her cat Opal, who is clinging tightly to her body.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Applejack leading the Cutie Mark Crusaders through Sweet Apple Acres, without telling them where they're going. They eventually reach an old clubhouse that she used as a filly. Unfortunately, the group is less than thrilled at this hand-me-down clubhouse\u00a0because it's in disrepair from years of neglect. Applejack tells them that they can fix it up to become their new base of operations, then immediately falls through a wall.\nLater, Scootaloo stands in front of Golden Oak Library and adds it to a hoof-drawn map of Ponyville. After a high-speed run on her scooter she returns to the clubhouse, which Apple Bloom has completely repaired. Meanwhile, Sweetie Belle is dusting and making up a theme song for the group.\nWith everything set up, they continue their quest to find their special talents. The adventure takes them everywhere on their map: they feed pigs at Sweet Apple Acres, make taffy at Sugarcube Corner, style hair at Rarity's boutique, use a modified form of Zener cards, climb rocks, and go scuba diving. Each attempt is a spectacular failure, after which they look eagerly at their flanks but do not receive their cutie marks. The last stop on their map is Twilight Sparkle's library. The musical score during the montage of their attempts is the same music that plays during Diamond Tiara's cute-cea\u00f1era in Call of the Cutie and both Gummy's and Pinkie Pie's birthday party in Party of One.\nTwilight Sparkle and the girls' teacher, Cheerilee, walk into the library and see the Crusaders among a huge pile of fallen books. Twilight asks what's going on, to which Apple Bloom replies, \"Well, we sure aren't gettin' our cutie marks for bein' librarians.\" Twilight tells them that they're trying to get their cutie marks the wrong way, and suggests they do things in areas they already like. Cheerilee shows them a flier for a talent show that will be taking place the next day. With so many possibilities to find their talents, the fillies start to plan their show, each making bizarre or dangerous suggestions. Twilight again urges them to do something they're already good at. The girls say they can do that, then go around town collecting and borrowing random items.\nInside the clubhouse, the Crusaders come up with a plan for the show: a spectacular musical number. Apple Bloom suggests Sweetie Belle as the singer, but Sweetie Belle is afraid to sing in front of a crowd and says she would rather be like her sister, Rarity, and design the scenery. Despite Scootaloo's agility, she decides to sing instead of doing the choreography, thus leaving the job to Apple Bloom, though the closest thing she knows is Kung Fu. They all fail miserably while practicing but help each other out in the process.\nWhile they're finishing their preparations, Applejack comes to check on them. She sees their act is terrible and hesitates when they ask her opinion. Thinking she's impressed, they feel ready to wow the crowd.\n The show begins with Snips and Snails trying to pull off a magic trick, and then Sunny Daze and Peachy Pie doing a poem on roller skates. Backstage, the Cutie Mark Crusaders talk with Twilight, who initially tells them they'll do great but looks worried when she learns that they aren't sticking to their own talents. The performance starts off smoothly, but soon Scootaloo begins singing off-key, Apple Bloom starts accidentally dancing into scenery, and Sweetie Belle struggles to maintain the backdrops and effects. In the end, the entire act literally falls on top of them, and the audience laughs. They slink backstage, wondering if they were really \"that bad.\" Cheerilee meets them and tells them to go back onstage for the awards, but they're too embarrassed. She tells them to be good sports, so they return with her while trying to hide behind the other performers.\nTo their surprise, they win the award for best comedy act, which immediately perks them up until they find out they still haven't gotten their cutie marks. After the show, Twilight congratulates them for a job well done and asks them if they learned anything, saying she could make a special friendship report. As she asks them questions, they seem to understand their mistakes, eventually reaching the conclusion that their true talent is comedy instead. Applejack, Rarity and Rainbow Dash come backstage, and the Cutie Mark Crusaders run off to talk with them. After the Crusaders run off, Twilight chuckles and expresses hope that the fillies will one day figure out their talents.\n"}, {"summary": " Inside the Carousel Boutique, as Rarity is putting the last gem onto a garment, she hears a customer walk into her shop. She casually greets the customer, only to find out in shock that it's \"Pony of Pop\" sensation\u00a0Sapphire Shores. Sapphire explains that she had heard of Rarity's fashion designs from a local magazine and came to browse the shop for designs for an upcoming tour. Rarity happily shows Sapphire her latest finished project: a garment completely covered in gems. Sapphire takes an immediate liking to the bejeweled garment, saying that she will buy it and five more like it, each one featuring a different jewel. Having used her entire gem supply for just the one outfit, Rarity faints.\n With assistance from Spike, Rarity goes to find a new load of gems outside Ponyville. When they first uncover some, Spike can barely contain his hunger, but Rarity reminds him that they need to collect the gems for Sapphire Shores' outfits. Spike manages to curb his appetite, and in the end Rarity rewards him with a blue gem. Rather than eat it right away, he decides to keep it as a gift from his crush.\n Hiding in the bushes is a trio of canines who call themselves the Diamond Dogs. They are in awe of the large haul of jewels being carted along by the baby dragon, mistaking him as a gem tracker. They then hear Rarity's voice and discover that she is the one finding the gems. Ambushed by the mutts, Rarity panics, but Spike intercepts them so Rarity can escape. However, they shake him off and succeed in abducting Rarity before escaping into their hole in the ground. After explaining the situation to Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Applejack,\u00a0Spike brings them to the spot of the incident only to see the entire site laden with holes. They encounter the dogs but are outmaneuvered to exhaustion when the dogs refill the holes and then pop out of them to trip the ponies up.\nAs the ponies worry about Rarity and how frightened she must be,\u00a0Spike\u00a0uses his blue gem as bait to catch one of the dogs with a fishing rod. The scene dissolves into a fantasy sequence where Spike imagines himself as a debonair knight coming to Rarity's rescue. His fishing line is snagged, and he and the ponies are dragged through a large underground tunnel that gives way to a whole network of tunnels. They theorize that the dogs had taken Rarity down the tunnel with the most gems, but there is no way to find her until Spike reminds Twilight that Rarity showed her how to track gems herself. Using the spell, Twilight locates the tunnel with the most gems.\n Within the central area of the Diamond Dogs' den, the dogs demand Rarity find gems for them. She graciously finds them some gems and then asks to be let go, but the dogs order her to dig for the gems. She does so but very slowly and inefficiently. Frustrated at this pathetically slow pace, the leader calls on his comrades to do the digging. Rarity proceeds to make things exceedingly difficult for the dogs, complaining about her situation and even getting them to do all the work. But the dogs soon decide to endure Rarity's constant whining as long as she does as she's told. However, after one of the dogs calls her a mule, Rarity breaks down in tears.\nIn a nearby tunnel, Spike and the ponies hear Rarity's cries and rush to help her. A group of guard dogs sees them as new \"workhorses\" and ambushes them. Following Applejack's lead, the ponies buck the dogs off rodeo-style, and the guard dogs retreat. After they get rid of the guards, Spike hops on Twilight, brandishing a lance-like stalactite, and the six friends gallop to Rarity's rescue. They find Rarity after she's already cowed the Diamond Dogs into submission. The dogs, tired of Rarity's whining, offer to give away all of the gems they found, providing the ponies take Rarity with them.\nOn their way home, Rarity reveals that annoying her captors was all a ruse to keep them under control. Twilight sees this as a valuable lesson to write Princess Celestia about:\u00a0just because someone is ladylike doesn't mean they're helpless.\n"}, {"summary": "Rarity and Fluttershy meet at the spa for their weekly get-together.

Spike reveals his crush on Rarity to Pinkie and Twilight. Pinkie is shocked, but Twilight finds the crush obvious. Before Twilight can say this, Pinkie warns her that \"losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend forever!\"\n Photo Finish arrives to photograph Fluttershy. Fluttershy does poses that Rarity suggests, but Photo Finish dislikes them. Fluttershy's timid reactions to her outbursts intrigue Photo Finish. The session ends quickly, and Fluttershy and Rarity believe it was not successful. However, Photo Finish informs them that there will be another photo shoot at the park and leaves. Rarity is delighted by this news.\nOn the day of the shoot, Photo Finish rejects a set of clothes that Rarity picks for Fluttershy. When Rarity offers to find a new dress, Photo Finish refers to Fluttershy as the star she wants to help \"shine\" over Equestria. Fluttershy tries to back out, but Rarity insists that she take this opportunity for her sake.\nBack at the Boutique, Rarity asks her friends to leave her alone. Spike wants to be left alone with her, but Twilight drags him out.\n Photo Finish organizes a fashion show, and other ponies there take notice of Fluttershy. Fluttershy slowly becomes famous, getting featured in fashion magazines, advertisements, and endorsement deals. Rarity becomes jealous of the attention that Fluttershy is getting.

Rarity congratulates Fluttershy on her fame. They agree to meet for another spa day, and Photo Finish arrives to bring Fluttershy to another shoot. Sweetie Drops and Berryshine\u00a0enter the shop hoping to see Fluttershy, and do not care about Rarity's dresses.\u00a0\nIn an interview, Photo Finish comments on how happy she is to work with Fluttershy. Fluttershy unsuccessfully attempts to tell Photo Finish about her plans to go to the spa.\n At the spa, Rarity realizes that Fluttershy is not coming. She talks to Twilight about her jealousy and hope that Fluttershy's rising star would \"burn out.\" Before she leaves, Rarity makes Twilight promise not to tell Fluttershy about her confession.\nFluttershy arrives a minute later and is frustrated about being unable to meet Rarity. She tells Twilight that she dislikes being a model but continues because of Rarity's support. Twilight is about to tell her Rarity's secret when Pinkie appears and reminds Twilight of the price of breaking secrets.\nTwilight suggests that Fluttershy act the exact opposite of what Photo Finish wants: clumsy and unattractive. Twilight will use her magic to sabotage the next fashion show and cause Fluttershy to be fired. She discusses her plan with Pinkie and swears her to secrecy.\n During the next fashion show, Twilight uses her magic to manipulate Fluttershy into barking, baying, tripping, falling, and picking her nose. Photo Finish is dismayed with the performance. The audience begins to boo and jeer. However, Rarity arrives and, not knowing Twilight's plan, praises Fluttershy's novel approach to catwalking. Rarity's flashy outfit wins over the audience members, who judge it representative of good fashion. As a result, the audience applauds Fluttershy as well, making her more popular than before.\n After the show, Fluttershy, Rarity, and Twilight are backstage. Fluttershy attempts to be cheerful about her rising stardom, while Twilight struggles to keep their secrets. Rarity finally confesses her jealousy and says that she couldn't stand to see Fluttershy fall from stardom. Fluttershy tells her that she only continued modeling to avoid disappointing Rarity.\nPhoto Finish enters and tells Fluttershy that her performance has created a demand for more photo shoots. However, Fluttershy resigns as Photo Finish's model. She and Rarity promise not to hide their feelings from each other anymore, and they exit the room, leaving Photo Finish confused. In the empty room, Twilight blurts out Spike's crush on Rarity. Pinkie appears inside a mirror and expresses her disappointment at Twilight\u2019s failure.\nRarity, Fluttershy, and Twilight enjoy a stay at the spa. Twilight dictates her friendship report to Spike about keeping secrets and sharing feelings with friends. Spike is still upset that Twilight revealed his secret, but forgives her when she apologizes. When asked to send the report, Spike states that he is \"busy at the moment,\" fanning Rarity, to Twilight's amusement.\n"}, {"summary": "The episode begins with Twilight Sparkle and her friends on a train to the recently-built western town of Appleloosa, where Applejack plans to replant one of her trees - named Bloomberg - in her relatives' orchard. Everyone is looking forward to Appleloosa, but during the journey, Spike and Rarity show varying amounts of discomfort: Rarity doesn't like the fact that Applejack's tree was placed in a private cart in the rear, forcing her to bunk with her friends, and Spike is tired from cooking snacks with his fire breath.\nWhen Rainbow Dash complains that not all of her popcorn kernels were popped, Spike burns her popcorn black and goes to bed. Rainbow Dash asks Pinkie Pie if they're going to carry the tree all the way to the apple orchard. Pinkie Pie, wondering if she refers to Bloomberg, is met with a sarcastic response from Rainbow Dash saying they would actually be carrying Fluttershy. Failing to get the joke, Pinkie tells Rainbow Dash that Fluttershy is not a tree. This leads to a rather confusing conversation with Twilight, but in the end, Fluttershy is awake as well, saying that she would like to be a tree. Spike, frustrated with his inability to fall asleep, makes his way to the private cart to bunk with Bloomberg. Fluttershy jokingly calls Spike \"Huffy the magic dragon,\" and the four friends laugh. Rarity, frustrated herself, demands they be quiet, and all of them go to sleep.\nThe next morning, the ponies are awoken by a herd of stampeding buffalo charging next to the train. The buffalo start ramming into the side of the train in an ambush attack. Due to lack of sleep the previous night, Spike sleeps through the attack. A younger, leaner buffalo leaps onto the train and, after outmaneuvering Rainbow Dash, disconnects the caboose from the other train cars. The buffalo then push the disconnected caboose down the line in the opposite direction, with Bloomberg and Spike still inside.\nUpon arriving at Appleloosa, Applejack rushes out to tell her cousin Braeburn, who had been waiting excitedly at the station for their arrival, that they have a problem. Unfortunately, Braeburn insists on giving his cousin and her friends a tour around the new town. Finally, after going as far as showing the group the new apple orchard, Applejack finally gets Braeburn's attention. She tells him what had happened to the train before their arrival, and Braeburn sadly says that he's aware of the whole situation, stating that the buffalo are demanding for them to remove the trees, but they argue that they can't, otherwise the town wouldn't be able to survive in the desert.\n Coincidentally, Pinkie has the same idea as Rainbow Dash to find and rescue Spike by getting to the buffalo herd, but the herd manages to get to them first. Just before a fight breaks out, Spike arrives and breaks it up, using his new respect that he has somehow earned from the buffalo.\nPinkie and Rainbow Dash are brought to the buffalo tribe's camp, where Dash meets the young female buffalo Little Strongheart again, and are told that because Appleloosan townsponies have planted the orchard, they can no longer travel along their traditional stampeding grounds. She explains that the theft of Bloomberg was to send a message. Chief Thunderhooves then arrives, confirms Little Strongheart's explanation, and says that the land the Appleloosans now inhabit was stampeded upon by many generations of buffalo. Rainbow Dash feels sympathetic toward the herd of buffalo, and makes sure to talk to the townsponies about it.\nPinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash return to Appleloosa with Little Strongheart just as Twilight, the rest of her friends, and Braeburn are about to set out in search of them. Rainbow Dash urges Little Strongheart to tell them why the Appleloosans should move the trees, while Applejack urges Braeburn to tell Little Strongheart why the trees should stay. Both Braeburn and Little Strongheart are made very uncomfortable by the situation and being forced to speak, and end up not saying anything to each other. Instead, Applejack and Rainbow Dash begin arguing about it. Before long, Twilight intervenes and says that both sides have good reasons to keep the land.\n Pinkie Pie tries to send out a message about sharing by putting on a quick song-and-dance number, as both Appleloosans and buffalo watch. Pinkie tries to encourage them to share by singing about the similarities between the ponies and buffalo.\nUnfortunately, Thunderhooves and the town's sheriff Silverstar are not impressed. The only thing they could agree on is that Pinkie's performance was the worst they had ever seen. After declaring a time for action, the buffalo chief gives a clear ultimatum: the townsfolk must uproot all of the trees by high noon the next day, or the herd will be forced to destroy them, along with Appleloosa in the process. Silverstar, in response, simply states that the town will be waiting for them.\n Twilight and the others try to talk both the Appleloosans and the buffalo out of the fight, but no one is listening. High noon the next day finally arrives, and the buffalo appear on a ridge overlooking the town. Strongheart softly gestures to the chief to back down, and it almost works, until Pinkie Pie appears, singing a reprise of her number from the day before in a last-ditch, last-minute, and horrendously ill-timed effort to stop the fight before it even begins. Thunderhooves, now enraged, signals the buffalo to go on the attack, using nothing more or less than their own brute strength. The townsponies fight back against the buffalo with an ample supply of apple pies, which are surprisingly effective at confusing and stopping the stampeding buffalo. Both groups manage to take out some of their opposition, also damaging the town in the process. The scene shifts to Silverstar making a final stand next to his saloon, and once he runs out of apple pies to throw, he takes off his hat in quiet submission, as Thunderhooves makes a mad charge at him. However, a stray apple pie hits Thunderhooves square in the face, disabling him. Lying on the ground momentarily, Thunderhooves licks the apple pie off of his face, and enthralled by its delicious taste, says they could come to an agreement.\n The Appleloosan ponies are allowed to keep the land, and in return, the Appleloosans would share its fruit (or more specifically, its apple pies) with the buffalo herd during their stampeding. The townsponies, meanwhile, create a road through the orchard so the herd can continue their stampeding tradition. Both parties find this to be agreeable and the dispute has come to an end. In addition, Applejack is finally able to plant Bloomberg.\nTwilight learns that with compromise and understanding, to share and to care, sometimes the worst of enemies can become the best of friends.\n"}, {"summary": "Fluttershy has just finished her routine caretaking when Angel arrives, attempting to remind her of something by showing her a watch. After a few guesses, Fluttershy realizes that she's late for brunch with her friends and Princess Celestia. Fluttershy stresses over how she looks and what to wear, and looks through a rack of dresses which carries the Grand Galloping Gala dresses from Suited for Success. When Fluttershy is still hesitant after leaving the house, Angel locks her out to prevent her from wasting additional time.\n The brunch takes place in Sugarcube Corner's snack shop where Spike is working in the kitchen, wearing a chef's hat, using his fire breath to bake pies. Twilight Sparkle is already nervous about the Princess' arrival and whether she'll approve of her friends, despite the fact that she had already met \u2013 but not spoken to \u2013 them on several occasions. Twilight's friends' mannerisms during the brunch do nothing to quell her anxiety. Mr. and Mrs. Cake make sure the princess has plenty of tea to drink; the Princess thanks them for each refill, but grows awkward due to the constant hospitality. She decides to have a little fun with them by pretending to sip from her cup, making them overfill it.\nWhile Celestia speaks to Fluttershy about what Twilight told her from her letters, she's distracted by her pet bird Philomena, whose condition appears to be less than well; however, before Celestia can stay long, one of the Princess' royal guards informs her about her engagement with the Mayor, and she is forced to leave. Everyone is relieved. However, Celestia leaves her pet in the shop and Fluttershy, believing it to be sick, decides to take it into her house for treatment.\n Oddly enough, Philomena appears to be a very difficult patient to Fluttershy. She tries everything she can think of, including taking her temperature, attempting to make her ingest a medicine tablet, making tomato soup, and even having her and a former patient of hers, Hummingway, sing together to her.\nHer condition does not improve, and she ends up coughing mouse food in Fluttershy's face. At this point, she's convinced Philomena has a \"tickle\" in her throat, and sets up a humidifier to clear it. It is not, however, effective as evidenced by another cough despite her therapy. Fluttershy refuses to give up, however, and tries some more remedies (aroma therapy, warm bath, and ointment); none of them work.\nBy this time, Philomena appears to be even sicker. As a last resort, Fluttershy decides to attach the feathers that had fallen off with surgical tape; predictably, it fails to work. Just as she is about to give up, there's a knock at the door from Twilight Sparkle. She's here to thank Fluttershy for making a good impression, but is shocked after she sees Philomena in the house. While she sympathizes with Fluttershy's good intentions, she insists that she still had taken the bird without Celestia's permission, and Twilight believes that the consequences will be dire. Against her better judgment, Fluttershy and Twilight agree, and put Philomena in a basket so she can be returned to her cage.\n Just as they reach the exit of the house, Celestia's guards arrive to relay the news about the missing bird. She and Fluttershy attempt to lie their way out of the situation, and wish the guards luck on their search. Despite the fact that the lie includes fake coughing and claims of day air being drier than night air, it works well enough for them to leave quickly. It's clear that they cannot simply return Philomena at this point (Twilight believes that Fluttershy could be banished, put in a dungeon or banished and then put in a dungeon in the place that she is banished), so they decide not to risk it.\nFluttershy still hopes that she can cure Philomena. However, she lacks the assertiveness to cure her, so Twilight offers to help by giving \"tough love,\" using much more abrasive techniques than Fluttershy did. Just as Twilight is about to force-feed some soup to Philomena, she escapes through the door, though the door-frame on Philomena's cage is actually no larger or smaller than the other viewing holes on the cage.\n The ponies pursue the bird in a chase scene around Ponyville, trying to catch her while avoiding the guards.\nTwilight Sparkle and Fluttershy find their other friends, but they're confused as to why they're scattered all over the place, lifting them up and down. They finally discover Philomena on top of the town's fountain statue; she has lost all her feathers and appears to be dying. She then falls off the statue rather dramatically. Fluttershy rushes over in an attempt to catch her, but can only watch in sheer horror as she spontaneously reduces herself to ash.\n Just as the animal-loving Pegasus begins to cry, Princess Celestia arrives to discover the commotion; Twilight, believing her mentor will go easier on her, tries to cover for her, but Fluttershy insists that she should come clean and tell the truth instead, even at the risk of punishment from Equestria's ruler. The princess tells the pile of ash to \"stop fooling around,\" to which it responds by materializing into a majestic red-and-orange bird. She explains that what appeared to be sickly molting was actually just another part of a phoenix's life cycle. Apparently, Philomena took advantage of this as an opportunity for mischief and is told to apologize.\nFluttershy receives no punishment, but Celestia reminds her that everything could have been avoided if she just asked to take care of Philomena. Fluttershy apologizes for the entire ordeal. Twilight realizes that this situation is a lesson about asking before taking matters into your own hooves, and asks if the Princess would like a report, but Celestia declines. Later, Rainbow Dash gets Philomena to tickle the royal guards on their noses with a feather as a prank, and when it is successful, she gives Rainbow Dash a high five, whilst Celestia, the royal guards, and the Mane Six laugh with them.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins when Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle try to zip-line in the forest. Since the tension of the rope is too low, they lose momentum and get bunched up in the middle, while the friction between their carabiners and the rope causes the rope to burn through. They tumble down and get covered in pine needles and sticky tree sap, but they don't get their cutie marks. While washing off the sap, they agree to spend the rest of the day investigating how other ponies got their cutie marks, a safer alternative to going on adventures. Scootaloo is intent on getting Rainbow Dash's story, because Dash is \"fast, tough, and not afraid of anything.\"\nApple Bloom and Sweetie Belle ride on a cart attached to Scootaloo's scooter to get back to Ponyville. Suddenly, three rabbits holding apples cross the path, and Scootaloo brings her scooter to a halt. It turns out that Applejack had been chasing the \"thievin' varmints.\" Apple Bloom asks her older sister how she got her cutie mark, to the disappointment of Scootaloo who reluctantly agrees to hear the story.\n Applejack says that when she was a filly, she left Sweet Apple Acres for the metropolitan city of Manehattan to live a glamorous life. Her Aunt and Uncle Orange take her in and are amused by her saying, \"y'all,\" promising to turn her into a proper \"Manehattanite\" in no time. The scene cuts to a formal dinner. A pony asks Applejack for her opinion of Manehattan life. Applejack smiles and says that it's \"simply divine,\" but she lets slip that roosters crow in the morning in her hometown. The high-class ponies have no idea what a rooster is. Dinner is served, postponing Applejack's embarrassment, but there are only a few disappointing morsels on the plate.\nAs she watches the sun rise the next morning, she says out loud how much she misses her family and the apple orchards. Just then, she hears a loud bang and sees a beautiful rainbow stretch across the sky towards home. She realizes that she truly belongs at home on the farm. Gladly returning to the farm and greeting her grandma and brother, her cutie mark springs into existence: a trio of red apples. After Applejack runs off to continue pursuing the rabbits, Scootaloo presses the group onwards.\nThe crusaders narrowly avoid colliding with Fluttershy, who is guiding ducklings across a road. She tells them that they should be more careful, and asks them why they are in such a hurry. When they tell her that they're on their way to get Rainbow Dash's cutie mark story, Fluttershy says that she owes her cutie mark to Dash.\n Fluttershy recalls that when she was little, she was very shy and the weakest flier in her summer flight camp. After failing at an attempt to fly through some cloud rings, two male Pegasi start making fun of her. Fluttershy calls it \"the most humiliating moment of [her] life.\" Suddenly, Rainbow Dash lands in between Fluttershy and the bullies, telling them to leave her alone. The bullies and Dash agree to a race to determine who's the \"big shot.\" Fluttershy, standing on another cloud, waves a checkered flag to start the race. As they take off, Fluttershy is knocked off her cloud and into free fall. Unable to fly, she keeps falling until a dense swarm of butterflies gently carries her to the ground. She had never been near the ground before and so had never seen butterflies before, but she finds them and the surrounding meadows beautiful. She starts singing to express her admiration of the little creatures and sights in this new world. At the end of her song, there is a loud bang in the sky, accompanied by an enormous expanding rainbow-colored ring. The bang frightens the animals, and they run for cover. Fluttershy kindly calms the quaking animals, discovering her innate ability to communicate with animals on a \"different level.\" This earns her the cutie mark of three pink butterflies.\nSince Fluttershy did not witness the rest of the race, Scootaloo wants to find Dash. Sweetie Belle suggests that maybe Rarity knows. Somehow, they end up being Rarity's assistants. Hearing of their ongoing pursuit of their cutie marks, she recalls the time she got hers.\n Rarity says that when she was a filly, she was put in charge of costumes during a school play. The day before the performance, her teacher calls them \"very nice,\" but they aren't good enough for Rarity; they need to be spectacular. In her workroom, Rarity tries every trick she knows, but the costumes won't work. She wonders if her dream of being a fashion designer is dissolving before her very eyes. Her horn begins to glow brightly and drags her to a desolate, rocky area, right into a large boulder. She is less than pleased at the possibility that a rock might have to do with her destiny and yells at her horn. She is interrupted by an explosive rainbow ring, exactly like the one that Fluttershy witnessed. The shock waves split the boulder, revealing a cavity filled with multicolored gems. On the night of the performance, the dancers wear dazzling gem-studded dresses. Rarity's inspiration, not to mention her new ability to track hidden gems, gives her a cutie mark of three blue diamonds.\nScootaloo pushes her friends out of the shop, tired of Rarity's \"namby-pamby\" story. She hopes to find Dash and hear a more exciting tale. They encounter Twilight, however, and they end up listening to hers.\n Even as a filly, Twilight has her knack for magic. After witnessing Princess Celestia raise the sun with magic at the Summer Sun Celebration, Twilight is inspired to extensively study magic. She is seen in her bedroom with a pile of books, performing magic for the first time when she is able to magically turn the pages of her book. Her parents enroll her into Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns. The entrance exam is to hatch a dragon's egg using magic. Under the scrutiny of the judges, she is too stressed to cast a successful spell. Just as she gives up and apologizes for wasting the testers' time, she hears an ear-shattering boom outside. Inexplicably, it triggers her magic and she directs her beam of magic towards the egg. The egg hatches, revealing baby Spike. However, she immediately loses control, causing her eyes to glow white. Magic and lightning fills the whole room, levitating judges, turning her parents into potted plants, and making Spike gigantic. Outside, Princess Celestia sees Spike's head bursting through the tower roof. She places her hoof on Twilight and Twilight withdraws her magic and profusely apologizes. Celestia says that she has never seen a filly with such raw ability. She offers to take Twilight as her personal prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to teach her how to control her magic. Twilight's parents eagerly encourage her to take the offer and Twilight is overjoyed. Celestia points out that a cutie mark, a violet-colored star with five small white stars surrounding it, just appeared on Twilight's flank.\nLauren Faust has suggested that there is more to Princess Celestia than has been depicted of her in the series. She says, in relation to the events of the flashback, Celestia sensed that Twilight Sparkle is connected to the Elements of Harmony and arranged the dragon-hatching test for her. Celestia then raised and trained Spike, and assigned him to be Twilight's assistant.[2]\nThe Crusaders leave a cheerfully-skipping Twilight, hopping on their cart to find Dash once again.\n Pinkie Pie unexpectedly appears inside their wagon, complete with riding helmet. She offers to tell them how she earned her cutie mark if they join her in Sugarcube Corner, to which the fillies reluctantly agree.\nIn a flashback, Pinkie is shown as a filly, living on a rock farm with her family outside of Ponyville. According to her, there is no talking and no smiling, just rocks. One day, after her family goes inside their barn without her, she hears an explosion from the sky and sees a rainbow ring. The blast of wind fluffs up her straight mane and tail. The rainbow arching across the sky gives the grey world around her color and she feels a joy that she had never felt before. She is so overwhelmed that she wants to \"smile forever\" and, even more so, wants to spread this happiness. The next day, as her family is heading out to move rocks from the south field, they hear muffled music from the silo, and Pinkie Pie beckons them inside. Her mother calls her by her full name: \"Pinkamena Diane Pie.\" Inside, there are party decorations, balloons, streamers, music, and cake. At first, the family seems completely out of its element and surprised by this \"party.\" Their expressionless faces start changing as their mouths wiggle...and they finally break into huge smiles. Pinkie exclaims, \"I'm so happy!\" as she dances with her family, and her cutie mark (blue and yellow balloons) appears.\nBack in the present, the Cutie Mark Crusaders and Pinkie reach Sugarcube Corner. Pinkie finishes her story by saying, \"And that was how Equestria was made!\" and says that she will tell them her cutie mark story on the way home. Sweetie Belle assures Scootaloo that that was just Pinkie \"being Pinkie.\" The Cutie Mark Crusaders finally find Rainbow Dash, who is with her friends. Having heard of the fillies' interest in her cutie mark, Dash tells them her story.\n Taking place where Fluttershy's story left off, Rainbow and the two bully Pegasi begin their race. They are to fly through the cloud rings toward the finish line. Rainbow Dash is already in the lead, and soon one of the bullies crashes into a cloud-pillar. Dash is bumped by the other bully and veers off course, but she catches up and takes the lead again. She tells the Cutie Mark Crusaders about how she found a love for the adrenaline and excitement of gaining so much speed. Her desire to win helps her beat the bullies and, most of all, perform the ultimate trick that was only told in legends: the sonic rainboom. She wins the race and obtains her mark: a rainbow colored lightning bolt. Rainbow Dash mentions in a previous episode, Call of the Cutie, that she was the first in her class to get a cutie mark.\n As the story ends, Dash's friends suddenly remember hearing, or seeing, that very blast from their stories. Eventually, an epiphany forms: Dash's race led to the inspiration of their goals and helped them earn their cutie marks. They believe that they were destined to be friends, even before they knew each other. They gather for a group hug, while Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle pull a reluctant Scootaloo into a group hug of their own. As Fluttershy suggests another song, Scootaloo cries out in despair.\nBy the end of the day, Spike writes Twilight's latest report of how one's connection can lead to a future friendship, while sarcastically commenting about the letter's sappiness. She simply replies, \"Just write it, Spike.\"\n"}, {"summary": " The episode opens at the Golden Oak Library with Twilight Sparkle and Spike preparing for a picnic for the centennial meteor shower. They gather stargazing equipment and pack snacks. Twilight compliments Spike for being such a reliable assistant; the compliment pleases him so much, he gets her to say it twice more. On the way out, Twilight remembers that she owns a relevant book on astronomy and asks Spike to fetch it. When he picks it up, the dust makes him sneeze fire, accidentally burning the book pages. He hides the book to avoid telling Twilight about it and lies instead, saying that someone might have borrowed it.\nTwilight believes him and they, along with their friends, set up a picnic on a hill under a starry sky. Rarity gives Spike a bow tie laden with jewels. The ponies enjoy the meteor shower and the food, but Spike falls asleep in the punch bowl.\n Twilight Sparkle tucks Spike into bed and starts writing her findings on the meteor shower. Hearing a tap on the balcony door, she looks but finds no one there. She is interrupted by another noise and a shadow that flies past the window. She opens the window to investigate, but a gust of wind blows her report out of another window. While she bemoans the fact that it would normally be Spike's task to retrieve the scroll, an owl comes in through the window, hoots at her, and drops the scroll onto her table. Twilight thanks the owl and invites it to keep her company while she works.\n The next morning, Spike wakes up in a panic, immediately noticing that he overslept. He rushes down to apologize to Twilight and make up for lost time, but she informs him that everything has already been taken care of by their \"new junior assistant,\" Owlowiscious. Spike tries to befriend Owlowiscious, but the latter only says, \"Hoo.\" Spike suspects that this new assistant is \"after [his] job,\" and warns the owl that he will be keeping a close eye on it.\nLater that day while reading a book about owls, Spike overhears a conversation of Twilight's friends outside the library. Fluttershy is fascinated by the bird, and much to Spike's dismay, Rarity gives Owlowiscious another one of her bejeweled bow ties. Seeing him take off in a huff, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy suspect Spike feels jealous, or even threatened, of the newcomer. Later, Spike tries to assist Twilight as usual, but Owlowiscious is always one step ahead of him. In one case, Spike asks around all over Ponyville to find a new quill pen, before finally managing to take a feather from a chicken. When he returns, he sees that Twilight already has a new quill: one of Owlowiscious' feathers. In a huff, Spike announces he will now do all the chores the owl hasn't finished yet, but falls asleep in exhaustion almost immediately.\n He is woken up in the next scene: Owlowiscious has found the charred astronomy book, and Twilight is very upset that Spike lied to her. He storms out of the library, proclaiming that he intends to get even with the bird.\nWhile outside, he sees a mouse scurry away and remembers that owls eat mice. He leaves the scene, only to return in a villainous disguise. He sneaks into Rarity's boutique, takes Opalescence's toy mouse, and ventures back into the library, where he intends to make a mess using the now-destroyed toy, pillow feathers, and ketchup, hoping that the owl would get blamed. But before he can finish, Twilight catches him in the act. Twilight says once more how disappointed she is and how \"this is\u00a0NOT\u00a0the Spike I know and love.\" Spike then runs away to the Everfree Forest with a bindle over his shoulder.\n Hungry, cold, and wet from a sudden rainstorm, Spike finds shelter inside a nearby cave, where he first discovers a trove of gems and then the apparent owner of these gems: a giant green dragon who is upset that Spike has been eating some of the jewels. Spike tries to reason with the dragon, citing their relation in species, but the dragon is not placated and attacks. Just as he is being cornered, Owlowiscious and Twilight arrive. With the owl's guidance, they rescue Spike and distract and outmaneuver the adult dragon before escaping into the forest. Twilight later explains that she was very worried when he disappeared, and that they followed the tracks Spike's ketchup-covered feet made.\nTwilight assures him that she only spent her time with Owlowiscious because he was awake during the night-time and because Spike is still too young to stay up late. Spike apologizes to the two for being so jealous, and Twilight apologizes in return for not being sensitive enough to Spike's feelings.\nBack at the library, rather than write her usual report, Twilight convinces Spike that he should do it. He starts to do so, but falls asleep before he can finish the report. Owlowiscious hoots, which Twilight initially mistakes for a question, and in the final shot, the owl turns its head 180 degrees and winks at the camera.\n"}, {"summary": "At the beginning of the episode, Pinkie Pie visits each of her friends and sings invitations to Gummy's one-year birthday party. When she is finished, she is exhausted and remarks to Gummy, \"Next time, I think I'll just pass out written invitations.\"\n Gummy\u2019s birthday party is held on the second floor of Sugarcube Corner. Pinkie tells Rainbow Dash and Applejack she's happy they made it to the party, and the two say they'd never miss it. Applejack bobs for apples, but bites a fake spring-loaded apple that pulls her back into the vat. When Dash emerges from the apple bob, Gummy is clinging to her face.\nRarity compliments Pinkie\u2019s punch, but spits it all over Pinkie's face when she sees Gummy dipping in the punch bowl. She forces a smiles and sips more punch, but spits it into a plant pot when Pinkie turns away. Pinkie joins Twilight and Fluttershy, who compliment her party. Pinkie accidentally knocks Twilight and Fluttershy into a wall while dancing, but later all the friends and Gummy dance together. That night, when the ponies are leaving, Twilight suggests that they \"do this again soon,\u201d and Pinkie agrees.\n The next morning, Pinkie visits the Golden Oak Library and gives Twilight an invitation to Gummy's \"after-birthday party\" that afternoon at 3 o'clock. Twilight claims she can\u2019t go because she needs to study.\nPinkie goes to Sweet Apple Acres to invite Applejack. She nervously says she can't go because she has to pick apples. Pinkie scrutinizes her for a few seconds, smiles, and says, \"Okey-dokey-lokey!\"\nThe scene changes to Carousel Boutique, where Rarity is watching Spike take out the trash. She tells him to take a shower because he smells, and he adoringly floats in the air while emitting pink heart-shaped bubbles. Pinkie comes along and invites Rarity to the party. She declines, saying she has to wash her hair. When Pinkie says her hair doesn't look dirty, Rarity dips her head in the trash and gallops back into the boutique. Pinkie reassures herself, \"A party is still a party even with only two guests.\"\n\nOutside Fluttershy\u2019s cottage, Pinkie invites Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy. Dash says they'd love to go, but they have to house-sit for \"Harry,\" a bear. Pinkie is surprised that there is a bear living in a house in Ponyville. The two Pegasi hastily elaborate on their excuse before they fly off.Back at Sugarcube Corner, Pinkie wonders how all her friends are busy. She sees Twilight sneaking into the shop and uses a tin can telephone to eavesdrop on Twilight\u2019s hushed conversation with Mrs. Cake. Twilight picks up a wrapped package and leaves.\n Pinkie puts on Groucho Marx glasses and decides to secretly follow Twilight. Twilight delivers the package to Rarity, who says she'd hate for Pinkie to \"ruin everything.\" Pinkie acquires a new disguise, a bale of hay wearing Groucho Marx glasses. In a deserted alley, Rarity transfers the package to Fluttershy. Pinkie has added a trench coat and a baseball hat to her hay disguise. When Fluttershy walks out of the alley, Pinkie tries to hop away, but Fluttershy is startled by the sight of her costume and flies away.Right then, Rainbow Dash walks by Pinkie and accidentally greets her. Demanding to know what her friends are up to, Pinkie chases Dash all the way to the Sweet Apple Acres barn. Applejack slams the door shut before Pinkie can get in. Pinkie asks to take a look inside the barn, but Applejack tells her there's construction going on and she can't come in. Angered, Pinkie leaves, and Applejack and the others sigh in relief.\n Pinkie declares that she knows who to ask about her friends\u2019 \u201csecrets and lies.\u201d The scene cuts to Spike sitting in front of a spread of gems in Pinkie\u2019s room. Pinkie shines a lamp in Spike's face while Gummy secures him to the chair by tugging on his tail. When Spike dodges her questions by giving irrelevant information, Pinkie becomes aggressive, and he asks her what she wants him to say.\nSpike repeats it and Pinkie cries, \"Ah-ha! I knew it!\" Her hair \"deflates\" and loses its curliness, and her coloration turns darker. Surrounded by darkness under a cone of light, she sadly repeats Spike's confession. She hands Spike the spread of gems.\n The scene fades in to Pinkie thanking her \"friends\" for coming to Gummy's after-birthday party. The friends are Mr. Turnip, Rocky, Sir Lintsalot, and Madame Le Flour, inanimate objects voiced by Pinkie with different accents. While making chit-chat and puppeteering the objects, Pinkie experiences strange twitches that are accompanied by musical cues and color-card backgrounds that fade in and out. At a certain point the color-card backgrounds stay, and the inanimate objects move and talk of their own accord. They convince Pinkie to never speak to her friends again. The background returns to normal to show a crazed Pinkie moving and voicing the objects. She is interrupted by a knock on the door. Rainbow Dash enters and apologizes for being in such a rush earlier. She invites Pinkie to come to Sweet Apple Acres, but Pinkie refuses and keeps playing with her imaginary friends.\n Dash ends up dragging Pinkie by her tail to Sweet Apple Acres. When they enter the barn, which has been turned into a party room, the other friends shout \"Surprise!\" Upset, Pinkie says that they threw a farewell party to kick her out of the group, and they've been lying to and avoiding her all day. The friends explain that they were keeping Pinkie's birthday party a secret. Pinkie looks around at the decorations and the cake with her picture on it and returns to her normal self. She pulls them into a group hug and the friends sigh in relief. She apologizes for doubting them, and they forgive her. Twilight narrates her letter to the Princess while she and her friends enjoy the party. Once she finishes narrating, Pinkie asks her friends to dedicate the party to Gummy too, because he's upset that his party was cut short. The episode ends with an iris wipe on Gummy playing with a balloon.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode opens with Canterlot's Grand Galloping Gala about to begin. Pinkie Pie is jumping excitedly and humorously uses a trampoline to show her enthusiasm while Twilight Sparkle is learning a new spell. Rarity comes by to stop Pinkie, not wanting the pink pony's dress to be stained with sweat. Once Applejack, Fluttershy, and Rainbow Dash meet up with the rest of the ponies, Twilight casts her latest spell, transforming an apple Spike places on the ground into a carriage to take them to the Gala. She proceeds to turn a group of four mice that Fluttershy had brought with her at Twilight's request into horses to pull the carriage. The spells are a near perfect success, except the horses' faces still had mouse whiskers. Thanks to Opalescence, however, the \"horses\" are scared away. With some eyelash batting, Rarity convinces two of her stallion neighbors, Caramel and Lucky Clover, to pull the carriage instead. As they get into the carriage, Spike is already making plans to show Twilight's friends the highlights of their hometown. They all say they will be busy but promise to hang out with him later.\nAs the seven friends finally enter the castle grounds, the Grand Galloping Gala is already underway. The ponies sing The Gala Song, revealing what they want to do during the night. After the song, the excited ponies split up in order to make their dreams a reality, leaving Spike in the dust.\nTwilight Sparkle meets with Princess Celestia, who invites her to be by her side the whole night so they can talk. Rarity lays eyes on Prince Blueblood and pursues him. Fluttershy follows the beautiful sound of a stray meadowlark into the private gardens.\nApplejack opens up her booth, filled with all kinds of apple snacks, and quickly sells her first item, an apple pie, to a Wonderbolt named Soarin. On the way to the dining areas, Soarin drops the pie and Rainbow Dash dives to save it. Recognizing her from Cloudsdale's competition, the Wonderbolt known as Spitfire asks her to hang out with them in the VIP section. Pinkie Pie arrives in the ballroom and is instantly taken in by the shiny floors, the guests, and the band.\n Pinkie Pie sings and dances in her usual fashion, expressing her love for the Gala. However, she sees that all the attention she is getting is far more strict and stern than she had anticipated, and she awkwardly becomes quiet.\nRarity finally meets her dream pony, Prince Blueblood. After introducing herself, she finds a rose in the royal garden and points it out to him. Instead of offering it to Rarity, he places it on his own suit, claiming that it compliments his eyes.\nMeanwhile, in the gardens, Fluttershy quickly follows the melody, but it leads her to Mr. Greenhooves, an elderly groundskeeper who simply loves to whistle while he works. She apologizes for interrupting and flees in the opposite direction before finally spying some exotic animals. She approaches them, only to see them scurry off. The Pegasus blames herself for being such a \"loudmouth\" and once again tries to befriend them, but no matter how polite or quiet she is, she cannot get close to any of them.\n Rainbow Dash is not faring much better, as her idols are too busy talking to other party-goers to pay attention to her. Twilight attempts to converse with Celestia, but despite the Princess's best effort to do so, the endless line of guests requires her attention. At the apple stand, Applejack has only sold one item, the apple pie to Soarin, throughout the entire episode up until this point. Refusing to give up, the girls make a vow: Rather than wait to talk to the princess, Twilight instead joins in greeting the arriving guests, but she quickly grows tired from constant hoof-shaking. Pinkie Pie decides to liven up the party by any means necessary, convincing the orchestra to play a rendition of the Pony Pokey. Dash decides to perform a few more tricks, starting by staging a save, for The Wonderbolts to see.\u00a0\u00a0\nRainbow butts an unsuspecting party guest in the air and just as fast catches him, but still she fails to attract the attention of The Wonderbolts. Meanwhile, Applejack uses some of her apples to stumble a party participant. Helping him up, Applejack offers him some of her food, but the victim refuses. Rarity keeps her composure, hoping to see Blueblood's chivalrous side. Blueblood stops her from stepping into a water puddle. Despite her expectation that he lay his coat over the puddle for them to cross, he uses her\u00a0scarf instead. As they reach the exit, she implies that Blueblood open it, but he turns his nose in the air and Rarity is forced to open it. In the garden, Fluttershy tries patience in the hope that the animals will come to her, but eventually she resorts to setting traps for them. Even\u00a0that fails.\n As the gala continues, Rarity and Blueblood approach Applejack's booth outside. Rarity orders two apple fritters. Disappointed once more when the Prince expects her to pay for the food, Applejack intervenes, giving them the fritters on the house. Upon tasting the fritter, Prince Blueblood quickly spits out the food after realizing that his royal lips touched \"common carnival fare\" and returns to the party for food of his preferred tastes. Rarity scowls at Blueblood's denouncement of her friend's perfectly good wares.\n Applejack realizes that everyone is eating hors d'\u0153uvres rather than her apple treats, and as an attempt to \"dress-up\" her fare, she decides to cart a cake into the ballroom and sell it there. Pinkie Pie, in her continuous attempts to add flair to the boring festivities, accidentally stage-dives into the cart and flings the cake into the air. The cake flies right towards Blueblood, who uses Rarity as a shield to keep himself from being hit by it. Rarity finally loses her temper and shakes off the cake pieces onto Blueblood. He retreats and accidentally bumps into the room's centerpiece statue, which begins toppling over. Rainbow Dash tries to use this opportunity to get noticed by The Wonderbolts and successfully catches the statue. Unfortunately, she can't balance it and it bumps into one of the ballroom's stone columns. It topples over and takes down the rest of the columns with it. When the dust settles, the centerpiece statue cracks and breaks.\nAs Celestia and Twilight enter the ballroom and see the destruction, Twilight resignedly comments that things cannot get any worse. At that moment, a stampede of the royal gardens' animals bursts through the door with Fluttershy behind them, enraged and ordering the animals to love her. With the ballroom in absolute chaos, Celestia has only one word of advice for her student, \"Run,\" prompting Twilight to call for her friends to follow her. On the way down the stairs, Rarity drops one of her glass slippers. Pinkie observes that Rarity's \"prince\" will be able to find her. But she doesn't want anything to do with him, so she crushes the glass slipper and runs off with Pinkie Pie.\n Meanwhile, a dejected Spike demands another doughnut while sitting at the empty counter of his favorite doughnut shop. Twilight and her friends, in their tattered gala dresses, walk in through the door. They are greeted by the server, Pony Joe, who remarks to Twilight, \"Long time no see.\" Around a table with a large plate of donuts, the ponies tell Spike the story of their night, prompting him to comment, \"That sounds like the worst night ever,\" to which they all reply, \"It was,\" with laughter. Twilight says she hopes that Princess Celestia isn't upset with them for ruining the party. Celestia enters the doughnut shop right then with the announcement that the night has been the best Gala ever, informing the ponies that the Grand Galloping Gala is \"always awful,\" which is why she hoped Twilight and her friends' involvement would liven things up. The ponies conclude that being together made a horrible night into the best night ever (and appeared to have apologized to Spike for not including him in the event).\n"}]}, {"season": "2", "eps": [{"summary": " The episode begins with Cheerilee taking her students on a field trip in the \"world-famous\" Canterlot sculpture garden. Her class consists of Apple Bloom, Diamond Tiara, Scootaloo, Silver Spoon, Snails, Snips, Sweetie Belle, and Twist. Cheerilee points out statues representing friendship and victory. When Scootaloo remarks how cool a cutie mark representing victory would be, Apple Bloom snidely says that Scootaloo is not \"victoryful\" at anything. Sweetie Belle says \u201cvictoryful\u201d is not a word, and Scootaloo indignantly asks her, \"What are you, a dictionary?\" \nCheerilee interrupts their bickering by describing a statue of a \"draconequus,\" a creature with \u201cthe head of a pony and a body made up of all sorts of things.\u201d She asks her students to guess what the statue represents. When Scootaloo guesses \"chaos,\" Sweetie Belle calls her a \"dodo.\" Apple Bloom jumps on her friends' heads and tells them they\u2019re both wrong, and the three start fighting. Above them, a small circle on the draconequus statue glows briefly. They stop fighting when Cheerilee pronounces all three correct, saying that the statue represents discord, or \"a lack of harmony between ponies.\u201d Cheerilee says that each of them will have to write her an essay about discord. As the class leaves, a large crack spreads across the draconequus statue and a cackle is heard.\n After the introduction, Rainbow Dash is flying above Ponyville when a fast-moving pink cloud sends her spinning. She discovers that the cloud is made of cotton candy, and the sky fills with cotton candy clouds that rain chocolate milk. Applejack is harvesting corn when Rainbow Dash alights and complains about the crazy weather. Suddenly, the kernels on the corn start popping, and popcorn fills the field. Pinkie Pie is delighted by the delicious abnormalities. Rarity shows up in a purple rainsuit and matching umbrella. Even as she speaks, the apples on the trees swell, making the trees sag with their weight. Applejack yells at Fluttershy to control the squirrels and rabbits who are feeding on the enormous apples, but the forest creatures' legs elongate (like the legs of creatures in Salvador Dal\u00ed\u2019s paintings [8][9]).\nTwilight Sparkle arrives with Spike, and says she has a new \"fail-safe\" spell to reverse the strange changes to the weather and animals. She casts the spell and a bright purple band of magic sweeps the land, but nothing happens. Undeterred, she tells Rainbow Dash to corral the clouds and Applejack to lasso them. Twilight instructs Fluttershy to coax the animals into eating the cotton candy clouds and popcorn instead of the apples. Not long after, Spike receives a letter from Princess Celestia, telling the six ponies to come to Canterlot immediately.\n They meet the Princess in a corridor lined with stained glass windows. Celestia explains that the strange weather is being caused by Discord, a creature that existed in Equestria long ago. Discord\u2019s rule caused unrest and unhappiness for all ponies until Celestia and Princess Luna defeated with the Elements of Harmony. However, since the two Princesses cannot wield the Elements any more, Celestia tells the six ponies that they must use the Elements once again to defeat Discord. When Twilight promises that the princess can count on them, Pinkie interrupts, saying that chaos is a good thing if chocolate rain is involved.\nPrincess Celestia opens a locked door with her horn and takes out a box, but she and the friends discover that the Elements are missing from it. Suddenly, Discord's voice echoes around the room, and he animates a depiction of himself in one of the stained glass windows. Discord comments on each element that the six friends represent, and poses a riddle:\nTwilight deduces that Discord has hidden the Elements inside the castle's outdoor hedge maze.\n As they approach the maze, Rainbow Dash confidently flies up to get a view of the maze, but her wings vanish and she crashes to the ground. A moment later, Fluttershy's wings and Twilight and Rarity\u2019s horns go missing. In a flash, Discord appears, and explains that they are going to play a game to find the Elements of Harmony. The two rules are:\nHedges spring up and separate the friends, who agree to meet in the middle of the maze.\n As Applejack tries to navigate the maze, she spots three apples, like the ones on her cutie mark, rolling away from her on the ground. She follows them to the edge of an apple orchard. Apples start falling off the trees and animating themselves; they tell her to look in a pool nearby to learn how their journey will end. She does so and sees a vision of the six friends arguing and agreeing to never speak to each other again. The camera pans up, showing Discord using puppet crosses to animate the apples. Applejack cannot accept the idea that she needs to lie to preserve her friendship with the other ponies, and Discord hypnotizes her, draining her of color. Almost immediately the orchard fades, and a section of hedge vanishes behind her, revealing Twilight. Twilight tells her friend that she heard talking, and asks her who she was talking to; Applejack denies speaking, looking around shiftily. Twilight wonders whether she lied but determines that \"Applejack wouldn't lie.\"\n Pinkie hops merrily through the maze until she stumbles upon a garden filled with balloons similar to those on her cutie mark. The balloons have smiling faces and are laughing. She giggles with the balloons until one of the balloons' strings trip her. She tumbles into a puddle of mud and stops laughing, but the balloons start jeering at her. Discord appears to Pinkie and tells her that the balloons, like her friends, are actually laughing at her, not with her. She initially denies it, but when Discord makes her friends' faces appear on the balloons, she sees that laughter can be cruel and hurtful. Discord hypnotizes her and turns her gray. The balloons pop to reveal Twilight and Applejack. Pinkie rejects Twilight\u2019s greeting and walks away. Applejack lies again, saying she didn\u2019t notice anything wrong with Pinkie. Twilight decides to pick up the pace before the stress \"gets the better of all of [them].\"\n Rarity is complaining about having to do \"outdoor sports\" when she finds a large rock blocking her path. Embedded in it are three diamonds shaped like her cutie mark. Discord appears in the diamonds' reflections and tells Rarity it's her lucky day for finding the beautiful diamonds, \"the one thing in Equestria that could rival [his] face for sheer beauty.\" He starts to hypnotize Rarity, but she resists and tries to walk away. However, she succumbs and runs back to the rock, losing her color as she chips away at the rock. She unearths what appears to be a huge diamond. As she starts to carry it away, the remainder of the rock breaks apart, revealing Twilight, Applejack, and Pinkie. Twilight\u2019s greeting is cut short when she sees Rarity carrying a large boulder. Rarity becomes very protective of her \"diamond,\" refusing to share it with the others.\n Fluttershy cautiously climbs out of the hedge she has been hiding in, and starts giving herself a pep talk. Three butterflies like the ones on her cutie mark appear. Not wanting to be left alone, she decides to follow them. The butterflies turn out to be Discord in disguise. He tries to convince her that her friends think she is helpless and laugh at her behind her back. Fluttershy accepts the fact that she is helpless and that her friends are kind enough to understand. Again, Discord tries to corrupt her, and Fluttershy resists, saying that her friends want her to know of her flaws so she can improve on them. Frustrated, Discord gives up and hypnotizes her by simply prodding her head.\nA section of hedge disappears, revealing the others. When Twilight greets Fluttershy, she insults Twilight and smacks her with her tail. Fluttershy even knocks Pinkie Pie into a hedge. As Applejack laughs at Pinkie and Pinkie retorts, Twilight realizes that something is happening to her friends. She tries to assist Rarity with moving her rock, but Rarity warns her that the rock belongs to her.\n Rainbow Dash runs through the maze and suddenly spots a cloud that looks like her cutie mark. Believing it to be her element, she chases it, only to find Discord lying on a hammock made of clouds. Ignoring Discord's attempts to be civil, Rainbow Dash tells him to prepare for a fight. Discord tells her that he is only there to deliver a riddle about the consequences of picking the wrong choice. He hypnotizes her by showing a vision of Cloudsdale collapsing. He drains her color and makes a box appear, giving her the choice of taking her wings from the box and leaving, or staying in the maze forever. Meanwhile, Twilight tries to reassure herself, saying that Rainbow Dash would never let them down. However, Applejack spots Rainbow Dash flying away from the maze. Discord appears and tells the ponies that Rainbow Dash broke the \"no wings, no magic\" rule. He declares that the game is over and says:\n"}, {"summary": " Continuing after a short recap of the first part, Twilight Sparkle,\u00a0Pinkie Pie, Applejack, Fluttershy, and Rarity argue in the remnants of the castle hedge maze in Canterlot.\u00a0When Twilight tells Discord he unfairly claimed that the Elements of Harmony were hidden in the maze, he reminds her that he never said so. Discord leaves to begin his reign of chaos, mockingly telling Twilight that maybe the \"magic of friendship\" can help her. Twilight decides to search for the Elements of Harmony in Ponyville.On the return trip to Ponyville by foot, the disgruntled ponies encounter soapy roads and long-legged bunnies. Discord reappears, announces to Twilight that Ponyville will become the \"chaos capital of the world\", and vanishes. The ponies finally arrive at Golden Oak Library, but when Twilight tries to usher her friends inside, they lose even more of their color. Rarity refuses to go inside, saying she's on to Twilight's \"plan\" to steal \"Tom\" from her. Twilight finds out that Tom is Rarity's name for the boulder. Resigned, Twilight levitates the boulder and crashes it through the door, leaving a giant hole in the wall. Once inside, Twilight asks Spike to retrieve the book about the Elements of Harmony, but her friends play a game of Keep Away with the book, keeping it out of her reach. Once Twilight finally gets her hooves on the book, she finds that all of the Elements of Harmony are tucked away inside.\nFrustrated that her friends no longer care about this discovery or the current crisis, Twilight forcefully puts the elements on Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Applejack, Rarity, and Spike, who she assigns the role of Rainbow Dash. Twilight rallies the ponies with the plan of defeating Discord so they never have to see each other again, and they all gleefully go outside, except Rarity, who has trouble pushing \"Tom\" ahead of her. Twilight angrily chucks the boulder out the window, leaving another giant hole in the wall. Discord appears outside of the library, taunting them into stopping him by making a bulls-eye appear on his chest for them to \"fire\" at. Twilight attempts to combine the elements' power to defeat Discord, with Spike standing in for Rainbow Dash, but nothing happens. As the ponies go their separate ways, Twilight's colors turn dull and she sheds a tear that splatters in the shape of a broken heart. Discord celebrates his victory as Ponyville is driven even deeper into total chaos.\n Twilight throws away her element of magic tiara and tells Spike that they are leaving Ponyville. However, Spike starts regurgitating a seemingly endless pile of scrolls from Princess Celestia, which turn out to be all of the friendship reports Twilight had sent to her during her time in Ponyville. After reading her own friendship reports, Twilight remembers the importance of friendship, regains her resolve and color, and sets out to restore the rest of her friends.\n Twilight finds Applejack at Sweet Apple Acres, and\u00a0uses a memory spell to project memories of past adventures with her friends into Applejack's mind. Applejack regains her color and goes back to her original self. She confesses that she told lies because she could not face a future of their friendship ending. Twilight then performs the same spell on Fluttershy, and Fluttershy exclaims that she just had the worst dream. Twilight restores Rarity, who tosses away the boulder and says, \"Let us never speak of this again.\" Next is Pinkie Pie, who laughs at her previous predicament.\n\n The friends find Rainbow Dash, who is still\u00a0brainwashed\u00a0and sitting upon a small cloud, believing it to be Cloudsdale. Twilight and the other ponies sneak up to a sleeping Rainbow Dash in Twilight's balloon, and Fluttershy tries to hold down Dash so Twilight can restore her personality. However, Fluttershy, now back to her kind personality, cannot take an aggressive approach and wakes up Dash to politely ask her if she can hold her down. This prompts Dash to grab onto \"Cloudsdale\" and fly away. Twilight, Rarity, Applejack and Pinkie Pie give chase in the balloon, which Fluttershy is pulling. Applejack manages to lasso Rainbow Dash, but the rope catches on Pinkie Pie and Rarity's hooves, dragging them out of the balloon as Rarity yells that Pinkie was supposed to secure the rope, still attached to the elusive Pegasus. Fluttershy is unable to keep up until she is reminded about Discord's rule over Ponyville. With that, she outpaces Rainbow Dash and the others are able to secure her while Twilight reverts Dash to her previous self.\n The friends confront Discord, who is sitting on a throne holding a glass of chocolate milk. He drinks the glass and throws away the chocolate milk, which explodes. Discord, still confident of their inability to defeat him, makes himself an open target. However, now that the six ponies can wield their elements, they combine their powers and fire a giant rainbow, just like they did when they defeated Nightmare Moon, causing an explosion much like Rainbow Dash's sonic rainboom. Discord watches in horror before he is turned to stone once more. Ponyville goes back to normal, and all chaos and disharmony caused by Discord is neutralized.\nAt the end of the episode, Princess Celestia holds a ceremony in Canterlot, honoring the ponies for defeating Discord, where a new stained glass window depicting the friends' victory is unveiled.\nAccording to director Jayson Thiessen, one of the storyboard artists decided to board the award ceremony sequence at the end of the episode as a shot-for-shot equivalent of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, though parts of the sequence were ultimately cut to shorten the episode.[3]\nThis is the last episode where Lauren Faust is executive producer, the last episode to use the original theme song, and the last episode where DHX Media is credited as \"Studio B\". This is also the first episode to not feature the My Little Pony theme in the end credits.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode starts off with Twilight and Spike walking through Ponyville, collecting items on a checklist for a picnic.\u00a0Twilight goes to pick up her order of cupcakes and finds out that Mrs. Cake added one extra cupcake whose icing was touching another cupcake's icing. Worried that her friends might get jealous of whoever gets the cupcake with the \"extra\" icing, Twilight hastily tries to \"fix\" the icing problem, leaving only a tiny amount of icing on each cupcake. Spike is left covered in frosting, which he licks off. Afterwards, they head home to Golden Oak Library, with their checklist complete. Spike points out that Twilight has not written a letter to Princess Celestia this week, causing the unicorn to panic.\u00a0\n Twilight checks her calendar and finds out it has been exactly one week since her last letter to the Princess, and is terrified of the possibility of being tardy. In a state of extreme anxiety, Twilight speculates that the Princess could punish her with an exam to prove she has been taking her studies seriously, which Twilight fears she would fail, prompting the Princess to send her back to Magic Kindergarten. Twilight envisions herself sitting in a classroom surrounded by mocking fillies, but the thought is 'popped' by\u00a0Spike as he reasons that the Princess would never allow such a thing to happen. Ignoring her assistant's words of wisdom, Twilight becomes determined to solve a friendship problem and have a letter written to Princess Celestia before sundown. She first drills Spike on his problems, but when he is revealed to have none, Twilight goes out to find a friend in need. An exasperated Spike groans and states, \"This won't end well.\"\n While looking around Ponyville, Twilight overhears Rarity crying at her shop, having lost some diamond ribbon she requires for a dress. Before Twilight can help her, however, Rarity finds the ribbon she needed, much to Twilight's disappointment. While searching for her other friends, Twilight finds Rainbow Dash, destroying an old barn on Sweet Apple Acres. Twilight, thinking that Rainbow Dash and Applejack are fighting with each other, stops Rainbow Dash. However, Rainbow Dash informs Twilight that Applejack asked her to destroy the old barn to make room for a new one, which Applejack confirms before Dash finishes off the demolition by diving into the barn and creating a colorful mushroom cloud explosion.\nStill determined to find a problem, Twilight decides to visit Fluttershy. However, when arriving at her cottage, Twilight sees Fluttershy fighting a bear and decides to back off, exclaiming, \"Of all the days she had to stop being such a scaredy-pony, she had to pick today?!\" As Twilight leaves in despair, it is revealed that Fluttershy was actually aiding the bear with a tense shoulder and giving it a massage.\n Twilight, growing more worried and rapidly becoming unhinged, starts to tearfully talk to her own reflection in a puddle, adopting two separate tones, one terrified that she will not make the deadline, the other insisting that it is still possible to solve a problem in time. She starts hallucinating small filly ponies laughing at her before Spike intervenes, revealing that the \"laughing ponies\" are just some fillies innocently playing jump rope nearby. Spike then reminds Twilight about the picnic and she heads off to meet up with her friends.\nA very agitated and slightly crazed Twilight arrives at the picnic and explains to her friends that she needs them to help her find a lesson about friendship to write about to Princess Celestia. The other five ponies brush off her issue as nothing, laughing and claiming Twilight has nothing to worry about, and she angrily runs away to continue her search for a problem.\n With the sun about to set, Twilight, now sporting a disheveled mane and an insane-looking grin, decides the only option left is to create a problem so she can solve it. She spots the Cutie Mark Crusaders playing with a ball, which begins growing until it pops with Twilight inside it, a visual gag added by Raven M. Molisee.[3] Twilight approaches the Crusaders to try and get them to take her old toy, Smarty Pants, in the hopes that the fillies will argue over who gets to play with it first.\u00a0When they instead react negatively to the doll, she casts a \"want it, need it\" spell on it, making the Crusaders want the toy so badly they resort to physical blows. She tries to break up the fight, but is unable to. She asks Big McIntosh, who is passing by, to get the doll. However, upon easily retrieving it, he too falls under the spell and runs away with the doll. Eventually, nearly all of Ponyville falls for the spell and begins to fight over the doll. The sun finally sets as Princess Celestia intervenes to undo her student's spell, returning all of the ponies to normal. She sternly instructs Twilight to meet her at the library before leaving. Twilight tearfully bids farewell to her friends, who realize they may never see her again.\n Once in the library, Twilight explains her actions to Princess Celestia while Spike overhears. Princess Celestia shows her immense faith in her student, and says that she does not require a letter every week. Twilight's friends barge in and plead for the Princess to be merciful to her student: they admit that they were wrong for denying Twilight's help when she needed it most, and they apologize. In lieu of a punishment for Twilight, Princess Celestia requests that all of Twilight's friends write her letters about friendship from now on, but only when they actually find one. Before she leaves, she tells Twilight that Spike made her aware of Twilight's fears getting the best of her, and after she leaves, Twilight gives Spike a loving hug.\nThe episode ends with all the ponies, as well as Spike, offering a collaborative report, showing that they learned about taking a friend's worries seriously, even if it does not seem so, and not letting problems go out of proportion in order to fix them.\n"}, {"summary": "The episode begins with Twilight Sparkle showing her hoof-made \"Star Swirl the Bearded\" costume to Spike. He doesn't know who she's dressed as until she tells him that Star Swirl the Bearded was the father of the \"amniomorphic spell\". Spike just looks at her blankly when she tries to remind him of the obscure unicorn history, but he is saved when four young trick-or-treaters and their chaperone, Granny Smith, ring the doorbell. Pipsqueak, dressed in a pirate costume, says that it's his first Nightmare Night festival ever. Pinkie Pie bursts forth in a chicken costume, indignantly saying that she's never too old for free candy when Twilight questions her. She thinks Twilight's costume is a great one of a \"weirdo clown\", and Spike teasingly calls Twilight \"grandpa\".\n Twilight, indignant that no one recognizes such an important historical magician, walks through the market with Spike. Pinkie and Pipsqueak meet them and show off their stashes of candy. Meanwhile, Rainbow Dash, dressed as a Shadowbolt, covertly pushes a thundercloud over Pinkie Pie and fires off a very loud lightning bolt to scare Pinkie Pie and Spike. Howling with laughter, Rainbow Dash tells a disapproving Twilight that Nightmare Night is the best time of the year for pranks. She then takes off with her thundercloud to prank another group she has spotted. Twilight and Spike meet Applejack, who is running the apple bob. The tub of water is ruined when Derpy, dressed in large paper bags, pops out of the tub with the plug in her mouth. The Mayor then makes an announcement, telling the trick-or-treaters, which include the costumed Cutie Mark Crusaders, to follow Zecora to the statue of Nightmare Moon for a storytelling. Twilight and Spike tag along.\nZecora tells the legend of Nightmare Moon and explains that Nightmare Moon requires an appeasing offering of candy. At that moment, however, Princess Luna arrives, in a flurry of dark clouds and her own royal carriage chauffeured by two of her Pegasus guards, scaring everyone off but Twilight.\n Pinkie Pie and her group of foals run through town, as a cloaked Princess Luna lands in the marketplace. Everyone bows in fearful respect of the Princess. Twilight, however, shows no fear and wants to meet her. Princess Luna makes a speech in a very strong and dramatic voice, explaining that she only seeks the love and affection of her subjects, and wishes to improve the festival and the way it portrays her. Unfortunately, her presentation only serves to further intimidate everyone. After assuring a frightened Spike that Luna is not Nightmare Moon anymore, Twilight realizes that the Princess is having trouble adjusting to modern times after being imprisoned for a millennium, and goes to talk to her. Feeling rejected, Luna leaves the market, and spends some time in front of the statue of Nightmare Moon, which is where Twilight finds her. Luna compliments Twilight on her costume, noting its accuracy to the smallest detail, becoming the first one to recognize the character. Twilight explains to Princess Luna that she was badly received due to her speaking tone and volume. Luna protests that the royal voice is the only one she knows and that she always speaks in the royal we. Twilight decides to bring her to Fluttershy, thinking that the soft-spoken pony can help Luna improve the way she addresses others.\nFluttershy refuses to answer her door at first, exclaiming that she has no candy and that she doesn't want visitors on Nightmare Night. When Twilight reassures her there's nothing to be worried about, she opens the door, only to slam the door shut upon seeing the Princess. Twilight forces Fluttershy out of her home, and Princess Luna tries to ask her how to improve her tone, but only further scares Fluttershy. As a last resort, Twilight uses her magic to engulf Fluttershy and drag her out to briefly coach the Princess. When Princess Luna feels that her tone has improved, she uses magic to haul Fluttershy over and thanks her by hugging her. Luna accidentally scares the wind out of Fluttershy, scaring off Pinkie Pie and her group of fillies once again.\n The scene cross-fades to Ponyville, where the villagers are enjoying the festivities, playing games, and dancing.\nPrincess Luna and Twilight find Applejack in the town square, and Twilight asks Applejack to give suggestions to Luna on how to be more approachable. Applejack's top tip is to have fun. Luna doesn't know what \"fun\" is, but she uncertainly tries her hoof at several carnival games. Enjoying the games, Luna shows her surprise and appreciation, and the town begins to regard her more warmly. She even goes so far as to tell her subjects to do away with the formality of \"Princess\" and simply call her Luna.\n However, when Luna rushes to save Pipsqueak from drowning in the apple-bobbing tub, Pinkie Pie mistakenly thinks she is eating the foal, and once again the ponies draw away in fear. Luna tries again to gain their trust with fun but goes a bit too far and causes havoc across the town. Fed up and offended, she declares that Nightmare Night is canceled forever. Twilight once again sets out to find Princess Luna, and finds her walking sadly across a bridge, disappointed by her inability to win the hearts of her subjects. She rejects Twilight's help at first, so Twilight finds another method. Luring Pinkie Pie into an alleyway with a trail of candy, she tells her that Princess Luna is no longer evil and instructs her to stop shrieking whenever she sees her. Pinkie Pie agrees, but as she is about to shake hooves with Princess Luna and make peace, Rainbow Dash inopportunely plays her lightning prank, making Pinkie Pie believe it is Princess Luna who made the lightning. She runs off leaving behind a purple spotted egg that looks like the one Spike hatched from in The Cutie Mark Chronicles. Twilight blocks Pinkie Pie's path by teleporting in the way and pins her down, adamantly telling her that Princess Luna has not come to harm them. However, Pinkie Pie tells her that she is fully aware that Luna won't actually \"gobble up\" anyone, but she is scared because it is fun to be scared. This inspires a plan in Twilight's mind.\nAs the ponies clean up the mess in the town square, Zecora and the Mayor remind the foals that they still have to give their offerings of candy to Nightmare Moon. Once they have left their offerings at the Nightmare Moon statue, Princess Luna makes a dramatic appearance in her dark alter-ego, scaring them yet again. She transforms back into Princess Luna and pops out a set of fake fangs, but is still afraid that Twilight's plan will fail. However, Pipsqueak then tugs on her mane to ask her something; even if there won't be any more Nightmare Nights, could she still come back next year to scare them? Princess Luna looks past him to see the other foals looking hopefully at her. To her puzzlement, Pipsqueak confirms that the way that she scared them is really fun, and Nightmare Night is his favorite night of the year. Smiling, Luna proclaims that Nightmare Night will have to be reinstated. Pipsqueak tells her that she's his favorite Princess and hugs her. He turns around and tells his friends that she agreed, and the foals cheer. Twilight tells the Princess that they really do like her after all.\nBack in town, Luna participates in more carnival games, personally accepts more candy offerings from the foals, and has fun scaring more ponies. At the end of the episode, Rainbow Dash once again shows up with her thundercloud, and when she is eagerly about to prank Twilight and Spike, Princess Luna gives her a taste of her own medicine, scaring off Dash.\nTwilight learned that one of the best things about friendship is to give it to others and help them find it themselves. Also, everyone in Ponyville learned that even if someone is intimidating or scary, when you offer them your friendship, you'll discover a whole new pony underneath.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode starts off with Rarity waking up in terror after smelling smoke coming from the kitchen. After crashing downstairs, Rarity finds the cause of the smoke: Sweetie Belle trying to make breakfast in bed for her sister and already having burned her parents' breakfast. The parents tell Rarity that they are going on their scheduled week-long vacation and they're dropping off Sweetie Belle with her for the week, to which Rarity reluctantly accepts. Once they depart, Rarity cleans up the breakfast without even eating it, and decides to make a \"proper\" breakfast. Sweetie Belle wants to help, but Rarity ignores her sister's pleas until the latter urges her kindly. Sweetie Belle is finally told to add the garnish to the plates, but Sweetie Belle accidentally flips off the table under pressure from Rarity to put it on perfectly. Ironically, the parsley sprig does manage to land perfectly on a single plate.\n Rarity huffily returns to work on her fashion line, while assigning Sweetie Belle to put away the dirty towels, to which she obliges cheerfully. Sweetie Belle decides to surprise her sister by washing the clothes, including a colorful sweater hung above the rest of the clothes. Much to Rarity's dismay the rare, one-of-a-kind wool sweater shrinks in the sun, infuriating Rarity. Although angry, Rarity bottles up her emotions and continues her work, meanwhile Sweetie Belle remains upset of her mistake. Later on, Sweetie Belle gets bored, but finds some paper and crayons and decides to draw a picture, under the premise that drawing had never gotten her into trouble before. She notes that something's missing, and uses all of Rarity's extremely rare baby blue sapphires, thinking she had more in her workroom. When a furious Rarity discovers this, she flips out again and leaves to fetch more sapphires, while Sweetie Belle cleans up the mess she made. When Rarity comes home she sees Sweetie's third mistake: cleaning Rarity's room. Rarity finally cracks and yells at her, saying that Sweetie has destroyed her inspiration for her new fashion line by cleaning up her \"organized chaos\". Sweetie Belle points out the obvious, that her sister gets upset with her whenever she makes a mistake, only to have Rarity proclaim that her own mess is exempted because it was her own. Everything Sweetie Belle has done was well-intended, but has only succeeded in making Rarity angry.\n Disappointed in her inability to do something right for her sister, Sweetie Belle then goes for a walk and meets Apple Bloom. Apple Bloom suggests she and her sister participate in the Sisterhooves Social, an annual competition in which sisters compete against other sisters in an elaborate obstacle course. Sweetie Belle invites Rarity to the event, but Rarity refuses to go on the pretense of the contest being uncouth. Sweetie Belle, while being very disappointed and angered, proclaims that she would be better off alone. In the end, the two argue, ending with Sweetie Belle telling Rarity that they aren't sisters anymore, and that each of them would be better off sister-less. Sweetie Belle heads on over to Sweet Apple Acres where Applejack is doing chores with Apple Bloom. Seeing their enjoyment as they perform tasks together, Sweetie Belle notes that Applejack, unlike Rarity, is what a sister should be - kind, patient, active, and fun.\n Later, as Rarity restarts her fashion line, she is struck by a new idea due to Sweetie Belle's organization and completes her new line, \"Full Spectrum Fashions\". She begins to forgive Sweetie Belle, but quickly stops herself, only to soften again when she finds the sweater Sweetie Belle shrank was perfect for Opalescence, and not herself. Rarity's ultimate realization of her mistake comes up after looking, a second time, at the picture that Sweetie Belle made her. While decorating a dress with baby blue sapphires, Rarity decides to take a few from her sister's picture. The picture is revealed to be an image of herself and Sweetie Belle superimposed into a heart made out of sapphires. This makes Rarity realize that what she said and did was wrong.\nRarity goes to Sweet Apple Acres in order to apologize, but finds that Sweetie is with Applejack and does not want to be with her anymore. Sweetie Belle then claims Applejack as her big sister, much to the dismay of everypony. Sweetie Belle continues berating Rarity while praising Applejack, going so far as to say that Rarity could learn how to be a better sister from Applejack. Rarity pleads for Sweetie to return, but shows that she hasn't fully learned the true meaning of sisterhood as she continues suggesting activities that appeal to her rather than Sweetie, hinting that she still does not understand. Sweetie Belle is not impressed and storms off angrier than before. Applejack helps Rarity understand what sisterhood means (comparing it to apple pie) and Rarity finally realizes that she has not been a good sister to Sweetie Belle after all, so she decides she must do whatever it takes to regain her sister.\n At the day of the event, which takes place at Sweet Apple Acres, Apple Bloom and Applejack agree that Applejack can be Sweetie Belle's sister for the day. They enter the race together, but Applejack falls into the mud of the first obstacle. Rarity emerges from the mud, wearing Applejack's hat and remaining silent throughout the race, making Sweetie Belle believe she's still racing with Applejack. Rarity's blue eyes are still visible though, as opposed to Applejack's green, though her eye style is the same as Applejack's. They manage to jump over the haystacks, quickly eat the apple pies, fill a jar with grape juice, and carefully place their egg from a hen house into a basket. While they don't win the race, only coming up short to Berryshine and Pi\u00f1a Colada, Sweetie Belle says she doesn't mind because she had so much fun. Applejack's hat falls off, revealing a white horn. Sweetie Belle wipes the mud from Rarity's flank and, after seeing her three-diamond cutie mark, discovers she'd been racing with her own sister the entire time, while Applejack stayed under the mud the entire race and only now surfaced.\nSweetie Belle finds out that Applejack, Rarity, and Apple Bloom were all in on the plan. The sisters make up, and Rarity offers to go to the spa as a treat, but the rest of the girls burst out laughing, thinking Rarity is just joking, but she insists she wasn't.\n The sisters compose a letter to Celestia together, in which they inform her that, while being sisters is wonderful, it often requires teamwork, sometimes is about compromise, sometimes is about accepting each other's differences, but mostly is about having fun. In the end, they disagree again, over whether it's okay to get one's hooves a little dirty or a lot dirty when having fun. Since Spike is writing the letter he gives them a happy medium of a medium amount of dirty (not too little, not too much, just right), and they agree on this compromise."}, {"summary": " The episode opens with the Cutie Mark Crusaders outside a bowling alley, hoping to earn their cutie marks in bowling. They briefly brainstorm new team names (since, after obtaining their cutie marks, \"Cutie Mark Crusaders\" would then be obsolete) like \"The Three Strikes\" and \"The Pin Twins\", before settling on \"The Bowling Dolls\".\nSweetie Belle rolls her ball into the gutter\u2014but remains in high spirits\u2014and Scootaloo bucks her ball and sends it flying all over the alley before it too rolls into the gutter. Apple Bloom clumsily rolls her ball and appears to knock over all of her pins. The crowd of ponies cheers, with Sea Swirl remarking, \"Cool! A bowling cutie mark!\" Apple Bloom excitedly examines her flank, which is still bare, and sees that the crowd's cheers were directed toward a colt who'd just gotten his cutie mark. To Apple Bloom's disappointment, her ball hadn't knocked over even one pin.\n Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle comment on how much fun they had bowling, while Apple Bloom dejectedly walks alongside them. Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle try to cheer her up with a cupcake from Sugarcube Corner, a party with Pinkie Pie, and a new hat from Rarity, but none of these work, and Apple Bloom remains despondent. She sulks off alone and wanders into the Everfree Forest, where she trips over a tree root, tumbles down a small ridge, and chips a tooth. Zecora finds her and brings her to her hut to give her a potion for her tooth. Apple Bloom expresses her frustration about her cutie mark, and Zecora tells her that she simply needs to wait for the right time for it to appear.\nApple Bloom takes Zecora's tooth-fixing potion, and her tooth is instantly mended. She then looks at the various potions and tonics around Zecora's hut, looking for a possible brew to bring about a cutie mark. When Zecora begins to make a potion to help a rooster fix his morning call, Apple Bloom notices a flower called 'Heart's Desire', which causes one's talent to \"come into view\" and will supposedly help the rooster crow again. Zecora goes out to find amethysts to complete her potion, and Apple Bloom sets her sights on the flower in the bowl.\n In the schoolyard, Apple Bloom exuberantly shows off her new cutie mark: a silver hoop. Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo, and Twist try to figure out what special talent her cutie mark represents, to which Apple Bloom reveals to be loopty-hooping. She demonstrates her skill at loopty-hooping and various other tricks, with other foals cheering her on, much to the annoyance of Silver Spoon and Diamond Tiara. Cheerilee\u00a0hears the foals cheering Apple Bloom on and\u00a0sees her prowess with the hoop, asking her to give the class a demonstration and help them play with hoops.\nWhile performing an advanced hoop trick, Apple Bloom suddenly sprouts a second cutie mark: an image of plates rotating on top of poles. Diamond Tiara suggests the cutie marks are fake, but Apple Bloom denies it. Snips and Snails throw her two plates and poles. Apple Bloom balances the poles on her nose and spins the plates on top while twirling a hoop around her tail. The class is astounded by Apple Bloom's talents and cheers for her as they make their way down the streets of Ponyville. In the streets, she nimbly performs tricks such as using a well-thrown hoop to style Twilight Sparkle's mane in the manner of Rarity's.\n That night, Applejack takes a tired Apple Bloom home, and Granny Smith and Big McIntosh congratulate her. Applejack tells her how proud they are of her getting not one but two cutie marks. After a long day of performing tricks, Apple Bloom heads off to bed.\nLate at night, Applejack is rolling around in bed, being kept awake by an incessant tapping. She gets out of bed to investigate and discovers that the sound is coming from Apple Bloom's room. Upon opening the door, she sees Apple Bloom tapping her hooves frantically, as well as yet another cutie mark on Apple Bloom's flank: a tapping shoe. Apple Bloom, unable to stop herself from exercising her \"talents\" all at once, cries out for help while Applejack looks horrified.\n Unable to stop Apple Bloom from moving, Applejack takes her to Twilight's library to search for a cure. Spike retrieves the book Perplexing Pony Plagues for Twilight, and locates Apple Bloom's affliction: \"cutie pox\". The book describes this bizarre disease as being \"a puzzling pony plague\" that afflicted a population of ponies in the Paleopony period. Random cutie marks appeared all over the bodies of those affected, making them perform the talents that came with them. Unfortunately, neither a cure nor the cause of the breakout was ever discovered, and the cutie pox disappeared as mysteriously as they had arrived. At that moment, Apple Bloom sprouts a fourth cutie mark in the form of a fleur-de-lis and starts to speak in French. The three ponies decide it best to seek out Zecora for help.\n While on their way to Zecora's home, Apple Bloom's cutie pox begins to progress more quickly, with each new mark causing her to perform strange and arduous talents, mostly at the same time. The townsponies become scared of Apple Bloom's strange behavior, believing her to be hexed, cursed, or enchanted.\u00a0Spike tactlessly points out the true nature of the disease to the townsponies, causing them to panic, lock themselves into their houses, and run off. When Zecora comes into town, she almost thinks that the ponies were still afraid of her. Twilight and Applejack tell her of Apple Bloom's affliction. Zecora says that around the time Apple Bloom was alone in her hut, some of her ingredients \"mysteriously\" went missing, especially the rest of a certain special flower. Fortunately, Zecora has the cure for the cutie pox: the Seeds of Truth, which only bloom when \"words true and pure\" are spoken.\nApplejack plants the seeds in the ground and pleads for somepony to tell the truth. Pinkie Pie attempts to confess to eating more corncakes than she claimed she did, but the seeds don't bloom. Apple Bloom, speaking English again, finally admits to her misdeed. She admits her cutie marks are all fake and that she stole the ingredients\u2014most importantly the Heart's Desire\u2014from Zecora. During the process, the townsponies all begin to calm down when they hear Apple Bloom's truth. Just as promised, the Seeds of Truth bloom into a flower, which Apple Bloom quickly ingests, causing her cutie pox to vanish.\nApple Bloom apologizes to everyone for the entire ordeal (including lying) - especially to Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo for getting too carried away with her cutie mark quest and to Zecora for taking her ingredients without permission. Realizing how sorry Apple Bloom is for everything and how she learned from her mistakes, Zecora and Apple Bloom's friends accept her apology.\nApple Bloom writes a letter to Princess Celestia about what she learned: there are no shortcuts to getting something you desire the most, including a cutie mark, and that good things come to those who wait.\nHowever, immediately after Spike sends the letter, the Cutie Mark Crusaders decide they've waited long enough and run off into the distance, eager to again try and get their cutie marks.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode starts with Rainbow Dash in a dream flying around in the sky, when suddenly Owlowiscious comes up and starts flying with her. Strangely, Owlowiscious' head turns into Winona's head. Then, the body turns into Gummy's body and the head turns into Angel's head. Suddenly, Opalescence pops out of Angel's mouth, scaring Rainbow into falling, which wakes her up.\nWhen Rainbow Dash wakes up, she is met by Rarity, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Applejack and Twilight Sparkle, all of whom are in the park with their pets. They tell her that they always come down to the park at the same time every week with their pets to play with them. The ponies try to make Rainbow understand why they don't invite her, but Rainbow, who is the only pony without a pet, exclaims that she understands and sees no reason for them to invite her if she doesn't even have a pet.\n However, after hearing the noise from the ponies playing with their pets, Rainbow Dash flies back down from her tree to them and says that she would like a pet at some point. Thrilled, Fluttershy brings her to her home to show off her collection of animals. Fluttershy and Rainbow break into song as Fluttershy shows Rainbow her wonderful choices of pets. Rainbow insists she wants a \"cool pet that will be able to keep up with her,\" and selects a group of flying animals but is unable to decide. To make a firm decision, she holds a series of contests to determine which pet will be hers. As she prepares to begin, Fluttershy brings in a tortoise who she says wants to compete. Rainbow reluctantly agrees.\n The first test is that of speed, a race around a track which a falcon wins. The second test is a test of agility across an obstacle course in which a hummingbird wins. The third test is of guts, where the pets have to get Opal's favorite mouse toy away from her. The butterfly easily achieves this by mesmerizing Opal into a daze, then stealing her toy. The fourth test is of style, which is done by having Rainbow pose in a snapshot with each of the animals. It is not revealed which animal passes this test. The fifth test is of coolness, where Rainbow judges the animals by their calls, of which the eagle wins. The sixth test is of awesomeness, which the owl wins because of his ability to rotate his head. The seventh test is of radicalness, in which the bat plays the My Little Pony theme song on a glass harmonica, among feats by the other contestants. At this point, the tortoise has come out last on every test and Rainbow urges him to go home.\n Still unable to choose, Rainbow decides to hold a race in Ghastly Gorge, pitting the last four contestants, the eagle, the falcon, the owl, and the bat against her, with the tortoise tagging along with the other contestants. Rainbow tells them that whichever contestant crosses the finish line with her has proven that it can keep up with her, and is worthy of being her pet. The flying pets remain very close during the race, while the tortoise is last, sweating as he tries to catch up with Rainbow. The falcon gets stuck in bramble bushes, but the bat, eagle, and owl make it through. The falcon catches up later with his wing curled up. Near the caves with the quarray eels, the bat is almost devoured but manages to get away. While distracted, Rainbow hits a wall, and there is a rock slide. The racers suddenly get ahead of Rainbow while she falls behind with her wing stuck underneath a large rock.\nShe desperately calls for help, stuck under the boulder with no one to help her. She spots the tortoise slowly approaching her, and laments about how she'll have to spend the rest of her life with the tortoise as well as being trapped by a rock. The tortoise digs a small hole under the rock and sticks his head in it. Weeping, Rainbow completely gives up hope. The tortoise, however, lifts the rock with his head, freeing Rainbow's wing.\n At the finish line, Rainbow's friends await her arrival. Noticing that only the four racers finish the race, they begin to worry about Rainbow. Applejack spots a rock slide through Twilight's binoculars, but also spots Rainbow riding on the tortoise with her right wing bandaged. Rainbow and the tortoise finish the race, and the other ponies tell Rainbow to meet her new pet, the falcon.\nHowever, Rainbow doesn't feel right with the falcon as her pet, even if it is everything she wanted. She says that her pet would be the one that finished the race with her, and the tortoise is the only one who did so. With this in mind, she accepts the tortoise as her new pet, thanking him for saving her. The sad falcon shakes hands (so to speak) with the tortoise and leaves. Rainbow then asks Spike to take a note for Princess Celestia, telling her that she learned the most important quality in a pet, or in any friend is not how cool they are or how much they can do, but is a kind of spirit that will stand by her.\n At the end of the episode, Rainbow now joins the rest of her friends in their pet playdate. Rainbow's tortoise is then shown wearing a helicopter hat, flying to the park after Fluttershy points out that Rainbow wanted a pet that can keep up with her, and she names him Tank."}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Scootaloo heading the Rainbow Dash fan club in the Cutie Mark Crusaders' treehouse. She declares that Rainbow Dash should be declared the most awesome pony in Ponyville. Snails and Snips join in the discussion with their opinion of the best way to describe Rainbow Dash. A voice suggests Rainbow Dash is super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing, which the club agrees is right. The voice is revealed to be Rainbow Dash listening to the club outside. Rainbow Dash is then seen flying around and having \"a dip in the clouds.\" Suddenly, she hears Aura shouting for help from a well. Rainbow Dash cuts short her cloud dip and saves the dirty filly from the well, and is met with large amounts of praise from other ponies, much to her surprise. Later, she sees a runaway baby carriage with a baby pony in it and quickly saves the baby from plunging off a cliff. Again, she receives a great amount of praise and is then seen being photographed by paparazzi. Realizing the fame that comes with her heroism, she goes on to save a collapsing porch holding elderly ponies and dances to the crowd's chants. She then gives a speech to the Rainbow Dash fan club in Sugarcube Corner. She brags about her new status as \"hero\" and the other main five are talking about her not being modest at all. Spike is in the corner writing Rainbow Dash's autobiography, which Twilight Sparkle reacts to by telling Rainbow Dash that an autobiography is written by who it's about. Rainbow Dash scoffs and says that she is too busy saving lives to write about her achievements, and has hired Spike as her ghost writer.\n However, her pride soon begins to get in the way of her heroic deeds, and a mysterious mare in purple steps in. She begins to steal Rainbow Dash's thunder by saving a pony from a falling hot air balloon, stopping a bus full of ponies from falling off a cliff, saving construction workers from falling debris, and fixing the dam. She then becomes the new hero of Ponyville dubbed \"the Mysterious Mare Do Well\". Rainbow Dash attempts to outshine Mare Do Well but fails, and her hatred and jealousy towards Mare Do Well grows. Every time Rainbow Dash fails, Mare Do Well steps in to fix the problem. It appears that Mare Do Well has both wings and a horn, seems to know when things are going to happen, is super strong, super fast, and incredibly agile as well. Rainbow Dash realizes that she cannot compete with that. Even her friends seem to be impressed by Mare Do Well's heroics.\nRainbow decides that she has to convince the ponies in Ponyville that she is still heroic and awesome. However, when she finds that there isn't anyone who needs saving, she ends up doing menial tasks like opening a jar of peanut butter and mowing a lawn in hope that ponies may praise her, but instead the townsponies roll their eyes and shrug her off as lame, leaving her even unhappier than before.\nRainbow goes off to brood on a thundercloud, wondering why the folk doesn't like her anymore and why she's all alone. When she hears her name called by Scootaloo, Rainbow assumes she's apologizing for forgetting about her, but Scootaloo tells her she's just inviting her to a thank you parade for Mare Do Well. At first Rainbow refuses, saying she wants to be alone, but then she hatches a plan to unmask Mare Do Well and decides to go.\n At the parade, when Mare Do Well appears, Rainbow comes up onto the stage and tries to get her to take off her mask. Mare Do Well runs away, but Rainbow gives chase. Mare Do Well keeps appearing in different places, too fast for Rainbow Dash. After a bit of chasing, Rainbow pins her down and pulls off her mask to see none other than Pinkie Pie. Astonished, she begins stammering. Then two more Mare Do Wells appear and pull off their masks, revealing themselves to be Twilight Sparkle and Applejack. They explain that they wanted Rainbow Dash to stop boasting so much and come off her high horse. Applejack stopped the runaway bus with her powerful legs, Pinkie used her Pinkie Sense to avoid the falling obstacles at the building site, Twilight used her magic to fix the dam, Fluttershy did the flyby, and Rarity designed the costumes.\nRainbow Dash understands that she should act with grace and humility and not with selfish arrogance so as to avoid losing the appreciation of the townsponies as well as causing a rift of jealousy between herself and her friends. She also learns that, while it's okay to be proud of your accomplishments, you should never brag about them.

He offers her an exclusive box seat at the Wonderbolts Derby.\nIn her room, Rarity debates whether to go to the derby. If she does, she will develop social connections in Canterlot but lose time to work on Twilight's dress. She eventually decides to attend. At the derby, Fancy Pants's guests ignore her until they learn that she is staying in the castle. To their surprise, she bets correctly on the winner of the race.

When she learns it's his birthday, she gives him a feathered white fedora and wishes him a great birthday.\nWhile walking through Ponyville, Spike reasons that when ponies learn of his birthday, they will shower him with presents. He comes across Lickety Split playing with a ball, and solicits his ball from him as envisioned. Spike then comes across Junebug and uses the birthday ploy as an excuse to ask her for the flowers she's carrying. Twilight interrupts his spiel by tugging at his \"ear\" and apologizes to Junebug for Spike getting carried away. When Twilight chides Spike, he appears to be remorseful and promises to give Cheerilee her hat back, but as soon as Twilight leaves, he puts the hat back on and asks \"Who else has a present for Spikey-wikey?\" The shot is accompanied by rattlesnake sounds, with Spike blinking with vertical eyelids and sticking out a wiggling forked tongue.\n The next morning, Twilight wakes up to find a larger, ganglier Spike sleeping under a pile of accumulated presents. He looks at his new limbs and claws, and in a brief shot from his perspective, valuable items in the library shimmer. Twilight tries to talk to him, but he gets distracted by a glistening globe. Twilight takes away the globe, but Spike grabs it back and stacks it on a pile of objects. He asks to take one of the books, but Twilight takes it away from him and comments on how grabby he is. When he replies, he finds his voice has deepened and becomes concerned about the changes.\nTwilight takes him to the pediatrician Dr. Horse and then the veterinarian Dr. Fauna, hoping to find out what's wrong with him. However, neither has any experience with dragons, while Spike continues to hoard objects. Finally, she visits Zecora, who explains:\nThe frame expands to show everything from Zecora's hut missing, the door open, and Spike missing.\n Twilight gallops back to Ponyville and finds Spike trying to pull Scootaloo's scooter from her grasp. Twilight lures him back to the library with an \"amazing broom\", and on his way, he grows larger and starts walking on all fours. She tosses the broom into one of the rooms and shuts the door; Spike struggles to break through but then goes quiet. When she comes in to check, she finds him clutching a pile of books. She removes all the books and closes the door again, but then she hears loud crashing noises and finds a Spike-shaped hole in the library wall, with Spike gone again. The scene wipes to Applejack wondering \"Now who in Ponyville would steal my apples? For that matter, who would steal my leaves?\" Twilight rushes to her and asks for her help to lasso Spike. Applejack laughs at the idea of Spike running wild, but then he runs past them with a pile of leaves and apples.\nTwilight and Applejack chase Spike with a length of rope and lunge at him, but they miss and manage to tie themselves to a tree while Spike continues rampaging. Rainbow Dash spots them and laughs at their predicament when Fluttershy's distant scream cuts her short. The three find her hiding in a tree, and she tells them \"a giant, rampaging dragon stormed through\", who pulled her chicken coop out of the ground and filled it with \"apples and stuff\".\n The ponies next hear Pinkie Pie scream, and they find her pelting Spike with cakes while he collects some of them into his chicken coop of stuff. Spike grows so large that he crashes through the ceiling of Sugarcube Corner. As the others chase after Spike, Applejack tows Pinkie along by the tail, who\u00a0can only stare in shock at her half-destroyed workplace. While Rarity tries on her cape at Carousel Boutique, Spike's gigantic eye peeks through the window, and he reaches in to kidnap Rarity. The scene fades to alarm sirens going off, which Spike grabs. Ponies panic in the streets of Ponyville while Spike rampages and tears off the top of a water tower to stash his hoard in it. He roars at Rarity, who he has held captive with the end of his tail. Rainbow Dash hovers on one side of Spike, screaming at him to let Rarity go, while Fluttershy politely entreats him on the other side. Spike refuses to listen to them, turns around and swings Rarity at them. Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy get caught up in Rarity's magenta cape, which tears off, sending the two falling into a river.\nThe Wonderbolts fly overhead and make some close fly-bys to Spike, accompanied by the sound of polishing blades. Spike spots a nearby steep mountain and climbs it, Rarity dangling along. The Wonderbolts fly even closer to him and one of them shaves off some of Spike's spines with sheer speed. Spike empties the water tower tank into a cave,\u00a0uses it to catch the Wonderbolts,\u00a0then lodges the tank into the side of the mountain to trap them inside.\n Rarity launches into an angry diatribe, culminating in taking the remnants of her ripped cape and declaring it a \"crime against fashion\". Spike notices the fire ruby that she is wearing, and Rarity, seeing that it got his attention, tells him she won't let him have this gemstone: \"This was given to me by my dear friend Spikey-wikey... the kindest, sweetest, most generous dragon ever. And it is too precious to me to give to a greedy old beast like you!\" Spike looks at the gem wide-eyed and flashes back to the moment when he gave her the ruby and how she kissed his cheek. He touches his cheek and starts quaking, then winces and zaps into his old self. The tiny Spike and Rarity remain airborne for several seconds before plummeting. Rarity, shocked, realizes that Spike was the rampaging dragon.\nSpike tries to confess about his crush, but Rarity stops him and smiles, her eyes welling with tears and Spike smiles back. Meanwhile, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy speed towards the two with the ripped cape from the river and catch Spike and Rarity in the air, safely lowering them to the ground. With the emergency over, the shot cuts to the water tank on the mountainside which peels off revealing the Wonderbolts huddled together, shivering. They notice that the tank fell off, strike a gallant pose to the sound of a hunting horn, and fly off.\n Spike sits sadly on the bridge and places his hand in one of the giant footprints he made. Rarity comes up and says she's proud of him for stopping himself from destroying Ponyville, calling him her hero and giving him a kiss. The scene cross-fades to Spike narrating and writing a letter to Princess Celestia about the values of kindness and generosity, which are \"more valuable than anything in the world. Well... almost anything.\" He turns to face the other way to reveal his cheek to the camera with Rarity's kiss framed like a picture. The episode ends with a kiss-shaped iris wipe on Spike's cheek.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode starts with a shot of a snowy Ponyville and the six friends on a train on their way to Canterlot. Once they arrive, Twilight Sparkle expresses her delight at Canterlot at this time of year, with Rainbow Dash agreeing and wishing that it could be Hearth's Warming Eve every day. Scootaloo\u00a0makes a cameo appearance, during a game of \"I Spy\".\nNext, the ponies are seen backstage preparing for the play that Princess Celestia asked them to perform. Fluttershy suffers from stage fright, which is not helped when Rarity tells her that hundreds, maybe thousands of ponies will be watching. Rainbow Dash, in contrast, thinks that the show should be all about her, since she's the star. Meanwhile, a window is open causing a cold wind to blow through backstage. Rarity asks Applejack to close the window, but Applejack chides Rainbow Dash about the true meaning of the play. Eventually, Spike comes to inform the ponies that curtain is in two minutes, while the argument over who should close the window continues.\nThe episode features a play put up by the ponies in Canterlot for Hearth's Warming Eve. The cast and crew are as follows:\nThe ponies are then called on stage, and the play begins. The play is about the history of ponykind and how Equestria was founded. Spike narrates, providing an introduction. He explains that the Earth ponies grew food, and in payment for providing weather, the Pegasi demanded some of the food. The Unicorns also demanded payment for magically raising the sun and moon. None of the tribes cared what happened to each other. This fragile relationship continues until a large blizzard comes along causing a food shortage.\n Without any food, the leaders of each pony tribe meet up to discuss what to do. The meeting however goes poorly, as each of the leaders continues to argue with each other. After the assembly, three ghostly horses are shown overlooking the Earth below from a passage in the clouds; they are later identified as windigos. Each of the leaders returns to their second-in-command and explains that the meeting went poorly because the other leaders refused to cooperate. Smart Cookie then tells Chancellor Puddinghead that they are out of food, and Chancellor Puddinghead exclaims \"I am just about to be brilliant!\" She decides that they need to grow food somewhere else, and each leader comes to the conclusion that they must find new land to inhabit.\n Commander Hurricane and Private Pansy fly through clouds, while Princess Platinum and Clover the Clever travel through a forest, and while Chancellor Puddinghead and Smart Cookie travel across a gem-encrusted mountainside. Each tribe leader finds their ideal land, and claims it for their tribe. Commander Hurricane names her land \"Pegasopolis.\" Princess Platinum naming her land \"Unicornia,\" and Chancellor Puddinghead naming her land \"Earth\" as a recommendation from Smart Cookie to replace her first choice of \"Dirtville.\"\nThey soon discover that each tribe has claimed the same land, and of course more arguments ensue about who gets to own the land. Commander Hurricane calls for a fight to the land, but each of the advisers votes for everyone to just calm down. Chancellor Puddinghead throws snowballs at Commander Hurricane and Princess Platinum, causing everyone to realize that the blizzard has once again returned.\n To escape the blizzard, the ponies make their way into a cave. Once in the cave, they continue to argue over who gets what part of the cave. Due to their constant arguing, the windigos once again return, causing an ice blizzard, which freezes each of the leaders solid. Clover the Clever identifies the creatures, saying her mentor Star Swirl the Bearded taught her about them. The advisers, however, manage to hold good relations to each other, regardless of the different tribes they hail from. They deduce that the leaders' arguing is what caused all of this, and tell stories and sing, the songs of which became the carols that are still sung in Equestria today.\n With their continued display of friendship, Smart Cookie, Clover the Clever and Private Pansy manage to melt the ice\u00a0surrounding their leaders and incinerate the windigos through the magic of the Fire of Friendship. In the end, all the tribes learn that the warmth of harmony and love to each other can conquer over the coldness of hatred and grief. After the leaders settle their differences, they all finally live in harmony with each other while founding the new land, Equestria. The ponies raise a banner bearing two Alicorns, which bear a resemblance to Princess Luna and Princess Celestia, depicted flying with the Sun and Moon. At the end of the play, the cast and audience begin to sing a carol. Once the play is over, backstage, Twilight concludes that the Princess chose them to perform the play because they exemplify what good friends are. They then notice that the window is still open (or open again), and then they all start arguing about who will close the window. However, when they hear a sound that sounds like the distant wail of a windigo, Rainbow Dash volunteers to close the window, without further argument. The episode ends with a shot of Canterlot with the same magical heart floating above it that broke the blizzard in the cave in the play.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode opens at night time in Sweet Apple Acres with a wolf's howl. Soon Applejack wakes up to the clanking of pots and pans, and she is joined by Apple Bloom, who looks out the window with her. Outside, Granny Smith is running around shouting \"the timberwolves are a-howlin'\" and \"the zap apples are coming.\" Looking out from their windows, Applejack, Apple Bloom, and Big McIntosh cheer and repeat that the zap apples are coming.\nThe following morning Applejack and Big McIntosh are making preparations at the apple orchard, unloading large baskets by the bare trees. Inside the Apples' house, Apple Bloom enthusiastically exclaims to Granny Smith that she's ready to make zap apple jam. Granny Smith starts by giving Apple Bloom a stick with some twigs tied to its end, prompting Apple Bloom to inquire if it is some special herbal ingredient she uses, but Granny Smith replies that it's a broom and that she should start sweeping.\nAt the orchard, a strong wind starts blowing and the skies get covered with dark clouds. The naked trees starts buzzing with blue sparks around their branches, and soon the sparks disappear and big leaves sprout, which Applejack calls \"zap apple leaves\".\n The storm clouds quickly disperse and Diamond Tiara and her father Filthy Rich arrive at the farm. They watch Granny Smith and Apple Bloom jump over full watering cans singing the alphabet while wearing bunny costumes. Filthy Rich is there to do business with Granny Smith about the jam. Diamond Tiara tells Apple Bloom she must be \"so embarrassed\" by Granny Smith's \"silly ways\" and ridiculous costumes, and that she's lucky she's on the farm and not in town where everyone could see her.The scene fades to Apple Bloom and Granny Smith in town gathering ingredients for the zap apple jam. Granny Smith sings loudly and hops along, drawing the attention of other townfolk, which makes Apple Bloom lower her head in embarrassment. Granny Smith inspects some pots and pans at a stand and chews on one of them, and leaves her false teeth attached to it then carries along. She makes smalltalk with the bees while harvesting their honey. Apple Bloom begs her grandmother to stop acting that way when Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon spot them. The fillies derisively call Apple Bloom by the nickname that Granny Smith gives her, which makes her bury her head in shame and eventually beg Granny Smith to get back to the farm. Granny Smith keeps singing and prancing, and Apple Bloom pulls down her bonnet over her eyes, embarrassed.\n The next scene has Filthy Rich giving a lecture about his business at the schoolhouse in front of a bored, half-asleep classroom\u2013except Diamond Tiara, who is alert and attentive. He concludes his lecture and Cheerilee thanks him for being a part of Family Appreciation Day, first as \"Mr. Filthy\", but he frowns and Cheerilee quickly corrects herself to \"Mr. Rich.\" Cheerilee checks her her list for the student up for the next Family Appreciation Day, and names Apple Bloom. Apple Bloom tells her that Applejack and Big McIntosh will be too busy to come and speak because it's zap apple harvest day. Cheerilee asks if anyone else from her family could come, and Apple Bloom nervously shakes her head no, but Diamond Tiara butts in and exclaims that Granny Smith could come. Apple Bloom tries to say something, but Cheerilee quickly accepts the offer. Apple Bloom is horrified and whines to herself that she'll be the laughing stock of Ponyville.\nBack at the farm, Applejack tells Apple Bloom she and Big McIntosh can't take a break from the harvest. The third sign manifests in a quick change in weather, a flock of crows circling the orchard in a flight pattern of an apple, and the blossoming of teal flowers on the zap apple trees. When the sign concludes, Applejack assures Apple Bloom that Granny Smith has no shortage of entertaining stories to tell.\n The scene cross-fades to the Cutie Mark Crusaders' treehouse, where Apple Bloom shares her woes with her friends Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle in a long string of synonyms. Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo tell Apple Bloom they'll help her postpone her presentation, trying tactics like faking an illness for Apple Bloom, manipulating a napping Granny Smith to say that she won't be able to make the presentation to Cheerilee, trying to harvest the zap apples early (while they get to feel the trees' magic defense), and sending Granny Smith on a train journey to see Uncle Apple Strudel. The last attempt works, and Granny Smith goes to visit Apple Strudel.\nThe scene cross-fades to the schoolhouse, where Cheerilee welcomes Granny Smith for Family Appreciation Day, but she doesn't arrive. Apple Bloom explains that Granny Smith got called out of town on account of a family emergency, but right as she finishes the sentence Granny Smith enters the classroom. Apple Bloom, surprised, asks Granny Smith if she missed the train, and she replies that it came and Uncle Apple Strudel was on it. Diamond Tiara makes a snide remark about Granny Smith's memory to Silver Spoon, and afterwards Granny Smith starts her presentation.\n Granny Smith tells the class that she and her family were \"pilgrim ponyfolk\" who traveled and collected seeds. In her story, \"the Smith family\" reaches Canterlot and comes across Princess Celestia, who stops to see their seed collection, and notices they're tired from searching for a home. She directs them to the land next to the Everfree Forest; Granny's father is so grateful\u00a0that he raises Celestia's hoof and kisses it (but perhaps\u00a0for a bit too long than his wife appreciates, if her glaring at him is any indication).\u00a0\u00a0There they build their first home with lumber from the surrounding forest and plant their first orchard, but since orchards don't grow overnight their food runs scarce. Despite having been warned of the dangers of the Everfree Forest, as her family sleeps Granny Smith decides to venture into it after dark in search of food, having reasoned that there must be food sources that support the animals living there. She soon came across a zap apple tree which just happens to be laden with ripe fruit. Having filled her saddle bags at this point, a pack of timberwolves found her and began to howl and chase after her. Granny Smith runs back to her house and begins clanging a metal pot against the cooking cauldron her mother set up outside, which drives the timberwolves away. The family takes the seeds from the zap apples and plants them in their orchard; the seeds magically grow into full size trees in an instant.\nGranny Smith then goes on to describe the how she paid attention to the signs of the harvest of the zap apple trees each year, how the apples all zap away if you don't pick them all in one day, and how she mixed up batches of zap apple jam. The process would come to involve the strange activities she was exhibiting earlier in the episode: being friendly with the bees so their honey would be sweet, talking to glass jars to make sure they won't crack, and that \"zap apples like pink polkadots\". As to exactly why it improves the jam, she came to chalk it up to the magic apples themselves and that magic is just funny that way.\u00a0She tells that ponies started coming to the farm from far and wide for the zap apple jam, and that the first thing Diamond Tiara's great grandfather Stinkin' Rich ever sold was her zap apple jam. He would stay in the area to open a permanent store, and this came to attract more ponies to relocate to what would become the town site. She concludes, \"and that is how Ponyville was founded.\"\n Granny Smith's account of Ponyville's founding agrees with the account given in Winter Wrap Up by Twilight Sparkle, where she tells Spike that Ponyville was founded by Earth ponies. After Granny Smith finishes her story, Silver Spoon kicks off a round of applause, to which everyone joins in. Diamond Tiara is shocked at the attention Granny Smith has received, and lashes out at her, but Apple Bloom rushes to defend Granny Smith. At the end of the episode, Apple Bloom tells Applejack that Family Appreciation Day went well and she learned that she should always appreciate and be proud of her family and friends, even if they may seem different.\nThe episode ends with Filthy Rich,\u00a0sternly pushing Diamond Tiara, wearing a big pair of bunny ears, to go and join in with other\u00a0foals from school in singing to the water in the\u00a0watering cans.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode starts with Pinkie Pie, Applejack, Rarity, Fluttershy, Twilight Sparkle, and Rainbow Dash looking down on the newborn baby nursery of the Ponyville Hospital. Mr. Cake shows his new Pegasus son, Pound Cake, and his new unicorn daughter, Pumpkin Cake. Pinkie Pie goes into the nursery to start celebrating, but is soon reprimanded by Nurse Redheart several times to be quiet so she doesn't wake up the other babies (eventually to the point of being kicked out of the nursery). After Applejack asks how Pound Cake is a Pegasus and Pumpkin Cake is a unicorn, Mr. Cake explains why he has unicorn and Pegasus children even when he and Mrs. Cake are Earth ponies by saying that distant relatives of theirs were Pegasi and unicorns.\n A month later, Pinkie Pie brings the babies a one-month celebratory cake and song. After singing to the babies and popping out of their cake, she plays peek-a-boo with them. Shortly after that, Mr. Cake changes their diapers, and Mrs. Cake brings them their bottles to feed them. After Mr. Cake burps the babies, they both run off to play with Pinkie again.After being reminded about food, Mrs. Cake remembers a large catering order to complete. However, they need a babysitter. They ignore Pinkie Pie's requesting to babysit, and begin their search by asking Fluttershy. However, Fluttershy declines, saying she promised to go on a picnic with Angel. They then ask Twilight, who also declines because she is busy summarizing her reports to send to Princess Celestia. Applejack declines because she is too busy saving her apples from a swarm of ravenous caterpillars. Rainbow Dash declines because she has tickets to the Wonderbolts air show. When Mr. and Mrs. Cake ask Rarity, however, she simply refuses with no given reason to her decline. Finally, they oblige to let Pinkie Pie babysit their children.\nThe Cakes leave Pinkie Pie a big list of what she needs to do. After they leave, Pinkie Pie is immediately left with two crying babies to deal with. She tries to cheer them up with some more peek-a-boo, and pulling a face. She then begins a pseudo-standup comedy show, and begins telling jokes. While this seems to calm them down to begin with, they start crying at Pinkie's second joke. Pinkie Pie resorts to singing a quick song and dancing around her stage, but this has no effect as the babies begin crying during the song. Falling over, Pinkie Pie accidentally knocks a bag of flour off the top of the refrigerator, which empties on her. This manages to make the babies laugh.\n At snack time, Pinkie Pie brings the babies their prepared meals, only for Pumpkin Cake to start eating the tablecloth and for Pound Cake to end up with food on his head. Pinkie Pie then tries to give the two babies a bath, and has trouble to get them into the tub. Once they are in the tub, she manages to keep them shortly entertained by blowing bubbles with the soap. This is short-lived, since they start crying again after she buries them in tub toys. After they get Pinkie wet, she brings in another bag of flour but begs them not to make her use it. The Cake twins continue crying, forcing Pinkie to dump the flour over her wet body, turning it into dough.\nPinkie Pie then needs to change the babies' diapers after noticing the smell. After cornering and wrestling with the twins, she ends up with the two diapers on her instead. Twilight then arrives and offers help to Pinkie Pie, who is more than happy to accept. However, Twilight then says that she expected that Pinkie would need help, and implies that Pinkie Pie is not cut out to handle the workload and responsibilities of babies. Feeling insulted, Pinkie Pie tersely thanks Twilight for dropping by, pushes her out the door, and shuts it in her face. Pinkie huffs behind the door that Twilight would think that she can't handle the situation on her own, but then she admits that perhaps that's because she hasn't experienced this situation before. She resolves to do so, and on her own.\n Determined to prove that she is a responsible pony, Pinkie Pie begins to be assertive and stops Pound Cake jumping on his crib and Pumpkin Cake from chewing on a toy. Setting\u00a0Pumpkin Cake beside her brother in his crib,\u00a0Pinkie tells the babies that it's time for their naps and to go to sleep, and unexpectedly, they comply immediately and fall asleep. Tucking them in, raising the safety rail and tossing the toy into the closet, Pinkie Pie leaves the room, but when she turns around to close the door, she sees that they have disappeared.\nShe immediately starts to search for them, and quickly finds Pumpkin Cake chewing on\u00a0the toy in\u00a0the closet. She is shocked to find Pound Cake walking on the ceiling using his wings. Pinkie uses suction cup boots to get Pound Cake down, but\u00a0is then\u00a0utterly flabbergasted to witness Pumpkin Cake using her magic to move a bunch of toys from her crib\u00a0to chew on. When Pinkie Pie puts these away, using a chain and padlock on the toybox for good measure, she grabs on to Pound Cake to stop him flying around, but she ends up getting dragged around down to the kitchen and storefront, knocking over all sorts of baked goods before being dragged back upstairs. Pumpkin Cake\u00a0then figures out how to levitate herself. Now faced with two flying foals, Pinkie traps them under a play pen and tapes it to the floor, only for Pumpkin Cake to make the side intangible to walk through, while Pound Cake\u00a0flies upward to break the tape.\u00a0Pumpkin Cake uses her telekinesis to break the padlock and promptly chews on a toy while Pound Cake zooms around the room.\u00a0\n Frazzled, stressed out,\u00a0and feeling completely overwhelmed, Pinkie Pie bursts into tears. The twins feel bad of what they did and manage to cheer Pinkie Pie up by telekinetically covering themselves in flour. After that, she manages to get the twins to fall asleep in Pumpkin Cake's crib. Pinkie Pie writes a letter to Princess Celestia, saying that being a caregiver means more responsibility than just being a playmate, and that sometimes our desire for responsibility can outrun our actual ability to handle it.\nAfter cleaning everything up, Mr. and Mrs. Cake return home. Expecting the place to be a mess, they are astounded by the immaculate condition of their home, and praise Pinkie Pie for her unexpected level of responsibility. They ask her if she wants to be their permanent babysitter, but Pinkie Pie turns them down, saying that she \"should be available a week from... never!\" But once she hears the twins utter her name as they sleep, she has a change of heart and says she has some free time next Tuesday.\n"}, {"summary": "Apple Bloom watches her sister, Applejack, jump over hurdles and shot put a bale of hay in a practice obstacle course. Apple Bloom is confident that her sister will win the Equestria Rodeo Competition. When Applejack responds modestly, Apple Bloom says that she is the ten-time rodeo champion of Ponyville and holds more blue ribbons than any pony in town. The filly says that she can't wait for her sister \"to win every blue ribbon in Equestria and bring home the title of Equestria Rodeo champion!\u201d  Outside Ponyville\u2019s town hall, Derpy tries to help Rainbow Dash set up a banner but ends up wrecking a part of the building. At a send-off outside town hall, Mayor Mare announces Applejack's participation in the Equestria Rodeo competition in Canterlot and thanks Applejack for generously offering up her prize money to fix town hall. In turn, Applejack thanks the citizens for supporting her in every rodeo ever since she was little. She promises to make Ponyville proud and the crowd cheers. The scene cuts to the Apple family and friends saying goodbye to Applejack on the train platform. A week later, Applejack\u2019s friends and family are waiting for Applejack to come home to a surprise party in the Sweet Apple Acres barn. However, a mailpony shows up to deliver a letter from Applejack. Amazed, the mailpony asks, \"How did you know it was my birthday?\" In the letter, Applejack says that she will send the prize money but will not be returning to Ponyville. Saddened by the news, Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, and Rarity assure the Apple family that they will go to the rodeo to ask Applejack why she won't be coming back. The friends also tell a crying Big McIntosh that they will search all of Equestria for Applejack if they must.\n The five friends go to the rodeo and show a picture of Applejack to the ponies there but to no avail. Luckily, a mare points them in the right direction. The friends take a train to a town called Dodge Junction. After they disembark, Pinkie Pie inadvertently finds Applejack in a nearby restroom. Applejack explains that she has been working at a cherry farm run by a pony called Cherry Jubilee. Cherry Jubilee shows up and recounts how Applejack was looking for \"a change of scenery.\u201d Applejack asks her friends to go home without her and tell her family that she's doing fine. The friends believe that Applejack is not telling the whole truth.\n In the factory, Applejack uses a treadmill to power a conveyor belt transporting yellow and red cherries. Applejack frowns when her friends are hired to be red/yellow cherry sorters. Twilight takes the opportunity to ask Applejack what she thought of Canterlot and the rodeo. Rainbow Dash joins in, asking if she saw Wild Bull Hickok and Calamity Mane. Rarity also leaves her post and inquires how Applejack met Miss Jubilee. Applejack curtly responds that she befriended Miss Jubilee at her cherry stand at the rodeo.\nApplejack becomes irritated by her friends\u2019 incessant questions and moves the conveyor belt too fast for Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie. In an attempt to handle the onslaught of cherries, Pinkie Pie stuffs their saddlebags and then her own mouth with cherries.\u00a0Fluttershy cries \"STOP!\" and Applejack skids to a halt. The cherries fly off the conveyor belt and cover Applejack with cherry juice.\nThe five friends are then seen mopping up the juice on the floor and walls. Calling for drastic measures, Rainbow Dash says it's time to \"call in the big guns,\" and the camera dramatically zooms in on Pinkie Pie.\n When Applejack is bucking cherry trees, Pinkie Pie asks her if she needs some help, promising to not ask any questions. Pinkie Pie starts babbling about cherry-based dishes and fun things to say, such as \"chimicherry,\" \"cherrychanga,\" \"kumquat,\" and \"pickle barrel.\" Overwhelmed, Applejack begs her to stop. Rainbow Dash, who is wearing earplugs, tells Applejack that the only way she can stop the madness is to spill the beans. Applejack finally agrees to tell the truth tomorrow at breakfast, and when Pinkie doubts her, she gives a Pinkie promise.\n The next morning, the five go to Applejack's bedroom, but nobody is there. Pinkie Pie is enraged because Applejack broke her Pinkie promise. Meanwhile, Applejack is waiting at the Dodge Junction train station with her luggage. When she sees her friends running towards her, she jumps on a coach and orders the four ponies pulling the coach to run away. The friends start chasing Applejack in a cart pulled by Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy. Just as they are approaching Applejack, Fluttershy suddenly comes to a halt to avoid hitting a rabbit. When they catch up to Applejack again, Pinkie Pie leaps into her coach to ask why she broke her Pinkie promise, but Applejack insists that she didn\u2019t break the promise because she did not go to breakfast. Pinkie Pie accepts her excuse and jumps backwards into the wooden cart, saying, \"Rarity, catch me.\" Taken aback, Rarity is knocked off the cart, and both of them tumble off. Twilight tells the Pegasi to go back, but Rainbow Dash refuses. The ponies see a train hurtling down a railroad track stretching across their path. The coach ponies doubtfully look at Applejack, but she whips them, and their coach crosses the track, narrowly avoiding the oncoming train. Applejack jumps off and says, \"Yee-haw!\", but the coach ponies say, \"Lady, you're trouble,\" before driving away.\n Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash fly over the train, and Rainbow Dash tackles Applejack upon landing. A bunch of medals spill out of Applejack's bag and Twilight compliments Applejack, but she despairs because she didn\u2019t win a single blue ribbon nor any prize money. She explains that she tried to earn money on the cherry farm so she could send home the money she promised. Twilight contradicts Applejack's belief that she is a failure and Rainbow Dash says that as friends, they wouldn't care even if she came in fiftieth place. Fluttershy chips in, saying that the hole in town hall can always be repaired but not the hole in their hearts if Applejack never comes back. Rainbow Dash quietly cries and says, \"Darn it! Now you got me acting all sappy!\"\n Applejack learns that there is no reason to hide when you don\u2019t do as well as you had hoped. Instead of running away from your problems, you should turn to your friends and family. \nWhen Applejack comes off the train in Ponyville, her family and Winona hug her. The episode ends when Rarity and Pinkie Pie, who were left behind during the chase, use a hoof-powered railroad cart to travel home. Pinkie Pie still compares the words \"chimicherry\" and \"cherrychanga,\" and Rarity mutters that Rainbow Dash will get it when they return.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode opens with a shot of Fluttershy sleeping. She is soon awoken by Rainbow Dash, who drags her to Sweet Apple Acres in order to be there early for the opening day of cider season. Dash complains that Pinkie Pie is always first in line and always buys an unfairly large amount of cider. She says that this time she intends to beat Pinkie to the head of the line by lining up before dawn. As they arrive, however, they see a massive queue of ponies camping out to get cider and Dash worries that there won't be enough for her. They meet up with Pinkie Pie, who is once again first in line. She says that she \"had this brilliant idea to come down here and camp out,\" and she, \"told a few others about it and they all thought it was a great idea too.\"\nApplejack then announces that cider season is open and Apple Bloom begins to serve draught apple cider to ponies individually as they come down the queue, while Granny Smith receives payment. Pinkie Pie buys not just one mug of cider but a whole trays' worth. As the serving goes on, the barrels of cider left for Big McIntosh to tap decrease, and Fluttershy, who is just one place in front of Rainbow Dash, gets the last\u00a0mug of cider for the day. Extremely upset by this, Rainbow Dash and the other ponies who didn't get cider begin to complain. Applejack explains that there will be more cider tomorrow, and that while they always manage to improve production every year, the family recipe is made with love and care and can't be rushed. The crowd, however, is still angry and complains that the Apples always run out of cider before everyone is served.\n Amidst the chaos, the Flim Flam brothers arrive in their large vehicle, which they later reveal to be named the \"Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000.\" They kick off a long musical number as soon as they arrive, and sing about their production of cider. Managing to entice the entire crowd into joining in their song, they quickly make themselves popular.\nThey use this popularity to their advantage. With Ponyville's citizens faced with the dilemma of a limited quantity of manually pressed cider, they turn to the Flim Flam brothers and their automated cider production. Upset by the arrival of the Flim Flam brothers and the threat of automated production running them out of business, the Apple family tells them that their hoofmade cider will never be outshone by anything automatic.\n The twin brothers attempt to broker a deal with the Apple family, who will supply them with their delicious apples, and they will sell the cider under the Flim Flam brothers name. They call for a 75-25 split in profits in their favor. Applejack\u00a0reminds\u00a0the others that their cider profits keep the family business afloat during the winter months; if they were to accept, they would lose the farm. The Apple family\u00a0declines the offer, which prompts Flim to state that if the Apple family refuses to partner up with the brothers, they will run the family out of business and out of Ponyville.\n The next day, cider season is in full kick again. The Flim Flam brothers once again arrive after the cider has run out and attempt to sell their own cider. However, Applejack lassos a barrel of their cider away, saying they can't sell cider made from Apple family apples. Rainbow Dash, about to drink her glass of cider, has it knocked away by the barrel. She ends up eating the dirt it spills over into. Hearing Applejack say that the Flim Flam brothers can't sell their cider, Rainbow asks if Applejack is playing a \"cruel joke\" on her.With the Apple family confident that their hoof-made cider will always be better than the Flim Flam brothers' automatically produced cider, the Flim Flam brothers challenge them to a duel of who can produce the most barrels of cider in one hour. Reluctant at first, Granny Smith tells them they won't compete. However, after being called chicken, she agrees to a competition.\n The two parties meet up at Sweet Apple Acres. The Mayor and Dr. Hooves kick off the competition, and the two teams begin their work. For the Flim Flam brothers, it's as easy as pressing a button. However, the Apple family immediately gets into the task, with Applejack bucking trees, Apple Bloom collecting the apples, Granny Smith sorting them, and Big McIntosh running the treadmill press and casking the cider.Inevitably, the Flim Flam brothers' automated production line far outpaces the manual production of the Apple Family by three barrels to one. Fortunately, Applejack's friends arrive, naming themselves honorary family members and asking the mayor if they can participate in the event. Mayor asks the Flim Flam brothers if they care, and after they say they don't since they'll win anyway, she lets Applejack's friends participate.\nTwilight Sparkle assigns her friends their tasks. Fluttershy helps Applejack with picking by zipping among the branches and shaking the entire crown, while the acrobatic Pinkie Pie helps Apple Bloom with collection. With her eye for detail, Rarity helps Granny Smith with sorting. Rainbow Dash uses her energy and stamina\u00a0alongside Big McIntosh\u00a0to power the press, and Twilight takes over for Big Mac with casking. With the added help, Apple Family cider production begins to increase:\u00a0as she\u00a0casks and stacks with her telekinesis, Twilight calculates they're\u00a0helping to make\u00a0five\u00a0barrels in the same time the Apples\u00a0were making one by themselves. Noticing the massive increase in production from the Apple Family, the Flim Flam brothers override their automatic apple quality control, and increase the power of the apple vacuum. This leads to whole trees being taken in which results in stalks, branches, rotten apples, and even rocks making their way into their cider.\nAt the end of the hour, the Flim Flam brothers have won due to their larger amount of cider produced. This makes the large audience of Ponyville residents, as well as the Apple family and honorary family members, visibly upset. But Applejack stays true to her word and tells the Flim Flam brothers that they won fair and square, and they set off to move away from Sweet Apple Acres.\n The Flim Flam brothers begin their sale of cider. They dish out their first few mugs of cider which are unfortunately laced with branches, leaves, rocks and rotten apples, and in return get it spat back at them. The angry crowd of Ponyville's residents say that they refuse to pay for the Flim Flam brothers' low quality cider, and without a second thought, the two brothers make a quick escape from Ponyville. This allows Applejack to begin selling\u00a0the family's\u00a0cider again, and because she, her friends and her family have made so many barrels, they have enough for everyone in Ponyville.\n Applejack begins to send a letter to Princess Celestia about what she had learned, but she cuts it off after saying she didn't learn anything and was right after all: \"If you take your time to do things the right way, your work will speak for itself.\" She adds that she could say she's learned that her friends will always back her up in a crisis but that she already knew that, too. Rainbow Dash attempts to get cider, but they run out again, causing her to nearly burst into tears. Pinkie Pie offers her a mug, and the Mane Six raise their mugs in cheers.\n"}, {"summary": "The episode begins with Rarity and Pinkie Pie watching something zip about in the sky. Twilight Sparkle joins them and asks what they're looking at. Pinkie\u00a0tells her that they're watching Rainbow Dash, who's performing a series of aerial stunts. Rarity and Pinkie remark how dazzling Rainbow Dash is, and the three watch her in admiration. However, something appears to go wrong, and the ponies watch in horror as Dash plummets to the ground.\n Rainbow Dash regains consciousness in a hospital bed with her friends standing around her. She finds that her right wing is bandaged and groans. Doctor Horse tells Twilight that Rainbow Dash is going to be fine, but that she will need to be in the hospital for a few days, to which Dash voices her frustration. Her friends try to cheer her up, but Dash can only sulk under the bed sheets.\nTwilight notices a nurse walking by with a cart of books and brings one, Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Stone, over to Dash. Rainbow Dash immediately and rudely tosses the book away, saying that reading is \"for eggheads\" and \"uncool\". Her friends chuckle at her view of reading, saying that everyone enjoys reading from time to time. The nurse walks in and tells the ponies that they'll have to come back tomorrow. Just before leaving, Twilight tells Rainbow Dash that she'd like Daring Do and the two of them are a lot alike.\n Following a shot of a clock on the wall showing that it's one o'clock, Rainbow Dash makes several attempts to pass the time\u2014bouncing a ball off the wall, having her lunch (getting a glass briefly stuck on her muzzle), turning her bedside lamp on and off, and telling jokes to her silent and immobile roommate. A bored-looking Rainbow Dash glances up to the clock and groans loudly as it turns to one minute past one.\nRainbow Dash looks to the book on her nightstand. She refuses to pick it up at first, but after a couple more reluctant peeks, she sighs in surrender and picks it up to start reading. As she reads, Dash finds herself instantly identifying with the main character, who also has an injured wing.\n Rainbow Dash continues reading the book aloud, and the scene fades to the events told within, where Daring Do, a brown-coated, grey-maned Pegasus with the same mane style as Rainbow Dash herself, makes her way through a tropical jungle and finds herself surrounded by a tiger, a black panther, a lynx, a cheetah, and a white house cat. Daring flees from the wildcats and uses a vine to swing across a chasm. Rainbow Dash's narration returns, and she reads that Daring Do finds herself in front of the ancient temple that she'd been seeking.\nThe scene cuts back to Rainbow Dash, who comes to grips with the fact that she loves the book (and reading) and that she is now an egghead.\n Following another passage of the book, in which Daring Do braves the ancient temple's numerous traps and pitfalls, a knock at the door interrupts Rainbow Dash. She quickly hides the book under the covers as Twilight and Fluttershy enter the room. They come to help Rainbow Dash with her boredom with a Battleship-style game, which Dash purposely loses and quickly puts away. Before the two can question Dash's odd behavior, she chases them out with the pretense of trying to sleep. When they leave, Dash retrieves the book and continues reading.\nDaring Do makes her way past more obstacles and comes to the Sapphire Stone. After briefly surveying the area around it, she picks it up and tucks it under her hat. This sets off a trap that causes the chamber to start collapsing and filling with lava. Daring Do jumps from the collapsing pillars and escapes the chamber through a skylight, but a gust of air from the chamber blasts her clear into the jungle, where she falls right at the feet of a strange dog-like creature. The creature cheerfully says \"hello, Rainbow Dash\" with Pinkie Pie's voice, and the story shifts back to Rainbow Dash's hospital room.\n Pinkie Pie, Applejack, and Rarity enter the room and inquire about Dash's well being. Nurse Snowheart then enters with Dash's dinner, which Dash eats messily, and her friends bid an awkward goodbye and leave the room in disgust. Rainbow Dash spits out the food and picks up the book again.\nThe dog-like creature named Ahuizotl captures Daring Do and ties her to a stone table in another booby-trapped room, then sets off the traps and leaves. Spiked walls start closing in, spiders crawl over the spikes, cobras emerge from the mouth of an ornament on the wall, and quicksand starts filling the room. The story is once again interrupted, this time by Doctor Horse\u2014who informs her that she's to be discharged from the hospital, and the nurses hastily wheel her out the front door before she can finish the book.\n Rainbow Dash despairs that she'll never find out what happens to Daring Do. She remembers that Twilight has a copy of the book, but after having called her an egghead, she despairs even more. Rainbow Dash attempts to admit herself into the hospital again by faking an injury. Doctor Horse doesn't fall for the ruse, however, so Rainbow Dash sneaks into the hospital at night.\nRainbow Dash returns to the room she was staying in and sees a new patient occupying the bed. Underneath the bed, she finds the book. She continues reading immediately, but she ends up waking the patient and alerting the hospital staff. As Rainbow Dash makes her getaway, her wing cramps up mid-flight and she crashes, causing her to lose the book. Before she can recover it, the hospital staff chase her out of the hospital and through Ponyville.\n The noisy pursuit wakes Rainbow Dash's friends from their sleep, and all parties meet in front of the Golden Oak Library. When asked what's going on, Dash admits to being an egghead and explains that she liked the book Twilight gave her, and she tried stealing it from the hospital so she could finish reading it. Understanding of her plight, Dash's friends tell her she didn't need to make a ruckus\u2014or, as Pinkie puts it, a fracas\u2014over a book.\nTwilight lets Rainbow Dash borrow her copy of the book, and Rainbow apologizes for everything that's happened. Twilight explains that reading is something everyone can enjoy if they give it a try, and Rainbow Dash learns not to knock something until she's tried it.\n The scene shifts back to the Daring Do story. Overcome by the quicksand, Daring Do flings her hat off of her hoof; it bounces off the walls and ceiling before hitting the trap lever to its original position. The walls and the quicksand recede, and a door opens leading outside. The scene cuts to Ahuizotl petting the white house-cat and gloating over his victory. Suddenly, Daring Do swings down from a vine and snatches the Sapphire Statue right out of his hand. As Ahuizotl weeps over his defeat, Daring Do gallops off.\nRainbow Dash finishes reading the book in her bedroom and delightedly picks up another book, Daring Do and the Griffon's Goblet.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode opens with the Cutie Mark Crusaders creating an enormous Hearts and Hooves Day card for Cheerilee. When they show it to Cheerilee, she thanks them but mentions that she doesn't have a special somepony. Therefore, the Crusaders take action to find her one. In The Perfect Stallion, the Crusaders look\u00a0for the ideal stallion for their teacher, but their initial candidates are either unsuitable or already have special someponies. When they spot Big McIntosh piling haystacks, they eagerly ask if he has plans for Hearts and Hooves Day, and when he answers no, they decide he and Cheerilee are right for each other. Sweetie Belle suggests that since Big Mac is so shy, it will be up to Cheerilee to ask him. The Crusaders set up a romantic picnic, and lure Cheerilee there by asking her to identify a tree near the gazebo. Big McIntosh arrives with a toolbox to fix the gazebo, but the three fillies have already fixed it. The fillies quickly hide in a bush to spy on the couple as they awkwardly chat. They are excited when Cheerilee appears to be leaning in for a kiss, but she matter-of-factly points out that Big Mac has something stuck in his teeth.\u00a0\n Dejected that they were unable to help Cheerilee and McIntosh get together, the Crusaders bump into Twilight Sparkle, who is reading a book about Hearts and Hooves Day. According to the book, the tradition started because of a love potion. The interested Cutie Mark Crusaders ask to borrow the book, and Twilight lends it to them. She tries to bestow another book, but the excited fillies have already left. The Cutie Mark Crusaders immediately rush to their clubhouse to create the love potion using \"a tuft of cloud\" and \"a bright rainbow's glow.\" The book then instructs to stir the mixture with a Pegasus feather. The potions turns bright pink and emits heart-shaped bubbles.\nLater that day, they bring Cheerilee and Big Mac together once more to test the potion, telling them it is punch they made. While they hide in the bushes, Cheerilee finally realizes the fillies' plan to bring them together and tells Big Mac to play along and try the \"punch.\" They drink it and the potion quickly takes effect. Cheerilee asks the stallion to be her \"very special somepony,\" and he accepts. The girls are thrilled until they hear the couple calling each other pet names, such as \"shmoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony pie\" and \"cutie-patootie lovie-dovie honey-bunny.\" Disgusted by this strange level of love, the Crusaders wonder what's gone wrong.\n Back in their clubhouse, Sweetie Belle consults the book again and finds out that the love potion is actually a love poison. The book states that a long time ago, an Earth pony prince had given an Alicorn princess the drink, intending to make her fall in love with him. However, they were so lost in each other's eyes, they were unable to perform their duties, and their kingdom fell into ruin. Apple Bloom panics, believing she and her friends may have inadvertently doomed Ponyville. Fortunately, the book also provides a way to break the love poison spell: the lovestruck ponies must be kept from looking into each other's eyes for an hour. The Crusaders go to Sugarcube Corner, where Cheerilee and Big Mac are lovingly sharing a milkshake. Mrs. Cake mentions that two ponies so clearly in love will probably want to plan a wedding soon. Sweetie Belle decides that if they can keep the two love-struck ponies away long enough to \"get ready\" for a wedding, the spell will wear off. The Crusaders suggest a wedding to Cheerilee and Big Mac, who are excited by the prospect and rush off to prepare for one.\n Sweetie Belle helps Cheerilee select a wedding dress at Carousel Boutique while barricading the dressing room to keep her inside. At the jewelry shop, Apple Bloom helps Big Mac select a diamond ring, as Scootaloo keeps track of how much time remains until the spell is broken. When Apple Bloom is talking to Scootaloo, Big Mac quickly purchases a diamond for Cheerilee and hurries to Carousel Boutique. Apple Bloom asks Scootaloo to hurry and warn Sweetie Belle, while she attempts to slow down Big Mac. However, the determined stallion is too strong to be stopped. Being weighed down by oxen and a cart full of anvils fails to stop him, and even being tethered to a house only slows him down. As Big Mac approaches the boutique, he falls into a large pit in the ground dug by Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo and lands on a mattress at the bottom. At the same time, Cheerilee bursts out of the barricaded boutique and runs towards her love. The town clock rings the hour mark just as Cheerilee jumps in, and the spell is broken. Cheerilee has no idea why she looks like she is about to get married at the bottom of a pit, and Big Mac returns to his normal, taciturn self. The Crusaders explain that it was all because of their selfish motives to make them fall in love with each other, and they apologize for the ordeal.\nCheerilee and Big Mac decide that a fair punishment would be for the fillies to do all of Big Mac's chores. With the free time that Big Mac now has, he and Cheerilee decide to have lunch together at the gazebo, calling each other\u00a0\"sugar bear\" and\u00a0\"pumpkin pie\"\u00a0and teasingly winking at each other behind the fillies' backs. The Crusaders are comically horrified by the thought that they're still under the effects of the love potion.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode opens at Sugarcube Corner. Pinkie Pie turns on exercise music, dons a workout outfit, and proceeds to exercise while making silly faces. As she pauses for a moment, it is revealed she is entertaining Pound and Pumpkin Cake, who are unimpressed by her antics. Taking a breath after her failed attempt, she accidentally sits on a set of jacks. Leaping into the air in pain, she gets caught in the ceiling fan and thrown into a pile of stuffed toys, causing the babies to giggle at her misfortune. Finally achieving her goal, she pumps her hooves in the air and declares, \"Nailed it!\"\n Later, Pinkie trots through Ponyville: she compliments Rose on her\u00a0Calla lilies (though they are actually true lilies) and Mr. Waddle on his bow tie; she wishes a happy birthday to Cheerilee, a happy day-after-birthday to Zecora, and a happy birthday 132 days in advance to a donkey named Matilda, who is amazed that Pinkie can remember everything about everyone living in Ponyville. Pinkie explains that everyone is her friend, and above all, she loves to make her friends smile, leading into the Smile Song. Pinkie amasses a large crowd parading through Ponyville, ending face to face with a grumpy-looking donkey hauling a large wagon.\n Upon seeing the donkey, she introduces herself and asks his name. After several guesses from Pinkie, the donkey reluctantly reveals that his name is Cranky Doodle Donkey. Pinkie sings about his name to the tune of the song. When Pinkie refers to him as Doodle, he angrily tells her never to use the name and continues ignoring her. A confused Pinkie, bemused by being rejected for the first time, shows her logic progression through a scene animated by stop-motion and felt cutouts. However, she resolves to befriend him by any means necessary. As Pinkie tries to strike up a conversation, Cranky reveals that he has moved to Ponyville to be alone with his memories. Pinkie proceeds to look through all his things in his wagon, annoying the donkey even further.\n Having been denied Cranky's wagon, Pinkie brings out an actual welcome wagon. Cranky reluctantly lets her get on with her greeting. One brief song later, both of them end up covered in cake batter due to Pinkie mixing up the oven with the confetti cannon. The confetti knocks Cranky's toupee off, which lands on Pinkie. She immediately mistakes it for a spider and tramples it, further annoying Cranky. Seeking to fix her mistake, Pinkie climbs a flagpole and loudly begs everyone in the vicinity for a toupee, proclaiming Cranky's baldness and infuriating him even further. Saddened by his discontent, Pinkie drags him to a spa, and tops off the treatment with a gift: a new toupee designed by Rarity, which resembles the sea serpent's hairstyle from Friendship is Magic, Part 2 as well as the hair of Johnny Bravo. He thanks her for it, but fails to bust out a smile.\n Later that day, as Cranky is busy unpacking his things at his new house, Pinkie drops by to see him and plays with a snow globe with a miniature Derpy inside. As they talk, Pinkie learns that Cranky has traveled all over Equestria, including Fillydelphia and Manehattan, looking for a 'special friend' whom Cranky lets slip to be a lady. Pinkie then discovers a scrapbook and flips through it, finding something that catches her eye. As she tries to ask Cranky about it, a series of mishaps sets the book on fire. She attempts to douse the flames, ruining the pages. Cranky is furious at Pinkie for ruining his scrapbook and throws her out, telling her that he will never be her friend.\nAfter Cranky's rejection leaves Pinkie feeling dejected and sad, she goes to Twilight for some advice. Twilight and Rainbow Dash, who is reading a Daring Do book, explain that she just has to accept that Cranky wants to be left alone. Pinkie agrees and decides to leave him alone, but only after he accepts her apology. As she tries to apologize, Cranky flees her. She chases him around town trying everything to get him to accept her apology, but he refuses, saying that nothing she can do can replace the book, which was his only reminder of 'her'.\n As Pinkie leaves in defeat, she is suddenly struck with an idea. Speaking through the door, Pinkie tells Cranky that there is still one more thing she wants to give him. He turns her down stubbornly, but after hearing a different voice in reply, he opens the door to see Matilda, the donkey Pinkie had greeted previously who turned out to be the special friend Cranky had been looking for. Pinkie explains that she figured it out from the items in Cranky's scrapbook: a flower, a ticket, and a menu from the Grand Galloping Gala, items she had also seen in a scrapbook owned by Matilda. Cranky reveals the story of meeting Matilda at the Gala. According to his story, he discovered that Matilda had disappeared when he entered her room the next day, and leaves without reading the note that Matilda had left behind. He then spent his life searching for her, and came to Ponyville to retire from his search. Matilda tells him that she has been living in Ponyville the whole time. They reunite and Matilda kisses him on the nose, causing Cranky to smile for the first time in years. Cranky gladly accepts Pinkie's apology and finally accepts her friendship. Pinkie literally turns into a rocket and explodes with joy, bouncing about rambling about everything she and Cranky can do together as friends. She calms down as Cranky tells her that he and Matilda just want some time to be together, but he assures Pinkie that the two of them are indeed friends.\n As Pinkie leaves, she muses on her letter to Princess Celestia: While some friends may enjoy playing and laughing together, some may just like to be left alone, which is fine too. Whatever the case, one of the best things about friendship is being able to make one's friends smile. The episode ends with Pinkie singing Cranky Doodle Joy, interrupting Cranky and Matilda in front of an open window of Cranky's house. The credits play a piano arrangement of Yankee Doodle, making A Friend in Deed the second episode not to feature the instrumental arrangement of the show's theme song in its credits, the first being The Return of Harmony Part 2.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode opens with Fluttershy feeding her multitude of animals. All of the pets eat eagerly except for Angel, who refuses anything Fluttershy attempts to serve him. When Fluttershy asks him what he will eat, he presents her with a recipe for an elaborate cherry-topped salad. She protests, but Angel slaps her and shoves the recipe in her face, and she yields.\nIn the Ponyville market, Fluttershy tries to buy asparagus from a stall, but other ponies cut in front of her. Meek as she is, Fluttershy is unable to assert herself. Pinkie Pie and Rarity see her predicament and try to teach her how to stand up for herself. Rarity uses her charm and sweet talk to buy the last bundle of asparagus from Gizmo, and Pinkie Pie tricks a tomato stall owner into selling her tomatoes at half the asked price.\n Fluttershy attempts to use these methods to buy the last cherry in the market, but it backfires on her, and she ends up losing the cherry to Lemon Hearts.\nFluttershy returns to her cottage and serves the salad to Angel, apologizing for the lack of the cherry on top. Upset by this, Angel tosses both the salad and Fluttershy out the door, causing Fluttershy to crash head-first into her postbox. As she laments her being \"a doormat\", she finds a pamphlet for an assertiveness seminar.\n Fluttershy arrives at the hedge maze where the seminar is being held (tossed to the back of the crowd when she tries to squeeze into the front row). The seminar begins, and a muscular Minotaur named Iron Will dramatically appears on stage to greet the crowd of ponies. He promises that anyone who follows his advice and techniques will no longer be a pushover, even providing a 100% satisfaction guarantee \u2013 anyone who isn't fully satisfied with his training will pay nothing for the seminar. Iron Will calls for a volunteer to demonstrate his methods, and his goat assistants pick out Fluttershy.\nWhen Fluttershy timidly walks on stage, one of the goat assistants deliberately blocks her path, at which point Iron Will delivers his first lessons (in rhyme form). Fluttershy hesitantly takes these lessons to heart and gives it a try; Iron Will is impressed and pleased, anticipating a big payday. He announces to the crowd that if his techniques can work for a shy pony like Fluttershy, then they can work for anyone. Fluttershy hears the audience cheering and smiles.\nAt her cottage, Fluttershy is ready to \"attack the day\" with a new, confident attitude. The advice given to her by Iron Will helps her stand up to Mr. Greenhooves when he over-waters her plants and Cherry Berry and Sweetie Drops when they block her path with garbage carts.\n She even asserts herself when she's yet again cut in line at Sugarcube Corner, scaring Shoeshine and a handful of other ponies into moving behind her. Rarity and Pinkie Pie remark how impressed they are with \"new Fluttershy\". However, when Pinkie Pie makes a joke and starts laughing, Fluttershy takes the laughter as an insult and spills punch on her before happily leaving the bakery. She then hails a taxi, but Royal Riff hops into it before her. She promptly attacks and throws him from the cart, leaving a thoroughly worried Rarity and Pinkie Pie behind.\n Fluttershy leaves her cottage once more with more confidence than ever. Realizing the wrong mail has been left in her postbox, she confronts the mailpony and disregards his apologies, citing Iron Will's lessons again. Moments later, the tourist Globe Trotter asks her for directions to the Ponyville Tower. As she responds, she ends up dropping her mail in a puddle. Fluttershy explodes in anger and throws Globe Trotter across the field and into a bale of hay.\nRarity and Pinkie Pie confront Fluttershy, worried about her recent behavior. Taking their concern as an affront, Fluttershy belittles and insults the two \u2013 Pinkie for her \"simple little brain\" and Rarity's pettiness \u2013 causing them to run away in tears. When Fluttershy calms down and sees her reflection in a puddle. Realizing how violent and unkind she's been acting, she breaks down, remorseful.\nSome time later, Rarity and Pinkie Pie come to Fluttershy's cottage and find the doors and windows boarded up. They knock on the door and call out to Fluttershy, but Fluttershy tells them to go away before she hurts them again. Inside, as Angel ties her to a chair, Fluttershy vows to never come out of her house again to avoid causing any more misery to her friends. Pinkie Pie and Rarity try to talk to her, placing blame for her actions on Iron Will's advice, and tell her she can stand up for herself without being mean, but Fluttershy thinks she's gone too far with her assertiveness.\n Before they can talk further, Iron Will arrives to collect payment from Fluttershy after hearing news of her transformation. Rarity and Pinkie Pie attempt to charm and trick him into leaving, using the same methods they demonstrated in the marketplace, but Iron Will won't be turned away. When he knocks at Fluttershy's door and she answers, he demands his payment, but she flatly and calmly refuses, surprising Rarity and Pinkie Pie. This angers the Minotaur, but Fluttershy reminds him of his 100% satisfaction guarantee; informing him that she isn't satisfied because his teachings caused her to be mean to everypony and drive her friends away, and therefore she won't pay. Surprised by this, Iron Will tries to cut her a deal, but she firmly declines, saying \"no means no\". Unable to persuade her at all, and proving to be a minotaur of his word, Iron Will honors his agreement and leaves, remarking that he may use \"no means no\" in his next seminar.\nRarity and Pinkie Pie congratulate Fluttershy for standing up to Iron Will. The three friends reconcile and hug, happy that \"old Fluttershy\" has returned and that \"new Fluttershy\" is no more.\n In her letter to Princess Celestia, Fluttershy explains that she's learned it's possible to stand up for yourself without changing who you are. When she feeds her pets, she's finally able to get the spoiled Angel to eat a regular salad, with a little help from 'The Stare'."}, {"summary": "The episode begins with Spike in a dream sequence where he is showing Rarity around a mysterious land of ice cream. He shows her his house, made of ice cream and \"extra chocolate fudge\". He then wakes up at 3 AM and sees Twilight Sparkle pacing downstairs in the Golden Oak Library lobby, worrying about herself running out of time in this month's schedule to make a new schedule.\n Twilight remains awake writing out her schedule until dawn. As she finishes, a bright light appears on the other side of the lobby. Another Twilight appears out of the bright light, with a messy mane, tattered black suit with an eyepatch and bandage, and a scar on her face. Twilight is initially shocked, since meeting another her is \"not scientifically possible.\" The other Twilight explains that she is from the future. Present Twilight asks how she figured out how to time travel, to which she responds by stating that the spell is in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing of the Canterlot Castle. Unfortunately, due to Twilight's intense curiosity about time travel, Future Twilight is unable to get a word in edgewise and doesn't have enough time to warn her of what will happen \"next Tuesday\", which is when she is from. She vanishes back into the future just mere seconds before she is able to convey her warning. The present Twilight assumes that because Future Twilight looked as bad as she did, she was going to warn Twilight about some kind of horrible disaster and determines that she has to find out what it is and prevent it.\n The next scene shows Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy carrying party goods through Ponyville. Pinkie is floating with a bunch of balloons, whereas Fluttershy is carrying everything else on her back. Twilight slams into Fluttershy as she runs through Ponyville to warn everyone of an incident she believes will happen next Tuesday. Wearing a Groucho Marx disguise she accidentally puts on after crashing into Fluttershy, Twilight jumps onto a platform and warns a small group of Ponyville residents of the incident. They proceed to laugh at her twice - once because of her disguise, and again because of her ludicrous story that she saw herself from the future.\nTwilight's friends, however, believe her story, so Twilight thinks up a plan to try prevent the disaster. She tells the Pegasi to search all over Equestria looking for potential disasters, and they do so. She instructs the remainder of Ponyville's residents to \"disaster-proof Equestria\". Twilight oversees the entire operation, checking off items on her list as they are completed, including maintaining the dam,\u00a0filling in wall cracks inside\u00a0the library,\u00a0topping off\u00a0a water tower, reinforcing a bridge, and giving Pinkie Pie a haircut.\n Suddenly, Cerberus arrives from Tartarus out of nowhere and scares everyone but Spike and Twilight away. Twilight assumes that this was the disaster Future Twilight wanted to warn her about and prepares to stop Cerberus. Before she can do so, however, Fluttershy intervenes and soothes Cerberus by rubbing its belly. On being asked by Twilight for a ball, Pinkie Pie\u00a0pulls one out of a tree knot, stating that she stocks balls all over Ponyville in case of a \"ball emergency\". She gives it to Twilight, who then uses it to lure Cerberus back to Tartarus. When Twilight returns the next morning, she's covered in soot. Spike suddenly belches a \"lost dog\" poster, noting that Princess Celestia hadn't heard about Cerberus being returned. However, the scroll hits Twilight in the face and gives her a paper cut on her cheek. When she sees this cut in the mirror, she notices that it's exactly the same cut on Future Twilight's cheek, and realizes that her efforts to \"disaster-proof\" everything have not worked.\n Twilight continues to pace around the lobby, gouging a deep, circular groove in the floor in the process. She reasons that if she stays still, nothing could possibly happen to her, and thus the disaster will not happen. Spike begins to take advantage of Twilight standing still by taking tubs of ice cream and eating them, deciding that the resultant stomach ache will be his future self's problem. Then, Rainbow Dash enters, stating that a Pegasus just came back from \"Baltimare\" with an all-clear. She asks why Twilight isn't stopping Spike from gorging himself on ice cream, to which Spike replies that she won't because she is standing still until next Tuesday. They both begin laughing at Twilight, and Spike begins tickling her with a feather. This culminates in Twilight using magic to catapult Spike away, which in turn results in Spike being flung into a wall and belching up a fireball which hits Twilight. The flame messes up Twilight's mane, causing it to look exactly like Future Twilight's mane. Twilight concludes that not doing anything has not changed the future either and laments her inability to predict the future and stop the disaster that way.\nSpike tells Twilight he knows someone who can help. He then brings Twilight to \"Madame Pinkie's place.\" Pinkie has taken up the role of a fortune teller, and begins searching in her crystal ball for Twilight's future. She prophecies that Twilight will receive \"a really cool birthday present next year\". Dissatisfied by this, Twilight begs Pinkie to use her Pinkie Sense to predict what will happen. She says she is unable to do this, stating that her Pinkie sense only predicts immediate, inconsequential events. This is proven by a sudden tail-twitch, resulting in a flowerpot landing on Twilight's head. Pinkie finds it interesting that the pot just came out of nowhere.\n In the next scene, Pinkie Pie arrives at the library, and inside she finds Twilight (now with a bandage on her head just like Future Twilight's bandage,\u00a0due to the flowerpot incident) manning a variety of telescopes, machines and graphs, performing various calculations. Twilight has decided that since doing things, not doing things, and trying to predict the future have not done anything to prevent the disaster, her only choice left is to \"monitor everything.\" She uses one of her telescopes to look into the sky, but accidentally aims it at the sun, hurting her eye. Pinkie Pie whips out an eyepatch from the fireplace, stating that she stocks eyepatches all over Ponyville in case of \"an eyepatch emergency\" and puts it on her. With the eyepatch, Twilight looks even more like Future Twilight, and realizes that she has done nothing to stop the catastrophe. Twilight resolves that she only has one option left to stop the disaster: stop time.\n Twilight, Pinkie Pie and Spike arrive at Canterlot by train to search for a spell to stop time. After avoiding a guard by pretending to be statues, Spike asks Twilight why they need to wear the black bodysuits, and Twilight tells the other two that the time spells are kept in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing of the archives, which is the most secure. They head off, but Twilight rips her suit on a bush, resulting in her looking just like Future Twilight. They enter the archives and begin to sneak around the guards in order to make their way undetected to the Star Swirl the Bearded wing. They end up going around in a circle and ending up where they started. A guard catches the trio, but recognizes Twilight and opens the door to the wing for her.\nOnce inside the wing, the trio begin searching frantically for the right spell. Unfortunately, they don't find the spell in time, and the sun rises. Twilight ducks under a windowsill, believing that the disaster is about to occur, but nothing happens. Princess Celestia comes across Twilight, but just bids her a happy Tuesday and walks off. Twilight then realizes that there may have not been a disaster after all, and she was just making herself frantic over nothing. She doesn't know what Future Twilight was trying to tell her, but she does realize that she looks ridiculous in her current state.\n While she could not find a spell to stop time, Pinkie finds a spell that allows the caster to go back in time once for a short period. Twilight decides to use the spell to warn her past self not to worry about a disaster that isn't going to happen, and exactly the same sequence plays out that happened earlier when Twilight was first met by Future Twilight. After returning, having not being able to warn Past Twilight, she realizes that she was trying to warn herself to not worry, only to be foiled by her past self's fascination of time travel. Thus, she has ensured that the events she was trying to prevent will actually happen. Pinkie reassures her that it's \"Past Twilight's\" problem now. The episode ends as Twilight puts Spike, now experiencing a stomach ache after his ice cream binge, on her back and returning home.\n"}, {"summary": "The episode begins with Applejack and Pinkie Pie rapidly digging a hole in the ground. Next, Rainbow Dash is shown dragging Fluttershy to the door of her cottage, with her and Twilight Sparkle urging her to go to the \"once in a generation\" dragon migration. Fluttershy is clearly afraid to go, drawing back to her fear of dragons in Dragonshy. Rainbow Dash says that Fluttershy owes her for the time she spent with her at the butterfly migration, but she resists by hanging on to her front door frame. Eventually losing her temper with a cry of \"NO!!!\", she steamrolls over Rainbow Dash with a hoof to the stomach, and gently opens\u00a0one of her living room windows to exit through with a jump and runs off, much to Twilight's horror. Rainbow, still lying on the floor, decides to let her off the hook this time.\nTwilight, Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rainbow Dash are then shown in the finished hole, which turns out to be a viewing trench behind some low-lying bushes, wearing camouflage to try and spot dragons. Rarity finally arrives, wearing a swanky pink, purple and gold camouflage naming herself the \"toast of the trench\", and arriving on a red carpet. They then spot the dragons flying above, and a few of them begin to fight with each other. One of them breathes fire in Rainbow Dash's direction, charring her coat. Spike is also present, and begins handing out snacks to his friends. But Rainbow Dash makes fun about how he isn't like the other dragons. Rarity rushes to back up Spike from Rainbow Dash's insults, but Spike still ends up storming off, upset.\n Spike is up late at night wondering what he is and where he is from. Twilight can\u2019t sleep over Spike talking and tells him she doesn\u2019t know since he was given to her as an egg and she doesn\u2019t know who found him or where. Spike says that doesn\u2019t give him the answers he needs so Twilight suggests some late night research. Spike is surprised and Twilight is confident they will find something.\nThe next morning, neither Twilight nor Spike has found any information on dragons. Twilight says they are apparently too rare and scary for ponies to talk to or study. Spike wonders if dragons cry and Twilight wipes his face, as he starts to cry. Spike pushes her tissue away and says he will discover who he is if it is that last thing he does. Rainbow Dash and Rarity come in and invite Spike and Twilight to breakfast. Twilight agrees but Spike opts out and says he wants to get an early start. Rarity asks him what he means and Spike says he is going on a quest of self-discovery to learn what it means to be a dragon. Spike says that only way to do that is to join the Dragon Migration. Twilight, Rainbow and Rarity are shocked at this. As Spike sets off, they mutter to each other that they will follow him.\n Spike sets out on his journey, which takes him across mountains, rivers and forests. Finally, he arrives in the volcanic area that the dragons have migrated to. Spike notices a group of teenage dragons and runs down to them. Unfortunately, he is almost immediately berated by the other dragons, who make fun of his small size and lack of wings. They also accuse him of being \"part pony\", or a \"pony in a dragon costume\"; which is ironic, seeing as Rarity, Twilight, and Rainbow Dash are nearby in a dragon costume, having followed Spike to the crater.\nSpike is challenged to a series of games. The first challenge is a burping contest, which Spike performs poorly in due to only being able to come up with a small burst of magical fire, from which a scroll from Princess Celestia appears. The scroll is tossed into a lava pool by one of the dragons. The next challenge is a tail-wresting competition. Spike first wrestles with the three ponies dressed up as a dragon, and he struggles at this even when the three ponies are not putting up any fight. The costumed ponies collapse on purpose though, to make it look as if Spike won. However, Spike is then put up against a dragon with a giant tail, who catapults him into the side of the crater. The third challenge is dubbed \"king of the hoard\", a play on the game \"king of the hill\". Spike sneakily climbs up the hill of gems, and softly nudges off the dragon on top. While celebrating, Spike loses his balance and falls down the mound of gems. The final challenge is to find out who could make the largest splash by cannonballing into a pool of lava. Although nervous about the dizzying height, Spike screws up his courage and jumps off the ledge, but lands face down in a painful belly flop and slowly sinks into the lava as the teenagers wince.\n Spike assumes he did poorly. However, one of the teenage dragons, Garble, astounded by Spike's ability\u00a0to withstand the fall, announces that Spike will be crowned as a dragon, and after being given a noogie in the initiation ceremony, is\u00a0initiated as a dragon. The dragons then hold a party in which they gorge themselves on gems, after which Spike mentions that he doesn't want to leave the group.\n The group of dragons then decide to go on a phoenix egg raid. Spike reluctantly agrees to go, and after saying that he'll just wait behind as he can't fly, is picked up by another dragon and flown to the nest. The dragons observe the two adult phoenixes, and tell Spike to lure them away. Spike pelts the nest with a rock, which prompts the phoenixes to fly after him, leaving their eggs unguarded. When the other dragons move in to steal the eggs, they find that they have hatched into baby phoenixes. The baby phoenixes fly around and disorientate the dragons, and then call for help from their parents. The parents fly back to help their babies, and successfully evade the pursuing dragons using magic.\n By the time they return to Spike, they find he has found an unhatched phoenix egg. They egg on Spike to smash the egg on the ground, but he refuses to do so. At this point, Twilight, Rarity and Rainbow Dash show up, and doff their dragon costume. They assert themselves towards the dragons, only to make them laugh. The four then decide to simply run away, and Twilight teleports them away as the dragons gain on them, causing them to crash into a tree. After this, Spike tells the three ponies that they are more than just his friends, they are his family too, and they share a group hug.\nOnce back in Ponyville, Spike begins writing a letter to Princess Celestia. In this letter, he says that he has learned that \"who I am is not the same as what I am\". He says that although he was born a dragon, his pony friends have taught him how to be \"kind, loyal and true\", and that he is proud to call them his family. Then, the phoenix egg, which Spike kept, suddenly hatches, and Spike names the baby phoenix Peewee.\n"}, {"summary": "\nThe episode begins with Rainbow Dash flying through Ponyville while giving out flyers for a mandatory meeting she's holding for all Ponyville Pegasi. Later on in the evening, Pegasus ponies gather at the Golden Oak Library. Fluttershy waits outside disguised as a tree, but after a quick headcount, Rainbow Dash sees through it and pushes her inside.\n Inside the library, Rainbow Dash shows the group of Pegasus ponies a cartoon film that explains how Cloudsdale requires rainwater to produce the rainclouds for Equestria. In order to obtain this water, Pegasus ponies must work together to make a tornado to funnel water up to Cloudsdale from a reservoir on the ground. The wind speed that a Pegasus can fly is measured in \"wing power,\" and the minimum wind speed required for water to overcome gravity is 800 wing power. The film reel is then damaged in the projector that Spike is working, so Rainbow Dash takes over. She explains how this year, Cloudsdale has chosen Ponyville's highland reservoir, and that Spitfire, captain of The Wonderbolts, will be present to oversee the water transfer and take the official record of their top wind speed. She also says that the year before, Fillydelphia made a new wind speed record of 910 wing power, but believes that if they train hard, Ponyville could do better and put out a wind speed power of over 1,000. The other Pegasi react every time she speaks with great enthusiasm, but as they end the meeting with cheers, Rainbow notices that Fluttershy has vanished from where she was standing.\n After this, Rainbow Dash appears on a training field in the daytime where a multitude of Pegasus ponies are training for tornado duty, giving out encouragement and pointers where needed. Rainbow notes that every Pegasus resident is present except for Fluttershy. Rainbow goes to Fluttershy's cottage, finding her in a robe with red spots all over her. Fluttershy gives out a few fake coughs and sneezes and tries to claim that she \"really, really wanted to come to training\" but ended up with pony pox. Rainbow does not fall for this ruse and sympathetically says that there's only one cure for pony pox... and then dumps a bucket of cold water onto Fluttershy, rinsing the \"pony pox\" away. Next, Fluttershy falls over and says that she hurt her wing and cannot fly, but Rainbow Dash once again proves otherwise as she startles her with her coach's whistle, prompting her to fly into the air. Rainbow gently persuades her foalhood friend to tell her what's going on and Fluttershy finally cracks, expressing to Rainbow Dash her inability to fly in performances in front of others, which she believes tornado duty to be. She then recollects her experiences at flight camp when\u00a0the two of them\u00a0were younger, where her inability to fly properly led the other fillies and colts to laugh at her. Although Rainbow at first snaps at her and says, \"Suck it up, Fluttershy!\", she calms down and tells Fluttershy that she will need every Pegasus' help and every ounce of wing power she can get to break the record, including Fluttershy. Fluttershy refuses until, after Rainbow starts flying away sadly, she finally obliges to help.\nBack at the training field, Twilight Sparkle and Spike are present and aid Rainbow Dash by measuring the wing power of each Pegasus, recording the results, and keeping the project organized and on track. Twilight attempts to explain how a machine she has, an anemometer with a wing power gauge, measures the power, but after no one understands her scientific terms, Spike explains in simple English. Twilight then hears someone in the crowd cough; she suspects that it is Thunderlane, who earlier in the meeting had also been coughing. Twilight sprays him with a disinfectant spray, although the one who coughed was actually Blossomforth, who is standing behind him, while Rainbow Dash comments that he's trying to pull a ruse to get out of tornado duty. Rainbow starts off by setting Thunderlane around the track to measure his wing power and he gets a rating of 9.3 wing power. Then, Rainbow Dash herself has her wing power measured, and she gets a rating of 16.5 wing power.\n Rainbow Dash states that if each and every Pegasus can get their wing power above 10 by the end of the week, they will be able to set the new tornado speed record. After measuring some more Pegasus ponies' wing power, it is Fluttershy's turn. As she slowly makes her way around the track, Flitter and Cloudchaser begin to laugh, reminding her of being bullied at flight camp, which hinders her performance further. In the end, she obtains a wing power rating of 0.5; Twilight and Rainbow try to spin this in a positive light, but this is ruined when Spike ponders the fact that this is actually less than 1 wing power, which earns him a smack upside the head from Twilight. Reminded of her bullying, Fluttershy's confidence is crushed. Rainbow Dash asks her not to leave, but it is to no avail: Fluttershy bursts into tears and runs away, saying she does not have the courage to partake in the tornado.\n Fluttershy is then shown crying next to a willow tree, being comforted by Angel and her various animal friends. The animals attempt to give her the confidence to partake in the event, reminding her of when she instilled confidence in them. They succeed in this when Fluttershy says she will get her confidence up and become a great flyer.\nWith the help of her animal friends, Fluttershy trains by doing wing push-ups with animals on her back, tug-of-war with a pack of butterflies, and flying past dandelions to see if she can dislodge their seeds. As she trains more, she eventually gets better and better, until she can finally do push-ups with several animals on her back, beat a large pack of butterflies in a tug-of-war, and dislodge the seeds from a whole patch of dandelions. She does all this as her animal friends use pony masks to try and imitate the crowd who will be alongside her in the actual event.\n Fluttershy arrives back at the track, surrounded by her animal friends, for a second run. She does improve her wing power rating, although it is still comparatively low at 2.3. This once again makes her upset, claiming that her nerves got the best of her. Rainbow tells her that she doesn't care if Fluttershy can't make it to 10 wing power, as every bit will count. Fluttershy asks how Rainbow would feel if it was her that could only fly at 2.5 when everypony else can do 10.0 (Spike points out it was 2.3, earning him another upside-the-head from Twilight). When Rainbow awkwardly waffles on a direct answer, Fluttershy answers that she'd feel humiliated, exactly as she does right now. On the verge of tears, she apologizes and trots away saying she just can't do it. Spike blithely tells Rainbow that she'll still have tons of wing power available to lift the water before an annoyed Twilight drags him away, but Rainbow just wishes that there was a way to lift her friend out of the dumps.\n The next day, the Pegasi gather at the highland reservoir where Twilight is in charge of a very large and robust anemometer to record the tornado's wind speed, and Spitfire arrives from Cloudsdale to oversee the transfer. As attendance is taken, it is shown that Thunderlane is not present, and his younger brother Rumble explains that he has the feather flu and is at Ponyville Hospital. Seven other ponies are also absent due to feather flu, and Rainbow Dash is worried they won't break the record - but Twilight calculates that they might not even have enough wing power to get the water up to Cloudsdale at all.\nWhen Spike asks if they should pack things up, Rainbow decides to ignore the record and just focus on getting the water to Cloudsdale. With the Pegasi ready, Twilight gives the anemometer a final check then has Spike blow on a very large and old carved wooden horn used to signal the start and the end of the tornado, and they begin to form the tornado with the Pegasus ponies who are present. As the Pegasi succeed in beginning to suck the water up the funnel, Fluttershy arrives on the scene to give Rainbow Dash moral support. However, the tornado breaks down as the ponies lose their coordination, tiring and knocking into each other. Rainbow Dash immediately gets up to try again, but Twilight holds her back, concerned that if the formation breaks apart again, somepony could get hurt. Rainbow considers this, but decides to give the tornado one more shot, as she must know if she and her crew gave it their all. Once again, Spike signals the tornado formation, and eventually, the combined power peaks at 795 wing power, just below the required 800 wing power to overcome gravity. With Spitfire only there as an observer, Fluttershy is the only Pegasus left that can help.\n After some encouragement from Twilight, Fluttershy puts on a pair of flight goggles and allows herself to be sucked into the tornado. After flailing a bit, she manages to place herself in formation. When Rainbow Dash spots her, she is delighted that Fluttershy is flying with them and together they strain alongside the other Pegasi. She surpasses her previous best wing power rating as her effort causes the meter to climb to 798, but begins to tire and is overtaken by other Pegasus ponies. This begins to remind her once again of the bullying at flight camp, but this time, it strengthens her nerves, allowing her to travel faster than previously. Fluttershy manages to peak out at five wing power, causing the tornado to reach 800.\n The water overcomes gravity and to Spitfire's surprise, suddenly explodes out the top of the tornado and is siphoned to Cloudsdale. Spike signals on the horn once more, and the Pegasi safely exit the formation. Once Fluttershy stops flying in circles, she receives much praise. Spitfire congratulates Rainbow Dash on showing \"a lot of guts,\" but Rainbow Dash directs the congratulations to Fluttershy, whom she dubs her \"number one flyer.\" A group of ponies carries her away, chanting her name, as she recites her letter to Princess Celestia, in which she mentions her realization that although sometimes you may feel that what you can offer may make only little difference, every contribution counts, and that if \"you just keep your head high, do your best, and believe in yourself, anything can happen.\""}, {"summary": "The episode opens just as school is getting out, with Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo complaining about the compliments Featherweight is receiving for his new-found cutie mark, considering they have yet to find their own. Apple Bloom states that she has found the answer to all of their problems with the school newspaper, the Foal Free Press. But just as she begins to explain, she is called away by Granny Smith. Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle decide to try out the idea, but they have completely misunderstood Apple Bloom. First, they try using the newspaper to make paper-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, bird's nests, and even sailing down the river in a newspaper boat, checking for a cutie mark on their flank with each attempt. After these feats, Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle come to Apple Bloom to tell her how bad of an idea it was. Upon getting a chance to explain, Apple Bloom tells them that she meant for them to write for the Foal Free Press. Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo fall over in defeat.\nThe Cutie Mark Crusaders stay in the schoolhouse after class, for the Foal Free Press meeting. Scootaloo and Apple Bloom find trying to get their cutie marks in journalism to be \"such a good idea.\" Miss Cheerilee goes on to start the meeting, explaining that the previous editor-in-chief graduated, and that the editor-in-chief is the one in charge of the whole paper. She also states that they have a new editor to replace the previous: Diamond Tiara. The entire class is surprised, and Diamond Tiara jumps right into the meeting. She explains that nobody takes the school paper seriously, and how she plans to \"deliver [them] to new-found glory,\" with only a single agreement from the rest of the class, and immediately begins handing out orders to the staff photographer, Featherweight. Diamond Tiara states that there will be no more \"Namby-pamby stories like last year's editor,\" referring to Namby-Pamby, the previous year's editor-in-chief. She demands that the rest of the crew go out and start reporting. Scootaloo suggests the Crusaders leave the school newspaper, only to be convinced by Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle that it can get them their cutie marks.\nSweetie Belle's first story is an interview with Rarity\u00a0while she's working on a project. But\u00a0as she\u00a0attempts to conduct the interview, her presence inspires Rarity to use her as a test model for the\u00a0outfit she's working on that features large feathers. Scootaloo's story is about a nest of newly hatched baby birds, where she falls out of a tree and is seen attempting to fly (to the birds' delight), only managing to keep her flank out of the mud. Apple Bloom's story is about the history of Ponyville, as told by Granny Smith, but she must first convince the elder Apple to not focus on albums\u00a0filled with\u00a0Apple Bloom's embarrassing baby pictures.\nThe Cutie Mark Crusaders head back to the Foal Free Press room, bringing their stories with them. Each of their stories is shot down one-by-one by Diamond Tiara, as she corners them and badgers them for better, \"juicier\" stories. The Cutie Mark Crusaders are then thrown out of the back door of the news room, where Sweetie Belle happens to stumble across Snips and Snails fighting to get gum out of their coats, only managing to get themselves stuck together. She hurriedly calls Featherweight over to snap pictures of the scene and tells him that she will meet him during lunch. Unable to contain her excitement, Sweetie Belle tells Apple Bloom and Scootaloo about their next big story.\nThe newest edition of the paper appears with the headliner \"Snips and Snails and Bubblegum Fails,\" and various readers voice interest and approval for the article. Snips and Snails express that they are proud of ending up in the newspaper and show that they got the gum out of their coats. Diamond Tiara is overjoyed at how popular the column is and requests more gossip from the Cutie Mark Crusaders. Sweetie Belle explains that they signed the column with the pseudonym \"Gabby Gums\" as a shorthand for the three of them because there was not enough room for all of their names. Diamond Tiara continues to praise them for their work on the column.\nSitting at a picnic table in the schoolyard, the Cutie Mark Crusaders find themselves unable to come up with ideas for their next column. Snips and Snails show off that they are once more stuck together with gum but are ignored.\nWalking across the floor of her boutique, Rarity trips over Sweetie Belle's discarded saddle bag. The bag falls open as she picks it up, revealing a copy of the Foal Free Press which Rarity begins reading. After Sweetie Belle walks in and catches her with her bag, Rarity pleads with Sweetie to let her show the paper to her friends. Sweetie, upon learning Rarity's interest in the Gabby Gums column, rushes out to meet with Apple Bloom and Scootaloo at the school playground, stating that they need to expand to writing stories about the residents of Ponyville. Excited, the Cutie Mark Crusaders tell Featherweight to start working overtime. Their next story is about Mr. and Mrs. Cake, introduced with a snapshot of the couple holding their crying foals while Diamond Tiara narrates the headline: \"Pound and Pumpkin Cake, Trip to the Store Ends in Tears.\" Just then, Truffle Shuffle runs in exclaiming how the Ponyville Newsstand wants to carry the Foal Free Press, and an ecstatic Diamond Tiara orders the Cutie Mark Crusaders to continue writing gossip columns. A montage is shown of the process of writing and printing the paper, as well as ponies grabbing the paper hot off the press.\nTwilight, Spike, Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity, and Pinkie are being treated at the spa, when Rainbow Dash rushes in with the Foal Free Press. Rarity insists that Rainbow sit down and have a hooficure, but Rainbow resists stubbornly, saying that the day she gets a hooficure is the day she turns in her daredevil license. Twilight explains she enjoys reading Gabby Gums too, but that she finds her a little mean. Reading the headline \"Celestia: Just Like Us,\" Twilight says Gabby Gums doesn't value anyone's privacy. The others brush it off as \"harmless gossip\" and laugh at a few of the other headlines. Twilight also explains how she feels sorry for the ponies featured in Gabby's columns, and Rainbow shoots it down as it being \"awesome\" to get your name in the paper. Rarity again insists that Rainbow should join them in getting a hooficure, which she reluctantly accepts, just as Featherweight steps into the doorway with a camera. Upon the spa pony's attempt to file Rainbow's hoof, Rainbow flies away in fear, stating that she hates ponies touching her hooves. Then she says that she \"would love it if Gabby Gums did a story on [her].\" Spike responds that Gabby Gums already did a story on himself.\n Trying to go a different route, the Cutie Mark Crusaders attempt to write about an interview with Spike. They are shot down by Diamond Tiara, and decide to go back to their \"usual gossip.\" Sweetie Belle realizes that they might be hurting other ponies with their gossip, and Apple Bloom and Scootaloo agree, saying they didn't want to say anything because everybody loved it so much. Sweetie Belle opts for giving the public what they want, that being gossip, and the others reluctantly agree.\n The next edition of the Foal Free Press features a gossip column about Applejack sleeping on the job and Big McIntosh hiding something, with a picture of Big McIntosh sitting down with Smarty Pants. There is also a column about Twilight titled \"Twilight Sparkle: I Was a Canterlot Snob,\" detailing how Spike told Gabby Gums Twilight's supposed opinion of Ponyville. Spike claims Gabby Gums made it up, and Rarity reiterates her opinion about how Gabby Gums is just a harmless newspaper columnist.\nThe next story is about Fluttershy, who slowly sinks under the table at the announcement of the headline \"Fluttershy Has Tail Extensions.\" Pinkie Pie, being outraged at first, reluctantly admits that the headline \"Pinkie Pie is an Out of Control Party Animal\" is true. The Cake family rushes in as Twilight reads the headline \"The Cakes are Breaking Up!\" Rainbow breaks through the door with a large pile of newspapers, upset about being called a \"Super Softie\" in the headlines, and wails over being a laughing stock. Rarity, still saying that the gossip is harmless and all of the other ponies are over-reacting, finally finds the headline \"The Drama Queen Diaries.\" Gabby Gums reprinted her diary, Rarity says that she will destroy her.\nTwilight suggests that they should talk to Sweetie Belle to get to the bottom of Gabby Gum's identity. Rarity defends her sister, saying that she would never associate herself with someone as \"beastly\" as Gabby Gums. Upon arriving home, she opens Sweetie Belle's saddlebag to find her diary, astonished by her sister's treacherous act. From this, Rarity concludes that Sweetie Belle is indeed Gabby Gums.\n Rarity kicks open her bedroom door and finds Sweetie Belle reading through her notepad on the floor. Sweetie Belle is surprised at Rarity finding out, and asks how, to be informed that her reprinting of her big sister's diary was her giveaway. Rarity then reiterates Twilight's point earlier on, about how gossip can be a very hurtful thing, and how it can be an invasion of privacy, just like when Rarity searched through Sweetie Belle's saddlebag. Sweetie Belle explains that they are only doing this because of how badly they want their cutie marks, and Rarity explains that making people feel horrible is not something to want as a destiny.\nThe Cutie Mark Crusaders continue to confront Diamond Tiara about quitting, and are again shot down. Diamond Tiara says she doesn't care about other ponies' feelings. The Cutie Mark Crusaders try to quit again, only to be confronted with embarrassing photos taken by Featherweight, from when they were working on their first stories, that Diamond Tiara threatens to print instead\u00a0if they don't come up with a story.\n The Cutie Mark Crusaders attempt to find a way out of the situation but ask around for stories for the moment. They first try asking Rainbow, only for her to push a raincloud over their heads. Next, they try Fluttershy, and when arriving at her house, notice a puddle leaking under the door. Angel opens the door, and Fluttershy is seen crying in the background. Angel then slams the door in their faces. They then head to Twilight's library, only to discover that a force field has been placed around it. Spike yells at the trio that Twilight had anticipated such a visit and had put the barrier up. Lastly, they try Applejack and Big Mac, who are still mad at them due to their feature in the paper. In a reversal of character, Applejack is laconic while Big Mac explains why the Crusaders should be ashamed of themselves and tells them to leave them be. As the Cutie Mark Crusaders walk through town, everyone turns their head away from them and closes their windows and shutters. They regroup at their club house, where they discuss the situation, and how Diamond Tiara will publish their blackmail pictures the next day if they do not meet their deadline. They decide that they will not leave the clubhouse until they figure out a solution.\n Just as the sun rises, and Diamond Tiara instructs to have the unopened file of\u00a0blackmail pictures printed, the Cutie Mark Crusaders run in with a Gabby Gums column. Diamond Tiara, in a hurry to get the next edition out on time, does not read the column before sending it to the press. As she exits the schoolhouse, she catches Dinky Doo reading the newest edition of the paper, and pulls it out of her hooves to read it. Astonished at the title, Diamond Tiara sets out for revenge, and\u00a0vows to print their blackmail photos the next day. The column that the Cutie Mark Crusaders submitted instead is an open letter of their apology to all of the residents of Ponyville for the pain and embarrassment that they caused, and also reveals who Gabby Gums is, being Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo, and Apple Bloom. The column explains their reasoning for writing the previous gossip columns, being that the popularity of the column made them ignore the feeling of wrongness it caused, and asks for Ponyville's forgiveness.\u00a0They\u00a0conclude it by\u00a0signing off for the last time as Gabby Gums.\n Everyone in Ponyville forgives the Cutie Mark Crusaders after reading their letter, and Cheerilee admits her mistake in that she might've given too much power to a first-time editor. Diamond Tiara is demoted to working on the printing press while \"Shady Daze\" is promoted to staff photographer, and Featherweight is instated as editor-in-chief of the Foal Free Press."}, {"summary": "The episode begins with Pinkie commenting on a large cake that Mr. and Mrs. Cake have made for the National Dessert Competition in Canterlot. Pinkie is in charge of its transport and excited about the responsibility. Applejack interrupts Pinkie, pointing out that Big McIntosh is getting exhausted from holding the cake on his back.\nPinkie puts on a hardhat with a red, flashing light, and guides Big McIntosh out the door, followed by Mr. and Mrs. Cake. Outside, the street has been blocked off so that the cake can be moved safely. As Big McIntosh falters under the weight of the cake, Mr. Cake faints out of terror. Big McIntosh manages to keep the cake upright. Pinkie calls on Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy to help him by holding the cake's tray up with ropes. After the cake nearly falls a second time, and Mr. Cake faints once again, Pinkie recruits Twilight Sparkle's help. Twilight casts a protective magic bubble around the cake. Pinkie Pie asks Applejack and Rarity to help by holding a trampoline behind the cake.\n The side panel of the train's dessert car is removed for the cake to be loaded on, and Big McIntosh hammers it back in place. Pinkie Pie thanks her friends for helping to get the cake to and aboard the train, and Twilight Sparkle thanks her for letting them accompany her to the National Dessert Competition. Rarity talks about how much fun the festivities will be, while Applejack ponders how good all the treats will taste and reaches her hoof out to the Marzipan cake, only to have her hoof smacked aside by Pinkie Pie. Pinkie then gushes about the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness\u2014or as she nicknames it, the \"MMMM\"\u2014describing its deliciousness and believing that it will win first prize.\nJust then, three other National Dessert Competition participants board the train. Gustave le Grand, a pompous griffon with a French accent, declares that his Exquisite \u00c9clairs will win first prize. Donut Joe, the unicorn stallion with a Brooklyn accent that operates Twilight and Spike's favorite donut shop in Canterlot, carts in his \"Donutopia\", a small city model made out of sprinkled donuts. Lastly arrives Mulia Mild, a mule with a large chocolate mousse moose, and brags how winning will make her the greatest chef in Equestria. The four entrants argue amongst themselves as the train starts moving. Twilight then recommends that everyone gets rest, and Gustave, Joe, and Mulia head to their compartments. The ponies head to their own compartments only to be stopped by Pinkie, who states that the group needs to guard \"MMMM\" from the other chefs and potential saboteurs. Believing that Pinkie Pie is overreacting, Twilight and the others retire to their compartments. Pinkie Pie, however, decides to spend the night guarding the \"MMMM\".\n Pinkie Pie stays awake to keep a close eye on the cake and almost falls asleep while doing so. A shadowy figure zooms behind her, and Pinkie Pie chases the figure through the train cars to the end of the train. When Pinkie reaches the caboose, she cannot find the culprit. Pinkie heads back to the dessert car and notices the shadowy figure again. She once again chases it until she reaches the engine, where she finds the shadow of the engineer shoveling coal into the firebox. Pinkie Pie returns to the dessert car to resume guarding the cake, but the shades are suddenly closed. In the dark a 'thief' hits a painting by the door while leaving the room, leaving it askew. After straightening the picture, Pinkie Pie tries to continue her vigil but falls asleep.\n Pinkie Pie wakes up and sees that the cake appears fine. Twilight Sparkle comes in the room and notices large bite marks on the three bottom tiers of the back side of the cake. Pinkie Pie screams that the cake has been half-eaten, waking up the other bakers and the rest of her friends. Pinkie dons a deerstalker hat and bubble pipe and gives Twilight a bowler hat. Pinkie declares that she knows who \"dun' did it\" and accuses Gustave of ruining the \"MMMM\". The scene cuts to a fantasy reminiscent of an old, black and white silent film. In the fantasy, Gustave is a mustachioed villain who grabs Pinkie and ties her to train tracks with an oncoming train coming towards her. The scene flashes to a conveyor belt where \"MMMM\" is placed in-front of a buzz saw which cuts the cake clean in half. Snapping back to reality, Twilight points out the flaws in Pinkie's story, mainly that Pinkie is present and not tied to train tracks and that the cake was eaten instead of cut.\nPinkie then proclaims that Donut Joe is the culprit. The scene cuts to another fantasy: a James Bond parody with Donut Joe as a spy called Con Mane. Con Mane gases Pinkie, knocking her unconscious, and uses another gas to uncover lasers guarding \"MMMM\". He uses a mirror to make the lasers cut the cake into pieces. Ending the fantasy, Twilight points out the flaws in her second story, namely that there is no laser beam security system and Donut Joe does not fit into the role of the \"sleek, stealthy Con Mane\" instead being \"big, gruff and messy\". Pinkie then blames everything on Mulia Mild.\nIn a third fantasy, Mulia Mild is a ninja on top of the train. Mild sneaks behind Pinkie and knocks her out with a frying pan. Mild pulls out a sword and slices the cake into pieces. Twilight, again, ends the fantasy by reiterating that the cake was not cut, and that Mild is too old and fidgety to be a stealthy ninja. Defeated, Pinkie gushes about how good the other chefs' desserts look. The train goes into a pitch dark tunnel and ponies start to scream. The other chefs' desserts are now also destroyed. Twilight sends everyone but Pinkie, as she was the only witness, to their cars as they perform an investigation.\n Twilight swaps hats with Pinkie Pie and the two then retrace Pinkie's steps when she was watching the cake. When they reach the caboose, Twilight finds a clue (though it is hidden from view). Retracing further, the two go to the engine where Twilight inspects the engineer's hat and finds a second clue. Back in the dessert car, Twilight discovers a third clue on the bumped painting. Everyone then meets in the dessert car and Twilight reveals the first clue: a blue feather belonging to Rainbow Dash. Twilight explains that Rainbow Dash was the first shadowy figure who zipped past her. When Pinkie reached the caboose, Rainbow Dash hovered close to the ceiling to avoid being seen.\nTwilight then reveals the second clue: a strand of pink hair that belongs to Fluttershy. The second shadowy figure was Fluttershy, who donned the driver's hat (piling her long mane into it) and neckerchief and began shoveling coal to fool Pinkie. The third clue is half a set of false eyelashes that belong to Rarity. Rarity used her magic to shut the shades and darken the room. When she left, she slammed her head into the painting, leaving one set of fake eyelashes on it; upon realizing it this morning, she adjusted her mane to hang over her right eye. Rarity then admits that she wears fake eyelashes and that she took a bite of the cake. Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash also admit they ate some of the cake.  All three only meant to take one bite, but it was so delicious that they ended up having a lot more than they were planning to. They explain that Pinkie Pie's earlier description on the cake enticed them into trying it. The three culprits apologize to Pinkie, who forgives them.\nWith the mystery of the cake solved, Twilight gives the deerstalker to Pinkie, who uses what she's learned to look for the clues to solve the mystery of who devoured the other bakers' desserts. Pinkie soon reveals that the bakers all have traces of another baker's confections on them, and deduces that they ate each other's desserts: Joe has \u00e9clair in his hair, Gustave has mousse in his mustache, and Mulia has sprinkles in her wrinkles. The bakers confess to the crimes, stating (once again) that Pinkie's earlier description of the desserts enticed each one into eating them. Equally guilty, the bakers all forgive each other. The train reaches Canterlot with all the desserts destroyed. However, Pinkie has an idea of how they can all enter with their goods.\n\nPinkie and the group head up to the competition with their newly made dessert\u2014a combination of all the bakers' confections\u2014and conclude that you mustn't accuse others of a wrongdoing without any proof, as it can hurt their feelings and make them look silly. They celebrate their success and teamwork with Princess Celestia and a piece of cake, which Pinkie turns down only to devour the rest of the entire cake, leaving her incredibly bloated before she eats the fourth wall."}, {"summary": "Spike delivers a letter from Princess Celestia to Twilight Sparkle, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Pinkie Pie, and Applejack. In the letter, Princess Celestia asks Twilight and her friends to help with the upcoming royal wedding in Canterlot. Applejack will provide catering for the reception, Pinkie Pie will host it, Fluttershy will train and conduct the bird choir, Rainbow Dash will perform a sonic rainboom during the ceremony, and Rarity will design the wedding dresses. Twilight receives the keystone job of overseeing the preparations.\nTwilight is shocked to learn that the bride and groom are \"Princess Mi Amore Cadenza\" and Twilight's brother, Shining Armor. Twilight is upset because he never told her about his wedding or Princess Mi Amore Cadenza. In a song called B.B.B.F.F. (\"Big Brother Best Friend Forever\"), Twilight recalls how she and Shining Armor used to do everything together, and how much she misses him.\nOn the train ride to Canterlot, everyone except Twilight happily discusses the wedding, and only Applejack notices Twilight's glumness. Upon inquiry, Twilight says that she is still thinking about Shining Armor's neglect of her, though Applejack tells her not to worry.\n At Canterlot, it is evident that there has been an increase in security: the train passes through a pink protective sphere encasing the city, there are many guards at the station, and Princess Celestia keeps watch with the aid of a telescope from the balcony of the highest tower. Shining Armor is happy to see his sister and affectionately calls her \"Twily.\u201d Twilight immediately berates him for not telling her about the wedding, but Shining Armor explains that he had no choice and Princess Celestia wanted an increase in security in response to an exterior threat. Twilight concedes but remains hurt. Shining Armor reassures her that she has always been, and always will be, important to him, and asks her to be his Best Mare.\nShining Armor explains that Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is the full name of Cadance, Twilight's former foalsitter. Twilight proclaims her to be \"beautiful, caring, and kind\" and \"the best foalsitter ever.\u201d A flashback shows that filly Twilight and Cadance used to frolic in the park, play on the swings, and resolve lovers' quarrels. Twilight remembers their chant:\n\"Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake!\"\n Twilight sees Cadance and eagerly reminds her of their chant. However, Cadance fails to recognize it and proves indifferent to Twilight. Shining Armor announces that Cadance will be monitoring the wedding planning. When he says that they are happy to have Twilight there, Cadance smiles at Twilight malevolently. Twilight begins overseeing the wedding preparations, starting in a castle kitchen Applejack has been provided. When Cadance shows up to check the catering, Applejack offers her an apple fritter, which Cadance insincerely calls \"delicious.\u201d Applejack gives Cadance a bag of fritters in case she forgets to stop for a meal, but when Applejack turns around, Cadance tosses the fritters into the trash.\nTwilight, incensed by Cadance's ingratitude, visits Rarity, who is working in the tower room she stayed at in Sweet and Elite. Twilight begins to describe Cadance's temperamental behavior, but Cadance arrives with her bridesmaids, (Lyra Heartstrings, Minuette, and Twinkleshine). Cadance ignores Rarity\u2019s greeting and appraises her dress. She says that she was hoping for more beading and a longer train, and turns her attention to the bridesmaids' dresses. Displeased, she demands that Rarity make them in a different color, despite the fact that her bridesmaids love their dresses. Rarity is more than happy to comply with the royal demands, but Twilight calls Cadance \"Princess Demandypants\" when Cadance is out of earshot.\nAfter nightfall, Cadance meets Pinkie Pie inside the castle ballroom. Pinkie presents her flamboyant reception plans, which include a board game, carnival music, and dancing. Cadance compares the setup to a \"party for a six-year old,\u201d although Pinkie Pie is oblivious to the insult. Meanwhile, Twilight has been eavesdropping on their exchange.\nPrincess Luna enters the shield and switches places with Princess Celestia on the tower balcony for the night. Meanwhile, the six friends and Spike are sipping drinks after a day of work. Twilight seizes the opportunity to find fault with Cadance, calling her the \"absolute worst bride-to-be ever.\u201d However, her friends rationalize Cadance's behavior. Fluttershy mentions that Cadance criticized one of the choir birds during rehearsal, but the bird in question was off-key. The friends suggest that Twilight is still being excessively protective of her brother, but Twilight insists that her friends are too preoccupied with wedding preparations to notice Cadance's attitude. Frustrated, she storms off.\nTwilight visits her brother's house and tries to talk to him privately, but is interrupted by Cadance, who is also intent on speaking with him. Twilight watches Cadance scold Shining Armor about a crest he is planning to wear with his dress uniform, which belonged to his favorite uncle. Shining Armor protests and Cadance swiftly casts a spell on him, making him to go wall-eyed. Frightened, Twilight runs away. Shining Armor sees Twilight running off and wonders what she wanted to tell him.Twilight runs to the castle to where her friends are staying. Her friends explain that Cadance has chosen them to be her new bridesmaids, and they interpret it as a reward for their diligence and evidence of Cadance\u2019s good intentions. Nobody knows where the former bridesmaids are or listens to Twilight's warning. Twilight leaves, saying, \"Looks like I really am on my own.\"\nThe wedding rehearsal takes place the next day, but Twilight is not there. When Shining Armor turns to take his wedding ring, Twilight bursts into the wedding hall, proclaiming that neither she nor Shining Armor should stand next to Cadance. Ignoring the inquiries of Fluttershy and Applejack, she approaches the podium and points at Cadance, crying, \"She's EVIL!\" While aggressively cornering Cadance, Twilight condemns Cadance's behavior towards her friends, the sudden disappearance of the bridesmaids, and the spell she cast on Shining Armor.\nCadance, bewildered by Twilight's accusations, runs away in tears. Twilight chases her out and proudly trots back into the hall. However, Shining Armor contradicts each of Twilight\u2019s accusations. He claims that Cadance's magic was intended to alleviate his migraines, which were caused by 24/7 maintenance of the protective magic barrier; Cadance replaced her bridesmaids because of their apparently shallow motivations; and her brusque behavior towards Twilight's friends appeared to be due to the stress of having to make all of the decisions for the wedding in her groom\u2019s absence defending Canterlot.\nShining Armor contrasts Cadance's efforts with Twilight's apparent lack of concern for the wedding. He dismisses Twilight from her position as Best Mare and suggests that she not attend the wedding at all. Her friends and Princess Celestia also leave to check on Cadance. Twilight is left in the wedding hall alone, where she laments the loss of a brother and a potential sister. She begins to doubt her opinion of Cadance.\n When Twilight is still in the hall, Cadance appears and comforts her, stroking her mane affectionately. When Twilight apologizes, Cadance's eyes turn green, and she says that Twilight will be sorry. Cadance summons a ring of green fire, which engulfs Twilight in a sphere of energy. Cadance walks out of the room as the sphere and Twilight sink into the ground."}, {"summary": " After a short recap of the events from the first part, Princess Cadance\u2019s imposter has trapped\u00a0Twilight Sparkle in the caves beneath Canterlot. The image of her false form appears on the crystal walls, and she hints at her plans for Shining Armor and taunts Twilight. Twilight shoots magic at the cackling reflections and blasts away a wall to reveal the real\u00a0Princess Cadance, startled and disheveled. Twilight quickly has Cadance at her mercy, believing her to be the imposter.\u00a0Cadance pleads with her, telling her that she had also been imprisoned inside the cave, but Twilight doesn't believe her. Cadance finally recites the \"Sunshine, Sunshine\" rhyme she had taught Twilight as her foal-sitter, which the imposter didn't know. Twilight's suspicions are banished, and the two embrace.\n In the song This Day Aria, Part 1, Cadance's imposter sings about how her plans will come to fruition as she prepares for the wedding in Canterlot, and the real Cadance sings about her determination to save her fianc\u00e9 as she and Twilight try to find a way out of the crystal caves. After the song ends, a camera pan shows that Cadance and Twilight are beneath the hall where the wedding ceremony is starting. Twilight teleports herself and Cadance to the cave's exit, but they are confronted by the bridesmaids: Minuette, Lyra Heartstrings, and Twinkleshine.\nCelestia is about to pronounce the couple mare and colt when Twilight and Cadance burst in. A flashback reveals that Cadance and Twilight distracted the bewitched bridesmaids with a bouquet of flowers before escaping from the cave. She declares the imposter to be a changeling, a creature that takes the form of a loved one and gains power by feeding off of love. The imposter, enraged, reveals her true form: Chrysalis, Queen of the Changelings. Chrysalis says that Equestria has more love than any place she's ever encountered, and conquering Equestria will give her and her changeling army more power than they've ever dreamed of. Even as she speaks, the changeling army is battering away at Canterlot's defenses.\nPrincess Celestia, infuriated at having been deceived, declares that even though Shining Armor is powerless, she will defend her subjects. She fires a white-golden beam of magic at Chrysalis, who retaliates with a green beam of magic. Chrysalis' beam overpowers Celestia's, smacking Celestia to the floor, knocking off her tiara, causing her mane and tail to stop flowing, and scorching her horn. Chrysalis is astonished by the power she has gained from Shining Armor's love. Struggling to remain conscious, Celestia instructs the six main characters to retrieve the Elements of Harmony, their only hope for stopping Chrysalis.\n The six ponies race towards Canterlot Tower where the elements are held. The changelings finally shatter the protective sphere and start wreaking havoc in the city. The six ponies are hemmed in by a crowd of hungry, vicious changelings, which take on the appearance of the six. Using everything from their hooves to Pinkie Pie's party cannon, the six ponies defeat the first wave of changelings. However, their reprieve is short; Canterlot Tower has already been overrun by more changelings. With the numbers stacked heavily against the Mane Six, they are eventually captured.\nThe changelings have imprisoned Celestia in a lime green goo cocoon in the wedding hall and glued Cadance\u2019s hooves to the floor with the same substance. Cadance insists that the six friends will save them, but a group of Changelings walk in with the friends held in custody. Chrysalis gloats that everyone but Twilight was too fixated on the wedding to notice anything. Applejack apologizes on behalf of the others for ignoring Twilight\u2019s doubts, and Twilight assures Applejack that she has no hard feelings. Chrysalis sings a stanza to the tune of This Day Aria as she observes the chaos in the streets below.\n Twilight frees Cadance and urges her to try and break the spell on Shining Armor. Cadance embraces him and breaks his trance with her spell of love. Shining Armor says that he doesn\u2019t have the strength to repel the changelings, but Cadance declares that her love will give him strength. The two connect horns, creating a powerful, bright pink, purple and white whirlwind of magic that lifts the couple into the air and shakes the room. When they look into each other's eyes, their bodies glow with bright white light and take on a heart shape as the magic expands outward as a bright, purple sphere. The ponies shade their eyes from the light, while Chrysalis and the changelings are thrown out of Canterlot. With the changelings gone, and Celestia free from her cocoon, the ponies prepare for the real royal wedding.\nAt the wedding, Twilight takes her reinstated place as best mare as their parents look on proudly from the audience. Celestia pronounces Cadance and Shining Armor mare and colt and levitates their rings onto their horns. Celestia commends the heroism of Twilight and her friends and emphasizes the importance of trusting one's instincts. The bride and groom step out to a balcony to wave to a crowd of cheering ponies. As Shining Armor and Cadance kiss, Celestia reminds Rainbow Dash to perform her sonic rainboom for the ceremony.\n The scene changes to the evening wedding reception in the courtyard, where the newlyweds start dancing. Princess Luna joins her sister and the Mane Six and unknowingly asks if she missed anything. DJ Pon-3 works her turntables and Twilight sings Love Is In Bloom while a montage of humorous and memorable photos taken during the party is shown. At the end of the party, Shining Armor thanks Twilight and they hug. Before departing, Cadance tosses her bouquet to the onlookers, which Rarity, in a screaming fit, snatches from the other bridesmaids. Twilight and her friends happily watch the royal carriage depart, and Spike unknowingly humors them by saying that he has even better plans for the bachelor party.

Spike tries to calm her down and says that it's just a test, but Twilight indignantly asks, \"Just a test?\" Spike puts on a helmet and shields himself with pillows before reluctantly answering \"Yes\". Applejack says, \"I think she handled that pretty well, considering-\" but Twilight screams and launches the entire library into the air to vent her frustration.\nMeanwhile, in Canterlot Castle, Princess Celestia and Princess Luna look at a new stained glass window depicting Princess Cadance and Shining Armor saving Equestria with the power of love. Celestia tells Luna that she should not go to the Crystal Empire because Twilight and her friends will join Princess Cadance and Shining Armor there. Luna fears for the collapse of the Crystal Empire again. Celestia reassures her that Twilight will succeed at her task, bringing her one step closer to \"being ready\". Twilight walks in with a saddlebag of quills, paper, and books, ready to take a written test. With a soft assurance from Celestia to trust her, Luna leaves the room to let the two speak alone. Celestia solemnly tells Twilight that she will not be taking the kind of test she is expecting.\n Princess Celestia tells Twilight that the Crystal Empire has returned. Twilight doesn't remember reading about the Crystal Empire, and Celestia says that very few remember its existence. She uses a pink crystal to create a three-dimensional model of the Crystal Empire, admitting that her knowledge about the empire is limited to the fact that it contains powerful magic. Celestia describes how King Sombra, an evil unicorn with a heart \"as black as night\", conquered the Crystal Empire and ruled tyrannically over its citizens. Celestia and Luna defeated King Sombra and banished him to the \"ice of the arctic north\", but not before King Sombra cursed the Crystal Empire and caused it to vanish.\nCelestia tells Twilight, \"If the kingdom is filled with hope and love, then those things would spread all across Equestria.\" Celestia fires a beam of her golden yellow magic at the crystal, illuminating the room in a rainbow of colors. She grimly continues, \"But if hatred and fear take hold...\" At which point, her horn glows purple and her eyes turn green (like those of King Sombra's) as she fires a pitch-black beam at it. The crystal casts a black shadow, and tall black crystals spring up around Twilight. Celestia shatters the black crystals and explains that she needs Twilight to protect the Crystal Empire.\nAs Celestia escorts her student out of the throne room, Twilight sees that Luna has been waiting by the double doors, but she only returns Twilight's look with a serious expression. Twilight fears that she will fail, but Celestia is confident in Twilight's abilities and guarantees her that she will move on to the next level of her studies after she saves the empire. Celestia gives her one last piece of information: in the end, it must be Twilight, and her alone, who ultimately helps her sister-in-law and brother protect the Crystal Empire. Receiving Twilight's affirmation, Celestia sends her on her way.\nTwilight steps out of the castle and sings The Failure Song to express how she doesn't feel prepared for the mission. She and her friends take a train to the outskirts of the Crystal Empire and disembark in the middle of a snowy, windy, wasteland. Shining Armor, wearing a scarf and goggles, meets them, and tells them to hurry because it is dangerous beyond the empire's borders. King Sombra suddenly appears in the form of great clouds of black smoke and starts pursuing the ponies. The friends break into a run and Shining Armor stops to confront Sombra. Sombra's black smoke dodges the beams of magic that the prince shoots at it and plunges straight at him as he braces for the attack.\nThe friends reach the safety of the Crystal Empire, passing through a bright blue bubble surrounding the empire. Shining Armor joins them, but his horn has become encrusted with small black crystals. He tries to cast a spell, but the crystals impede his magic and he sadly shakes his head at Twilight. The ponies gaze at the resplendent city and Pinkie Pie exclaims, \"Sparkleriffic!\" As the ponies walk through the deserted streets towards the castle, Rarity is dazzled by the crystalline roads and buildings, but Rainbow Dash is not wowed. Applejack reminds Rarity that they are here to help Twilight, not admire the scenery.\n In a room overlooking the Empire, the friends find Princess Cadance slumped on the throne. Her horn is constantly emitting blue magic and she has bags under her eyes. Cadance is excited to see Twilight, and they sing their \"Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake!\" childhood rhyme. Suddenly, thunder strikes outside, and Cadance's magic flickers. Shining Armor sadly explains that Cadance is exhausted from constantly maintaining the magical barrier to keep Sombra out. Cadance is so tired, she hasn't been able to get any sleep and barely eats any food. Cadance insists she's fine, but her husband tells Twilight that she can't keep the shield up forever. He says that they have been too busy to gather information about the Crystal Ponies (Rarity is ecstatic at the mention of \"Crystal Ponies\"). Twilight is more than happy to embark on what she calls a \"research paper\".\n Twilight and Spike attempt to interview the glum Crystal Pony Sapphire Joy. Sapphire Joy says she can't remember anything from the time before King Sombra came to power, nor does she want to remember. Apologizing for being unable to provide further assistance, she retreats to her house and closes the door. Rainbow Dash asks another Crystal Pony for information on how to protect the empire, but the pony responds in the same listless manner, saying that even though she wants to help, she has no information. Fluttershy is too shy to talk to the ponies passing by. Pinkie Pie, who is wearing a black suit and \"night vision goggles\", descends on a rope to eavesdrop on Elbow Grease and another Crystal Pony, but scares them away. Rarity is engrossed in imagining how beautiful her mane would be if she were a Crystal Pony too, and the ponies around her uncomfortably back away.\nThe friends reconvene at the base of the castle. Pinkie Pie, dressed up as Fluttershy, tiptoes up to Twilight and looks around before taking off her costume. Pinkie hisses, \"My cover has been blown. I repeat, my cover has been blown!\" Applejack says that the Crystal Ponies seem to have some kind of \"collective amnesia\", but one pony said something about the local library. The friends head to the library, an impressive three-floor facility. Twilight asks the librarian Amethyst Maresbury where the history books are located. Amethyst Maresbury can't remember where the history texts are located and says she isn't even sure if she works there. The friends look for the book and Twilight finally finds the book they need: History of the Crystal Empire.\nTwilight brings the book to Princess Cadance and Shining Armor. She reads aloud a section about the Crystal Faire, an annual festival that was established by the first queen. The annual Faire was held to restore the spirit of love and unity in the empire so they could protect it from harm. With Shining Armor's encouragement, Twilight takes on the task of setting up a Faire for the Crystal Ponies with her friends.\n The Mane Six sing The Ballad of the Crystal Empire while setting up the Faire. In keeping with tradition, Twilight crafts a crystal heart to showcase at the center of the Faire. With the preparations complete, Twilight announces the beginning of the Faire from the castle balcony.\nThe Crystal Ponies eagerly walk to the base of the castle where the Faire is located, and one by one, regain their beautiful crystal colors as they partake of the food and games. The same glum pony that Twilight had interviewed earlier tells her friend that she's starting to remember how life was like before the king. They look at each other, cry \"The Crystal Heart!\" and delightedly smile as they regain their former colors. When they wonder if the Crystal Heart is present at the Faire, Rainbow Dash assures them that they do: \"Can't have a Crystal Faire without a crystal heart, right?\" Amethyst Maresbury comments that the light within the Crystal Ponies powers the Crystal Heart and protects the empire. She regains her colors as she remembers that she does work in the library.\nRainbow Dash anxiously asks Amethyst Maresbury what she means by \"powering\" the Crystal Heart. Amethyst Maresbury, not knowing that the real Heart is missing, merely says she's glad they found it, considering Sombra said he hid it where nopony could find it. As she walks off for some funnel cake, Applejack and Rainbow Dash become extremely worried when they realize the significance of the actual Crystal Heart. Rainbow Dash tears a flag from a pole and covers the useless heart-shaped crystal with it, lest the Crystal Ponies find out that it is a fake. She tells Twilight that they have a problem.\n Rainbow Dash and Twilight meet the royal couple on the balcony. Twilight exclaims that the book said nothing about the Crystal Heart, and discovers that the last page was ripped out. Princess Cadance tells her it's okay but suddenly faints into Shining Armor's arms and gasps for air as the magical shield fades. Black smoke rushes across the perimeter of the Empire, weaving its way to the castle. King Sombra's face appears as he viciously growls.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode starts with a short recap of Part 1 and continues after Princess Cadance faints, causing the magical shield to vanish. King Sombra prepares to charge into the city, but Shining Armor helps Cadance recover in time to restore the shield. The shield slices off a small piece of his horn, which falls to the ground as a dark crystal. Twilight Sparkle instructs her friends to entertain the Crystal Ponies at the Faire while she searches for the real Crystal Heart. At first, she doesn\u2019t want Spike to come along on this dangerous mission, but she relents when he promises not to lift a single claw to help her. Meanwhile, the friends come up with ways to distract the Crystal Ponies. Rainbow Dash addresses Fluttershy as \"Knight Fluttershy\", announcing that it's showtime. Applejack prevents the carnival-goers from unveiling the fake Crystal Heart.\n Twilight deduces that King Sombra hid the Crystal Heart in the castle, since nopony would be brave enough to set foot in there during his rule. In the throne room, she finds a large crystal at the crest of the throne's backrest. Remembering how Princess Celestia replicated King Sombra's magic in the previous episode, Twilight does the same and the crystal's black light reveals a spiral staircase in the center of the room. Twilight begins her descent down the long, dark staircase, telling Spike to keep an eye on the situation outside. When Spike warns her that Cadance's magic is fading faster than ever, Twilight trips and tumbles down the staircase.\n At the bottom of the stairwell, Twilight replicates King Sombra's magic again to open a door. When Twilight crosses the threshold, she sees Princess Celestia in the Canterlot throne room. Celestia sternly tells Twilight that she has failed her test and is no longer her student. Twilight begins to cry as Sombra laughs. The camera zooms out to show Twilight sitting in front of a wall. Spike catches up with her and asks her if she is all right. The whites of Twilight's eyes, which have turned green, become normal as she snaps out of her vision. She steps out of the way and lets Spike approach the door. His eyes turn green and he cries, \"Please, Twilight, don't leave me!\" Twilight slams the door shut, telling him that King Sombra has bewitched the door to make it show their worst fears. She reassures Spike that she will never send him away and uses her magic to open the real door. They see a light blue staircase snaking up the exterior of a tower. Like the dark staircase, this one seems to have no end.\nThe scene changes to show Princess Cadance, whose magic is faltering as she struggles to keep it going. King Sombra\u2019s magic rapidly penetrates the kingdom, leaving two black trails. At the Faire, Crystal Ponies cheer as Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy, dressed in armor, prepare to joust with blunted lances attached to their chests. Pinkie Pie, seeing an ominous thunderclap, blows on her flugelhorn, signaling the two ponies to charge. Fluttershy panics when they collide and is launched in the air. Dash exhorts her to continue, saying that the fate of an empire rests on showing the Crystal Ponies a good time. Neither of them notice several buildings become tainted with Sombra's magic.\nThe camera cuts to Twilight and Spike wearily trekking up the staircase. Twilight looks up and is inspired to perform an anti-gravity spell, allowing her and Spike to slide \"down\" (up) the underside of the staircase. Whooping with glee, Twilight explains that she had studied gravity spells for her test.\n The camera cuts back to the Faire. As the sky darkens, Rarity frantically crafts traditional baskets and hands them to the Crystal Ponies, but runs out of materials. The ponies become aware that King Sombra has returned, and anxiously surround what they think is the Crystal Heart. Rarity and Applejack look up at the castle balcony, where Princess Cadance has collapsed in Shining Armor's forelegs. Pinkie Pie is juggling flugelhorns on a bouncy ball but slips. The ball knocks over the flag covering the fake Crystal Heart, which clatters to the ground before the shocked ponies. Rarity is about to say something, but is interrupted by Applejack, stating that the real Crystal Heart is on its way. Rarity whispers to Applejack that she was going to say that the Crystal Heart was being polished to buy time. As Applejack sheepishly realizes her mistake, Sombra's laughter echoes overhead. The citizens scatter, crying, \"It's him!\"\nTwilight and Spike reach the top of the tower to see the resplendent, light blue Crystal Heart suspended above a wide circular disc. When Twilight steps onto the disc, it begins flashing like an alarm and alerts King Sombra. He throws up a wall of black crystals around the perimeter of the disc, trapping Twilight. She knocks the Heart out of the prison just in time and it lands a short distance from Spike.\n An outside shot of the tower reveals it to be the center tower of the castle, the highest point of the building. Twilight tries to escape from the trap, but it teleports her back in. Realizing she cannot deliver the Heart herself, she tells Spike that he must do it. Spike grabs it and jumps off the tower just as black crystals pierce the floor. The camera pans to Applejack and Rarity nervously reassuring the Crystal Ponies from the castle balcony. The last few wisps of magic vanish from Cadance's horn and the barrier disintegrates. A Crystal Pony tries to make a run for it, but she bumps into a towering crystal, where King Sombra appears and says, \"My crystal slaves...\"Spike dodges the black crystals while making his way down the exterior of the tower. He calls down to the others that he has the Crystal Heart, and King Sombra growls, \"That is mine!\" He charges towards Spike as he runs down the spiral.\n Spike trips and the Crystal Heart falls out of his grasp. Shining Armor picks up the dazed Cadance on his back. She sees Spike and the Heart falling from the tower and spreads her wings. Shining Armor launches his wife into the air like a glider with all his strength, and she catches the Heart and Spike, just in time. As she flies back down to the ground, a Crystal Pony cries, \"Behold! The Crystal Princess!\" She lands among them, smashing the fake heart under her hooves. She firmly says:\n She tosses the Heart under the castle, and the snowflake pattern in the center glows bright blue. Two vertical crystal spires come together to keep the Heart in place. The Crystal Ponies regain their crystalline colors and bow to Cadance. Blue light spreads through the streets of the empire. The light suddenly retracts and concentrates inside the Crystal Heart, causing the heart to spin rapidly, generating a sphere of light that explodes and engulfs the empire. Cadance, Shining Armor, the Mane Six, and Spike become colored like the Crystal Ponies.\nAnother, more prolonged, concentrated blast from the Crystal Heart destroys Sombra's physical form and his black crystals, drives back his black clouds, and returns the castle and the Empire to its beautiful appearance. The crystal on top of the castle begins to shine. White light shoots up from the castle's base to the top crystal, and it fires a ribbon of energy into the sky which results in one final, ground-shaking blast of blue light above the empire that disperses the black clouds and dark skies forever. The ribbon radiates into many pink, blue, and yellow ribbons that look similar to the Northern Lights. The ribbons of light are visible from Ponyville and Canterlot. In Canterlot Castle, Princess Celestia and Princess Luna see the ribbons of light and cross their horns with a smile.\nThe Crystal Ponies resume their normal activities. As the royal couple accompany the friends to the train station, Shining Armor jokingly tells Twilight that she has to stop \"saving his rump like this,\" but she reminds him that Spike was the one who did it in the end. Shining tells her that it was just a test and maybe Celestia will just let her retake it, but Cadance touches him with her wing in a 'don't say that!' manner. Twilight remains pessimistic about her meeting with Celestia, leaving her brother and sister-in-law to watch after her with worry.\n In the Canterlot castle, Twilight admits to Celestia that she alone wasn't the one who saved the day in the end. Celestia tells her that by choosing to stay in the prison to save time, she put the safety of the Crystal Ponies before her own future. Celestia explains that she would rather have a student who understands self-sacrifice than one who puts her self interests first.\nTwilight happily announces to her friends that she passed the test, and they all celebrate by singing The Success Song. The friends triumphantly leave Canterlot on the Friendship Express. The camera zooms out and settles to show one of the palace balconies.\n As Celestia and Luna watch the train depart, Luna magically materializes a spiral-bound book. The princesses look at it, and nod at each other. The book has a dark cover which shows two stars and a swirly pattern. On the train, Spike says that he knew everything was going to be okay and dozes off."}, {"summary": " The episode starts with Twilight Sparkle and Spike outside the cafe seen in The Ticket Master, attempting to turn an apple into an orange. Just as Twilight is about to cast her spell, Pinkie Pie appears and gives her a hug around the neck, causing her to shift her aim; the spell ricochets and accidentally hits a bluebird. After a run in with Rarity, Pinkie worries that her friends could be having fun without her and dashes off, briefly visiting Rainbow Dash and Applejack and joining them in their respective activities. Pinkie then joins Fluttershy, who's simply sipping tea with Angel. Pinkie is relieved but faints due to exhaustion, saying \"fun is hard\" as the scene fades out.\n Pinkie Pie begins to feel better after resting in Fluttershy's \"butterfly grove\" and informs the Pegasus of her dilemma. However, Rainbow Dash shows up and invites Pinkie to join her after her weather work while she \"catches some rays\" at the lake. Coincidentally, Applejack invites Pinkie to attend her barn raising, which is scheduled for the same time, but both mares say that that it's simply an open invitation; whether she makes it or not is just fine. Pinkie, not wanting to choose between the two activities, decides to figure out how to race between the swimming hole and the farm the fastest. While doing so, she accidentally jumps on Twilight's back, causing her spell to ricochet again and hit a frog, transforming it into an orange and frog fusion. Explaining to the unicorn that she wants to basically be in two places at once, Twilight laughs and tells her the only way to do that would be if there were more of her to go around. This causes Pinkie to remember the legend of the Mirror Pool, a legendary lake underneath the Everfree Forest that can clone ponies, but she doesn't mention this specific detail to Twilight before she bounces away. Twilight knows of many legends, but is unfamiliar with this one. When Spike asks if this means that her spell practice is over, hoping she'll want to head home so she can do research on the legend, she brightly bursts his bubble.\nPinkie ventures into the Everfree Forest as she recalls the story and accompanying rhyme to find the pool, as it was taught to her by her \"Nana Pinkie\", reacting to her echoes and talking to herself. She accidentally falls down a hole in the ground and finds herself in an underground chamber housing the Mirror Pool. Pinkie walks over to the pool and then recites the chant to activate it, while stepping through the pool's surface.\nWhen she emerges, it's shown to not actually be her now climbing out of the water, but her own reflection having been turned into a clone of herself. Pinkie's clone starts shouting, \"Fun! Fun! Fun!\" and Pinkie tells her clone about Applejack and the farm. As they leave the Everfree Forest, Pinkie tells her clone that she has to meet her afterwards so she can tell her all about the fun in as much detail as possible.\n Pinkie goes to the lake to meet Rainbow Dash, who had thought she might have gone to the barn raising instead, to which Pinkie replies that she is probably still on her way there. Rainbow scratches her head in confusion. Meanwhile, the Pinkie clone is on the way to the barn raising when she passes by Fluttershy, who calls her over and asks if she would like to come join her picnic with her animal friends. Frantic about having to miss either the barn raising or the picnic, clone Pinkie goes to fetch Pinkie Pie. The clone explains the dilemma, and worriedly concludes that being unable to choose which fun activity to do has left her with having not done anything fun at all.\n Pinkie decides the solution is for her and the clone Pinkie to go back to the Mirror Pool, and they duplicate themselves into two more Pinkie Pies. However, the three clone Pinkies decide to clone themselves into six, then twelve, then even more, each clone being less coherent than the last, culminating in a small army of Pinkie Pies who can do nothing more than shout \"Fun!\" repeatedly and wreak havoc. Pinkie Pie tells them to knock it off and to follow her to Ponyville. After reassuring them it is fun there, they all hop after her. Pinkie Pie tries to keep them under control, saying they should have every nook in Ponyville covered, and quizzes them on the names of her friends, using a notepad with drawings of Applejack, Fluttershy, and herself. She tells them to fan out on three and begins counting, but they run off before she can say two, leaving her to say \"Good enough.\"\n Meanwhile, two clones tickle Rainbow Dash and make her sneeze. Rainbow Dash rubs her eyes and looks in shock as the clones wreak havoc by the pond, while the real Pinkie comes along with an inflatable raft, expecting to have fun and relax with her friend, until she sees all her clones. Rainbow Dash hides under her umbrella and chair, saying she doesn't want any more Pinkie Pies as they jump around her. Pinkie, feeling badly, runs off to check up on the barn raising at Sweet Apple Acres. Applejack, Big McIntosh, Apple Fritter and Meadow Song are raising the wall of a new barn, and are caught off guard when the Pinkie Pie clones jump around, shouting \"Fun!\" One of them jumps on Big McIntosh, who loses his grip on the rope.  Suddenly having only three ponies on a four-pony job causes the other three to quickly lose their footing and the holds of their ropes. The entire barn framework falls apart. Pinkie Pie shows up and is happy she hasn't missed it, but Applejack angrily tells Pinkie she wants to know where all the Pinkies came from. Pinkie awkwardly runs away, and her clones skip after her as Applejack angrily calls after them to clean up the destruction. Pinkie hides behind a haystack as her clones jump off and tearfully cries out, \"What have I done, what have I done?! My poor friends...\"\nOutside Golden Oak Library, Twilight is telling a mob of angry citizens, who have come to her for a solution, to calm down. Rarity and Fluttershy complain about Pinkies harassing them, causing the yelling to intensify. Twilight says to hold on while she tries to figure something out, rushing back inside with Spike. While they search the shelves for an answer, Spike finds a horseshoe embedded into the back of a bookshelf. He presses it and the back slides upward, revealing a dusty, old book. Twilight reads the book and learns of a spell that can send all the clones back. The only risk is that if they can't identify the real Pinkie Pie, they could send her into the lake by mistake, as the spell cannot tell the difference between a clone and a natural pony.\n Twilight and Spike run outside and ask the ponies if they know who the real Pinkie Pie is. The crowd is at a loss of how they could do so. Pinkie arrives and making her way to the front of the crowd, tries to ask Twilight for her help. Twilight tells Pinkie (as a clone runs over and mimics her) that she's not talking to any Pinkie unless she's dealing with the real one. Pinkie protests that she is the real Pinkie, only to have the name set off the clones as they run eagerly to the library and claim that they're the real one. The citizens run back to their homes and lock the doors. Twilight and Spike continue to find a way to send the clones back without sending their friend back in the process. Her very friends' inability to tell one Pinkie from another discourages Pinkie and she becomes depressed. Soon, she cannot tell if she is the real one herself.\nTwilight and Spike see the depressed Pinkie outside the cafe. Twilight figures that she's not the real one because Pinkie Pie has never sat that long in one place her entire life. As they walk away, Pinkie suggests they use a test to find the real Pinkie by making them do something very simple, but isn't fun at all. The Pinkie that wants to stay badly enough to make it to the end is the real one. Twilight decides that it's a good plan, and goes to implement it. Pinkie is initially thrilled that the problem can be fixed, but soon worries that she won't pass the test and will have to leave her friends. Twilight finds Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy and Rarity holed up with the woodland creatures until the \"Pinkie storm\" dies down. Twilight has them come with her to help with the plan, while the Apple siblings and their dog Winona round up all the Pinkies and herd them into the town hall (with the real one being carried in by Rainbow Dash because she was too depressed to come), and Big McIntosh and Apple Bloom shutting them in once their sister enters. Twilight makes the clones quiet down and sit in rows before she announces the test: to their collective horror, it's watching purple paint dry, freshly prepared by Rarity and Fluttershy on a backdrop wall. Nevertheless, the multitude of Pinkies anxiously leans forward when Twilight begins the test, eyes fixed on the paint.\n Time passes, and with no sources of stimulation nearby other than the paint, the attention span of the clones begins to flag and break. A clone in the front row looks out the window and says, \"Oh, hey, look at the birdie!\" Twilight instantly zaps her with a beam of magic, inflating her like a balloon and collapsing her into a wisp of pink light that flies to the Everfree Forest and vanishes back into the pool. Unable to withstand the insipid test, another clone calls out to the others to watch her try to bounce and touch the ceiling; Twilight zaps both her and the clone that turns to watch her. Yet another three clones are distracted by the transformed frog with an orange for a body croaking outside the window. A clone shows her neighbor how she can inflate her hoof so that tiny finger-like projections pop out from her other hoof; they are both sent away. One of the remaining clones says, \"Betcha can't make a face crazier than... this!\", vigorously rubs her face and changes her appearance to that of a Generation 3 Pinkie Pie. Twilight continues to rapidly eliminate clones until only two Pinkies remain. Rainbow Dash loses her patience and distracts the final clone by suddenly saying that she can see somepony making balloon animals. The distracted Pinkie is sent back to the lake, leaving only a single, concentrated Pinkie Pie who is still staring at the wall. She is the real one. Twilight says that she can look away, and Pinkie checks to see if she's the real one. Then she says she is.\n After everything is settled, Pinkie dictates her letter to Princess Celestia in her bedroom at Sugarcube Corner. Having learned that she sometimes has to choose which of her friends she'll spend time with and that even if she can't spend time with one friend, they'll always have more opportunities to spend time together. Pinkie then helps Applejack with her barn raising, spends time with Rainbow Dash, and leads Twilight and Big McIntosh, carting a boulder for Twilight, back through the Everfree Forest to close up the entrance to the Mirror Pool, just to be sure it never happens again. Once the letter is sent, Pinkie's friends gather outside Sugarcube Corner and propose several activities, but Pinkie just wants to sleep and does so in the middle of the shop floor. Fluttershy jokes that it looks fun, and everyone laughs. Twilight then uses her magic to close the door, so Pinkie can rest in peace.  \n"}, {"summary": " The episode starts out in Sweet Apple Acres with Apple Bloom worrying about what to wear to pick up her cousin, Babs Seed, at the train station. As time passes by, Apple Bloom starts overreacting and keeps trying on more outfits; finally Applejack tries to drag her along out of the house and to the train station. Apple Bloom, however, manages to escape and continues to search for the right outfit. Then, Applejack states that both Apple Bloom and Babs have something in common; neither pony has a cutie mark. As soon as she hears that, Apple Bloom rushes out of the house to have\u00a0Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo welcome Babs Seed together with her.\nApple Bloom brings along Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo to try and persuade Babs Seed to join the Cutie Mark Crusaders. When Babs arrives at the train station, Apple Bloom rushes up to her and introduces herself and the other members of the CMC. Babs looks overwhelmed and nervous. Scootaloo tells her that they have a big surprise for her, and covers Babs' eyes with her hooves. Later, she takes them away to reveal the Cutie Mark Crusaders' clubhouse. Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo act out the \"highlights\" in the clubhouse while Apple Bloom narrates the tour, Babs following along.\nDespite the CMC's efforts, Babs seems unimpressed. In an attempt to convince her to join, Scootaloo decides to show Babs the exceptional float they made for the Summer Harvest Parade. Unfortunately, just as Babs is about to say something, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon intervene, describing the float as \"funny looking\" and call the float a \"lamekin.\" The two keep berating the CMC until they cast their eyes upon Babs. Diamond Tiara nudges Silver Spoon, who peers at Babs over the top of her glasses and asks, \"Who's the new blank flank?\" Apple Bloom immediately comes to Babs' aide. Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon then heckle Babs, asking her if she's going to join the CMC's club. Babs thinks for a minute before she decides to join Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon, abandoning the CMC. Babs then takes the initiative to destroy the CMC's float by kicking off the front wheel. The float rolls out of the barn and down a hill and is smashed to pieces. Babs coolly remarks, \"Looks like somepony's pumpkin just got squashed!\" and Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon laugh.\nRecognizing Babs as a bully, Sweetie Belle suggests they tell Applejack. However, with Babs threatening retribution if they do so, Scootaloo and Apple Bloom think otherwise. After a song presenting the many different situations where Babs victimizes the Crusaders, the CMC return to the clubhouse. Upon discovering that Babs, Diamond Tiara, and Silver Spoon have occupied the clubhouse, Sweetie Belle bursts into tears.\nOnce again, Sweetie Belle suggests they talk to Applejack, but Apple Bloom diverts this by saying they need to fight back. She plots that they should make Babs the guest of honor at the Summer Harvest Parade. In order to do so, they secretly make a booby-trapped float the night before. Working in the small hours of the morning, they cover the basic frame of a float with paper taken from Carousel Boutique and cover the apple-shaped float with luster dust, a golden powder intended for use in cake decorating.\n As the Cutie Mark Crusaders are preparing to ride the float in the parade, Babs Seed, Diamond Tiara, and Silver Spoon come up to them. Babs is immediately blown away by the large golden apple float. Sweetie Belle asks, \"Isn't it smashing?\" Realizing that the word \"smashing\" could invoke violence, she begins stuttering, but Scootaloo cuts her off. Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon roll their eyes and walk away. Scootaloo warns Babs, telling her not to even think about riding the float, and that she had her chance. Apple Bloom elbows Sweetie Belle, and she leaps into the float to hit the switch to turn it on.\nAfter turning the float on, Sweetie Belle sets the kitchen timer with a devious grin. As she is doing that, Apple Bloom drags a mattress and positions it next to the float. Babs sees this as an opportunity to take the float, which she does. She shoves the CMC out of the way as they prepare to step into the float. She yells, \"See ya later, Cutie Mark Crybabies!\" and drives off. The CMC get up declaring that stealing the rigged float will teach her to not mess with the CMC. Suddenly Applejack appears, delighted that the CMC are letting Babs ride the float. Apple Bloom agrees, stating that they thought she should be the center of attention. Applejack praises them for their \"good\" deed and making Babs feel special after all of the heartache she had in Manehattan. The CMC, who are in anticipation of the upcoming disaster, stop, wide eyed. Applejack explains that she didn't say anything before because she didn't want to single out Babs. She then goes on, explaining that Babs had been getting teased constantly for her blank flank, and that she came to the farm to \"get away from all of her problems back home.\" At that, the CMC wilt with a guilty look on their faces. Applejack hands them colorful balloons, then praises them one more time for their \"good deed\" before walking away. The CMC then realize that Babs was bullying them only to avoid being bullied herself like she was in Manehattan. Desperately, the CMC try to find a way to stop the float from tumbling off the edge of the nearby cliff. They rush over to Applejack, and try to explain what they did, but their voices are drowned out by passing instruments in the parade.\nBy riding on Pinkie Pie's lettuce float, the CMC gather up enough speed to catch up to the golden apple float before it descends down the cliff and into muddy water. Scootaloo saves Babs by pushing her out of the driver's seat of the float, and the CMC end up falling into the mud at the base of the cliff instead.\n When the CMC are washing mud off themselves back at Sweet Apple Acres, Babs expresses her astonishment that the CMC saved her. The CMC regretfully explain how they booby trapped the float in order to get back at her, and became bullies themselves in the process. The CMC and Babs apologize to each other and resolve to \"start over.\" The scene changes to the clubhouse, where Sweetie Belle is reading from a scroll on a podium. The CMC swear in Babs as a new member of their club. Before returning to Manehattan, Babs promises to tell her big sister about her own bullies and to start a Manehattan branch of the CMC. When Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon come around, she revokes their friendship in defense of the CMC, exclaiming, \"That's not how you talk to my friends!\" She then threatens to tell Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon's mothers about their attitudes. They fearfully back away and fall in the mud. Babs then gets on the train and departs from Ponyville to her home.\n"}, {"summary": " One rainy night, a hooded mare gallops into an empty marketplace and enters a darkened curio shop. She begins to rummage around the shop until a small candle is lit. A stallion, who is the shopkeeper, comes out and asks if he can help her. Stepping behind the counter, he surmises that something powerful drew the customer to his shop; she points to an amulet inlaid with a crimson gem kept under glass on the shelf behind him. The shopkeeper identifies it as the \"Alicorn Amulet\", describing it as one of the most mysterious and powerful magic charms. When she indicates that this is what she's looking for, he warns her that the amulet is far too dangerous, but is quickly convinced to sell when she tosses a big bag of gold bits onto the counter.\nThe mare walks slowly to the amulet and an evil smile is reflected onto the glass dome.\n In Ponyville, Twilight Sparkle and Spike are over at Fluttershy's cottage. Some of Fluttershy's animal friends are there, and Fluttershy tries to tell them not to be scared but gives Twilight a sudden warning if anything happens to them. Spike tries to calm the yellow pegasus, but she is frantic about the safety of her animal friends. However, the animals appear to be excited about helping Twilight with her trick. Twilight assures Fluttershy that it will be okay and uses her magic to lift the animals. The animals glow with Twilight's magic and fly in the air while Fluttershy starts biting her hooves. The animals happily fly around in the air in the shape of an infinity symbol, and safely land on the ground. The magic trick is revealed to be practice in anticipation of Princess Celestia's visit with delegates from Saddle Arabia, and Twilight is in charge of the entertainment.\nSuddenly, Rainbow Dash zooms in and crashes into Twilight. She looks frantic about something and asks Twilight to come with her because it's an emergency.\nWhen Twilight races into town, she spots the hooded mare introduced at the start of the episode. The mare zaps Rarity, spawning a brown dress, which Rarity points out that the shades are used for accents. She faints as Applejack catches her on her back and walks away with Pinkie Pie.\nAs Twilight and Spike enter the scene, the mystery mare removes her hood and reveals herself to be Trixie, with the Alicorn Amulet displayed around her neck. Rainbow Dash begins to mock Trixie's magic skills, but she casts a spell on Dash, causing one of her wings to enlarge and making her lose balance. However, Snips and Snails still remain loyal to Trixie, but that does not move her. She fuses the two colts by the tips of their horns.\n Twilight demands Trixie to stop harassing her friends. She refuses and conjures a screen showing her life following her humiliation in the episode Boast Busters. It shows her wagon having been vandalized, dirtied with thrown tomatoes and eggs and the picture of a crudely drawn Ursa minor, complete with baby bottle, as well as an \"X\" across her cutie mark sign on the wagon. In the next flashback, a group of ponies laughs at her as she tries to perform her \"teleportation spell\" to run away. Another flashback shows Trixie working on Pinkie's family rock farm just to earn a living. Pinkie interrupts her, stating that she was lucky her family would hire somepony like her. Trixie then uses a spell and removes Pinkie's muzzle, preventing the pony from talking.\nTrixie vengefully challenges Twilight to a duel, but the purple unicorn declines. Trixie continues doing unkind things to convince her to say yes, such as turning Spike into a basketball, uprooting Golden Oak Library and throwing Twilight's books out, whom her owl, Owlowiscious, tries to grab. Twilight finally agrees to the duel. Trixie then removes all the spells she made, except Pinkie's mouth.\n Trixie makes the first move and blasts a heavy cart loaded with two barrels of apples into the air. Ponies scramble out of the way from where it's going to crash, but Shoeshine trips and is in danger of being crushed.\nTwilight takes control of the cart in time and sets it and its contents right again, just as Trixie hurls six large pies at her. Thinking quickly, Twilight conjures a parasprite, which immediately gobbles up the incoming pies. The creature burps up another parasprite, but Twilight removes both of them before they can reproduce again. She has barely recovered from the magical exertion when Trixie drops a large sheet of snow on Twilight and the vicinity. Twilight easily melts the snow and shoots a beam of magic at her opponent, causing a long mustache to grow on her face. Twilight's friends laugh and Trixie haughtily snips her facial hair off with conjured scissors.\nShe then summons Snips and Snails, who fearfully bow to her. She suddenly zaps them with a helical ribbon of red magic that lifts them into the air. When they fall back to earth, Snips has become a wailing foal and Snails has become a withered elderly pony. Twilight is shocked because only \"the highest level unicorns\" can perform age spells. She determinedly tries to reverse the age spell, but the power required is beyond her capabilities. Trixie promptly banishes her from town. Before Spike and her friends can join her, Trixie conjures a large glass dome that seals off Ponyville.\nJust outside the Everfree Forest, Twilight sweats over a flower, trying to de-age it to budding stage. At first she seems to have succeeded, but the second her magic lets go, it immediately returns to its natural age. Frustrated, she wonders how Trixie could know such advanced magic, and without Spike's magic flame, she can't message Princess Celestia, who is still in Saddle Arabia, for help. Considering who else she knows with knowledge of strange and powerful magic, she seeks the help of Zecora. The zebra promises to teach her more advanced magic so she can evict Trixie. Meanwhile, in Ponyville, Trixie has forced the citizens to become her slaves, and has conjured bad weather inside the glass dome. In the town hall, she forces Rarity to make banners showing her likeness, while Cloud Kicker, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy hang them up. Trixie rudely tells Mr. and Mrs. Cake to hurry up with her throne, which is made out of sweets (which baby Pumpkin Cake is sitting on). Applejack must hoof-press apples so Trixie can enjoy an applesauce facial. When Applejack refuses to do anything until Twilight is allowed back into town, Trixie conjures two feathers that tickle Applejack until she agrees to keep on working, and then hurls her into a pile of bushels full of apples. Trixie also forces Pinkie Pie to dance for her own entertainment. Rarity complains that Trixie's cruel magic is ruining Ponyville; downcast, she loses her concentration and the needle she is using pokes her in the hoof.\n In the forest, Twilight is concentrating on levitating three spheres of water around herself as she magically stands on the surface of a pool. Zecora balances herself on one leg as she recites, \"No noise, no sound, no din, no fuss, must interfere with your focus. Unlearn what you have learned, only then can victory be earned.\" Twilight, however, cannot focus because she can't stop thinking about Trixie's victory. She drops the water spheres and falls through the pool surface. Zecora states that Twilight must readjust her thinking before she can learn any of her lessons.\nWhen given the chance, the friends and Spike pour over dozens of Twilight's books, and Fluttershy finds one that has information about the Alicorn Amulet, but because of her quiet nature, she is outspoken by her friends. Finally, Spike takes the book from her and they read about the amulet. The book says that the wearer of the amulet gains amazing magical power, but it also corrupts the user to evil the more he or she uses it. In addition to this, due to a magical lock the only pony who can take the amulet off is the wearer. The friends convince a terrified Fluttershy to sneak out of the dome and contact Twilight. Rarity is inspired to create a \"dangerous mission\" outfit for her.\nTrixie is next seen riding a large wooden sleigh, which Snips and Snails (their ages back to normal) are laboriously pulling through the grass. Trixie even has a whip that she isn't afraid to use, and she is angry that somepony set off the magic force field. Snips points out that pulling the sleigh would be easier if it had wheels, to which Trixie says, \"the Great and Powerful Trixie doesn't trust wheels,\" and Snails comments that Trixie is getting \"weirder and weirder.\" They come across three irritated beavers who are whacking the dome with their tails. When Trixie asks them what they are doing, one of the beavers angrily chatters, emphatically gesticulates towards a log, and then the dome: they're trying to bring the log home, but the dome is in the way. Trixie rolls her eyes and lifts the dome so they can leave with the log. She then transforms the wooden sleigh to an elaborate golden bed, which Snips and Snails have to drag back. Making sure that Trixie is far enough away, the beavers drag Fluttershy out of the hollow log. Fluttershy, who is wearing the \"dangerous mission\" outfit complete with bunny ears, is petrified at the prospect of having to look for Twilight in the Everfree Forest. It takes half a dozen birds to drag her away from the safety of the log and towards the forest.\n After Fluttershy reunites with Twilight at Zecora's hut and informs her about the Alicorn Amulet, they discuss ways to beat Trixie at her own game. Zecora says that while she has learned all of her lessons, Twilight needs to \"use the six\". After figuring out the meaning of Zecora's words, Twilight writes a letter and sends Fluttershy back into Ponyville.\nTwilight and Zecora arrive at Ponyville's outskirts, where she meets up with Trixie through the glass dome. Twilight states she knows about the Alicorn Amulet and that Trixie cheated, but Trixie denies her accusation. Twilight then reveals that she was given a green amulet of her own from Zecora, bragging about how her amulet is \"from beyond the Everfree Forest\" and \"way more powerful\" than the Alicorn Amulet. Trixie scoffs at this claim, so Twilight preposes a rematch to prove it. Trixie points out that there's no need as she already beat Twilight, but Twilight casually baits her and says that she'll never get to see the \"totally awesome magic from beyond the Everfree Forest\" as she and Zecora begin to walk away. Unable to stand not knowing, Trixie dispels the giant dome and teleports over to them, begrudgingly accepting the challenge.\nTrixie performs yet another \"simple\" age spell, as she would call it, on Snips and Snails, transforming them both into foals. Twilight calls forth Rarity and Applejack, casting her own age spell on them. She continuously makes the two ponies different ages, between young and old and back again, and Trixie gapes in awe, declaring it as impossible. Then, Twilight creates a duplicate of Rainbow Dash, and \"grants\" Pinkie Pie the ability to simultaneously play ten instruments. She even turns Applejack into a stallion.\n Completely defeated, Trixie can do nothing but stare on in horror, with no way of making a comeback. When Twilight brags that her amulet is stronger than Trixie's, Trixie uses her magic to snatch it. Declaring that with it she'll rule all of Equestria with it, she takes off the Alicorn Amulet, its evil magic sputtering out, and puts on the green one. One of the Rainbow Dashes then nabs the Alicorn Amulet. Trixie at first protests, then remembers that she has Twilight's amulet now and fires a beam at Rainbow to make her writhe in agony, but it only tickles her. Proclaiming the new amulet to be defective, she demands the Alicorn Amulet back, but Rainbow says that the amulet is going back into hiding where it belongs, placing it in a small lock box held by Zecora.\nTwilight then reveals that the amulet Trixie stole from her is merely \"one of Zecora's doorstops\", just as it falls to the ground and shatters. Twilight explains to Trixie that all of her \"advanced magic spells\" were actually common magic tricks and illusions. In a flashback, Fluttershy gathers her friends and their families to read out Twilight's plan. In another that takes place in Carousel Boutique, Applejack begins to paint Apple Bloom orange to recreate her filly self as Pinkie Pie paints Big McIntosh and gives him Applejack's cutie mark to produce a stallion version of Applejack. Rarity dyes and combs Sweetie Belle's hair to make her look like Rarity as a filly. Fluttershy adjusts her Rainbow Dash wig in a mirror and exchanges a smile with Granny Smith, who has also been painted and disguised to look like an elderly Applejack. When Twilight was \"casting\" her spells during the duel, the different ages of Applejack and Rarity hid behind a nearby statue and revealed themselves in turn, creating the illusion of an effortless age spell. As the flashback plays, Twilight tells Trixie how she used a different kind of magic \u2013 the magic of friendship \u2013 to take on the Alicorn Amulet. When Trixie confusedly inquires about the pony with the ten instruments, Twilight cheerfully states it was not magic, but rather it was just Pinkie's sheer skill as performer, not unlike her one-pony band role in Swarm of the Century. The ponies then cheer at Twilight's victory against Trixie as the dark clouds looming over Ponyville disappear.\n In the next scene under the starry night sky, Princess Celestia and the two delegates from Saddle Arabia are watching Twilight's magic performance, in which she once again levitates Fluttershy's animal friends in an infinity symbol. Fluttershy finds it nerve-wracking and Spike tries to comfort her as Twilight puts on her show for the delegates. But as she places the animals down, she realizes that Trixie was adding fancy fireworks to the background. As Trixie puts her cape and hat on, she says that it was the least she could do after treating Twilight's friends and neighbors so horribly, recognizing that the amulet had been affecting her behavior. She then sincerely apologizes to Twilight for her vengeful ways, and Twilight accepts her apology. Trixie proudly asks her if \"the Great and Apologetic Trixie\" is the \"most magnificent humble pony\" she has ever seen. Twilight just smiles and shakes her head and Trixie leaves in a puff of smoke. As she canters away, she trips and falls, then gets up and keeps running. Before the iris out swallows the screen, Pinkie breaks the fourth wall again by jumping through the iris out and gesticulating towards her still-sealed mouth. Twilight uses magic to open a slit in the black screen and restore Pinkie's mouth. As Pinkie inhales deeply to speak, the credits immediately start playing.\n"}, {"summary": "Rainbow Dash compliments Scootaloo's scooter-riding. In the Cutie Mark Crusaders clubhouse, Scootaloo speculates that Rainbow Dash might become her mentor. Apple Bloom suggests that Scootaloo joins her, Applejack, and Rainbow Dash in camping at Winsome Falls that weekend. Sweetie Belle convinces Rarity to come as well. All the ponies except Rainbow Dash meet up at the edge of the woods. Rainbow Dash meets them at their first campsite. Rainbow Dash tells Scootaloo that they will be sharing a tent. At night, Rainbow tells the ponies a scary campfire story about The Olden Pony. Much of it is told offscreen. When she finishes, Rainbow Dash imitates The Olden Pony and asks, \"Who's got my rusty horseshoe?\" She scares the Crusaders by shouting that they do. Scootaloo mocks their fear while badly concealing her own in an attempt to impress Rainbow.\nRainbow Dash leaves Scootaloo outside the tent. Scootaloo\u2019s fears become more real when she is alone. She quickly enters the tent and falls asleep. Scootaloo \u201cwakes up\u201d when she hears a pony's voice outside. When she exits the tent, Applejack and Rarity's tents are gone. Scootaloo runs out of the clearing. When she looks back, she sees The Olden Pony following her.\n Scootaloo slows down and comes face-to-face with The Olden Pony when she turns around. When the pony asks about her horseshoe, Scootaloo gallops back to the campsite. On the way back, she sees Princess Luna in the trees. Scootaloo returns to the tent and finds that The Olden Pony has taken Rainbow Dash\u2019s place.\nScootaloo wakes up from the nightmare and attempts to prevent herself from going back to sleep.\nIn the morning, Scootaloo suffers from lack of sleep. However, she lies to Rainbow, saying that the previous night was the \"best night ever.\"\n Scootaloo sleeps in the cart as the ponies continue traveling. She wakes up when Applejack mentions that they may not reach the campsite before dark. Scootaloo rushes to check the path ahead and pokes fun at her fellow Crusaders' fear.\nScootaloo has a difficult time staying awake when traveling ahead on the path. She eventually returns to the other ponies. Worried, Applejack walks with Scootaloo, who is extremely jumpy. Scootaloo denies Applejack's concerns and moves away to pull the cart.\nThe ponies stop for the night in a large cave, and Scootaloo collects firewood. She only gathers a small amount because she is frightened by eyes she sees in the forest. At the campfire, Scootaloo unsuccessfully attempts to tell a happy story. Rainbow tells the story of The Headless Horse despite Applejack\u2019s interjections. When Rainbow finishes, Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle are frightened by the sparks from the fire. However, they quickly realize there's nothing to be afraid of.\n Scootaloo suggests singing campfire songs to stall before bedtime. Sweetie Belle sings \"Ninety-nine buckets of oats on the wall.\" When she finishes, the ponies go inside the cave to sleep. Scootaloo continues to find alternatives to sleeping, such as a dance competition or game of hide-and-seek. Applejack attributes this to Scootaloo's desire to spend time with Rainbow Dash. In her dream, Scootaloo is pursued by The Headless Horse\u2019s hoofsteps in a forest. The Headless Horse approaches her when she falls down a hill. However, Princess Luna appears and banishes the Horse. She explains that it is her duty as the princess of the night to step into ponies' dreams. Luna tells Scootaloo that when she wakes up, her greatest fear will still exist. Scootaloo admits that she is afraid that Rainbow Dash will find out that she was scared by the campfire stories. Luna says that everypony must face his or her fears. Scootaloo is uncertain, but the dream begins to dissipate.\nOnce awake, Scootaloo is still scared by Rainbow Dash's story of The Headless Horse. She leaves on her scooter when she mistakes Rainbow Dash's snoring for the Horse's whinnying. She slides down a hill and toward a river canyon when her scooter hits a rock. When she falls into the river, it carries her toward a waterfall.\n Rainbow Dash saves her as she falls over the waterfall and asks why she was outside. Encouraged by Princess Luna\u2019s silhouette in the moon, Scootaloo admits that she was scared and why she pretended to be brave. Rainbow Dash says that she was also scared when she first heard those stories. She promises to take Scootaloo under her wing, and the two hug. The next day, the ponies reach the Winsome Falls, large waterfalls of liquid rainbow. When the other ponies start a race, Rainbow and Scootaloo fly after them together. In a dreamscape forest, The Olden Pony asks Scootaloo for her rusty horseshoe. Scootaloo resolves to face her fear. When she does, Rainbow Dash appears and gives the horseshoe in question to The Olden Pony. She thanks them and walks away. On the side, Princess Luna winks and smiles at Scootaloo\u2019s solution."}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Rainbow Dash and her friends having a picnic underneath her cloud-house, waiting for the delivery of Rainbow Dash's Wonderbolt Academy acceptance letter to her mailbox, which is situated on the ground close by. Rainbow Dash is confident that she will be accepted, while Pinkie Pie is far more nervous. When the letter arrives, Rainbow Dash seizes the letter from the mailpony. She quickly reads it and sadly announces, \"I... didn't get in.\" Her friends gasp in dismay, but she cries, \"Gotcha!\" and shows them the green check mark on the letter. Pinkie Pie abruptly embraces Rainbow Dash and clings to her tightly, exclaiming how happy she is for her with a bone-crushing hug. When Rainbow Dash departs to the Academy for a week's stay, Pinkie pulls out a massive megaphone and shouts: \"Don't forget to write!\" The volume of the exclamation echoes in the mountain scenery around them, though Pinkie Pie worriedly asks her friends, \"Do you think she heard me?\"\n Rainbow Dash arrives at the Academy. She stands in line with seven other Pegasi, some of whom appeared in Hurricane Fluttershy, such as Thunderlane and Cloudchaser. Wonderbolt captain Spitfire, in dress uniform instead of her flightsuit and a whistle around her neck, walks past the candidates and emphatically tells them they do not have what it takes to become an elite flier. When Spitfire tries to intimidate Rainbow Dash, the latter confidently declares, \"I'd never quit, ma'am!\" bringing out a smile of approval from the captain. The next pony in line, Lightning Dust, is eager to prove her worth, prompting Spitfire to command the fliers to fly five hundred laps. Rainbow Dash and Lightning Dust equal each other in their speed, easily outstripping the other Pegasi. They learn each other's names and agree to go to the mess hall.\nOutside Sugarcube Corner in Ponyville, Pinkie Pie is eagerly checking her mailbox every few seconds, looking sad when it remains empty. Applejack tells her Rainbow Dash has not been gone for twenty-four hours yet, and tells her to give Rainbow time to settle in. Applejack suggests that they should go and watch Twilight practice some new spells assigned by Princess Celestia, but Pinkie is not persuaded and remains by her letterbox, continuing checking its contents once every few seconds.  \n Back at the Wonderbolt Academy, Rainbow Dash and the other seven Pegasi are now wearing cadet flightsuits, and are apparently training together as part of the same cadet class. Spitfire unveils a contraption called the Dizzitron, a spin-out simulator. The Dizzitron works by spinning the Pegasus around in circles, disorientating them. The Pegasi's task is to recover quickly from the \"spin-out\" upon being released from the contraption, fly in a straight line as soon as possible, and come in for a smooth landing. Although Rainbow Dash and Lightning Dust volunteer to go first when Spitfire asks, it was apparently a rhetorical question as she chooses in order of line up. The first mare to go on the Dizzitron is completely winded and almost crashes in front of Spitfire, who says that the mare's time of fifteen seconds is decent. Rainbow Dash is next in line and effectively returns to Spitfire in six seconds, setting a new Academy record. The first mare tells her admiringly that she made it look so easy, to which Rainbow grins back and says that's because she makes everything look easy. Third in line, Lightning Dust flies up to the Dizzitron and requests Spitfire to set the Dizzitron on maximum speed in order to test her limits. Spitfire permits this, and despite the increased difficulty, Lightning Dust manages to return in six and a half seconds.\nAfter the whole class have had their turn, Spitfire announces she will be pairing them up for the rest of the camp, with one cadet being a lead pony and the other being a wingpony; she will post the team assignments in the morning.  Rainbow Dash assumes that she will be the lead pony of her pairing, but when she checks the posting in the mess hall at breakfast, she is disappointed to find that while Lightning Dust is her partner, she was assigned to be wingpony instead.\nIn her office, Spitfire is stamping a stack of Wonderbolts posters with a horseshoe-shaped stamp when Rainbow Dash enters and asks her about this decision. Spitfire tells her that she paired them together because she believes they'd make an unstoppable team.  However, Rainbow expresses her thoughts that while that's likely true, she feels that she deserves to be lead pony. Spitfire then explains that she gave Lightning Dust the lead position because Lightning Dust likes to push herself, a little more so than Rainbow Dash does. Rainbow is of course still disappointed, but acquiesces to Spitfire's decision and leaves.\n The next day, Lightning Dust shows Rainbow Dash her golden lead pony badge, which she secures on her chest.  Rainbow is still feeling a bit down about being wingpony, but that's the extent of it.  The class is divided into two teams of four, red and blue, and are told that the team which captures the most flags of the opposing team's color wins.  Additionally, the pairs of lead pony and wingpony must remain together or be disqualified, which would effectively cut a team from four ponies to only two.  In the process, Rainbow Dash spots the first flag in a narrow ravine, which has two logs closely placed across the top, making the approach much tighter. Lightning Dust determinedly drives forward, ignoring Rainbow's observation that if they were to continue to fly at this speed into the ravine, both would not be able to fit at the same time. Lightning Dust pushes ahead; as she must keep up or disqualify the two of them, Rainbow flies right behind her as she already knows that they will have to enter one after the other. However, with Lightning Dust's body in the way, she can't see exactly how tight a squeeze it's going to be. Consequently, as Lightning Dust flies into the ravine first, she tucks in her wings to avoid grazing the logs, but since Rainbow can't see, she keeps her wings open and her right wing clips a log, injuring it. The two then return the flag to Spitfire, though Rainbow is now lagging a bit and is hesitant to immediately continue due to her injured wing. Lightning Dust chooses to ignore her partner's injury. Pressured by the expectant Spitfire and Lightning Dust, Rainbow obliges to continue in the exercise.\nBack in Ponyville, Pinkie Pie is still in front of her mailbox, though her mane looks disheveled and unkempt. Rarity, Fluttershy, Applejack, and Twilight are watching her from a distance. Pinkie is distraught that it has been three days and Rainbow Dash still has not sent a letter yet. Twilight suggests Pinkie Pie send a letter to Rainbow herself. Though Pinkie embraces the idea at first, she becomes paranoid and is terrified by the possibility that Rainbow has forgotten them already. Pinkie enumerates other possibilities, such as the letter being lost in the mail or another pony receiving the letter. She ultimately decides to send a care package to Rainbow in person. The friends agree, though Pinkie advises them, \"Don't be upset if she doesn't recognize you at first. It might take a while for her to get her memory back.\" \nBack at the Wonderbolts Academy, Spitfire instructs the Pegasi to fly their famous air obstacle course, which challenges their precision and ability to adapt in different weather environments.  She adds that as this is not a race, to not worry about winning, however Lightning Dust winks at Rainbow Dash, implying that she's going to do just that anyway.  Held up behind another pair, Lightning Dust expresses frustration that they can't get around them.  Rainbow attempts to mollify her partner, pointing out that they can show off their synchronized flying to Spitfire instead; Lightning Dust grudgingly agrees. Flying behind the same pair in the midst of a stormy setting, Lightning Dust impatiently mutters, \"What are they, a couple of snails? It's just a little weather.\" Once the air clears however, Lightning Dust grabs the opportunity to carelessly soar past them, tossing the rest of the pairs aside in a spin-out. Commending their record time, which does please Rainbow Dash, Spitfire gives Lightning Dust and Rainbow an early leave to the mess hall. When she leaves to help sort out the other teams affected by Lightning Dust's recklessness though, Rainbow expresses her discomfort to her partner, saying, \"Next time, maybe we don't cut the other teams off like that.\" Lightning Dust rebuts, \"Hey, you snooze, you lose!\"\nThe last straw comes in a training exercise where the pairs are required to clear clouds from the sky. Even though Rainbow Dash points out that the pair are way ahead, Lightning Dust proposes that they work together to make a tornado, a tactic that will blow away their competition. Recalling Spitfire's comment that Lightning Dust pushes herself more, Rainbow agrees to the plan. Though the tornado is initially successful in clearing the clouds, Lightning Dust loses control of it and the tornado ends up whirling off-course. At this moment, Rainbow's friends show up in the Twinkling Balloon to deliver the care package.\n They get sucked in, and the lines connecting the hot air balloon's basket to the balloon are snapped by the tornado's winds, sending the friends through the air. Rainbow sees them and quickly corrals some clouds to cushion their fall. She then releases the cloud, propelling the friends back into the air, where they are safely caught by the other Pegasi, Rarity gratefully embracing Thunderlane, and Fluttershy awkwardly detaches herself from Cloudchaser's grasp, annoying Cloudchaser. As the rest of her class and other cadets gather around, Rainbow touches down on the plateau to determine whether or not her friends are okay, and goes to check on Pinkie Pie, who is absolutely overjoyed that she still remembers her.\nLightning Dust triumphantly exclaims, \"That... was... awesome!\" but Rainbow Dash is enraged that her friends were put in mortal peril. Lightning Dust shows an appalling lack of concern for Rainbow's friends or their classmates, only caring about how many clouds the tornado took out, an attitude that the surrounding cadets are shocked and offended by. Lightning Dust even has the gall to extend for a hoofbump, but Rainbow Dash pushes down her hoof and goes on to criticize Lightning Dust's poor judgment during the previous exercises. Rainbow fully understands the need to be the best, but Lightning Dust is trying to be the best in all the wrong ways. Lightning Dust retorts that her results are apparently what the Wonderbolts are looking for, as Spitfire had made her the leader of their pair, to which Rainbow Dash grimly agrees.\nRainbow pays another visit to Spitfire's office and informs her of Lightning Dust's decision to use a tornado to bust the clouds. While effective, Rainbow is upset that the tornado nearly took out her friends. She declares that there is a difference between pushing oneself as hard as one can and being reckless. She states that she doesn't want to be part of the Wonderbolts Academy if they reward recklessness, like Lightning Dust had displayed. Turning in her wingpony badge onto the stunned Spitfire's desk, Rainbow quits the Academy, and her friends comfort her on the field. Rarity exclaims in confusion that being a Wonderbolt was Rainbow Dash's dream, but Rainbow replies it isn't anymore.\n Nonetheless, before she can leave, Spitfire (a little ticked off that Rainbow didn't give her a chance to respond) catches up to her and affirms her argument. She goes on to say that while they do want the best flyers in Equestria, Rainbow was correct about the well-being of other ponies being ahead of recklessness, and pushing themselves must always be in the right direction. The two Academy staff members who have been assisting Spitfire throughout the episode then bring over Lightning Dust, from whom Spitfire literally rips the lead pony badge off, stripping her of her position as lead pony, and sends her away. As Lightning Dust sadly walks away, escorted by Spitfire's two assistants, Spitfire gives the badge to Rainbow Dash and tells her that she's no wingpony, but a leader. Rainbow reacts by repetitively saying, \"Oh my gosh!\" and fluttering her wings in exultation. \nAs soon as Spitfire gives Rainbow her orders, she flies up to the rest of her class, who salute her as a leader. Rainbow guides them into the sunlight, while the rest of her friends watch from below. Pinkie Pie yells after Rainbow Dash, \"Wait! You didn't even get to open your care package!\"\n"}, {"summary": " In the Sweet Apple Acres barn, Applejack and Granny Smith are taking out family heirlooms from boxes. Apple Bloom is sorting through dozens of RSVPs for the upcoming family reunion, sent from family members living in Yonder Hill, Hollow Shades, Galloping Gorge, Foal Mountain, Fillydelphia, Tall Tale Town, and Appleloosa. Apple Bloom is particularly excited to see Babs again. Granny is surprised that so many relatives will be coming, and says that they might need a bigger cider trough.Since Granny has gotten \u201ca little rustier in the giddy-up\u201d since the last reunion, she allows Applejack to take charge of organizing the reunion. Granny shows Applejack and Apple Bloom a photo album with pictures of past reunions, where ponies worked on an old quilt, made apple fritters, ran seven-legged races, and took big family photos. Applejack makes mental note of the supplies needed for these activities. Granny says that the entire family will be coming this time, and not everypony might have time to attend the next reunion. Applejack promises to make this \u201cthe most memorable reunion\u201d they've ever had.\n That night, Applejack can\u2019t fall asleep because she is still anxious about the reunion, and Apple Bloom can\u2019t fall asleep because she is excited about hanging out with Babs. Applejack gets her second wind, realizing the responsibility that Granny Smith has entrusted her with, and continues brainstorming. Apple Bloom falls asleep on the bed, and Applejack tucks her in, saying the reunion will be worth the wait. The next morning, Applejack pulls Apple Bloom out of bed, saying they don't have much time; preparations for the reunion are underway. They join Big McIntosh and harvest apples by bucking trees. Applejack collects rolls of fabric from Rarity, jars of honey and glitter from Pinkie Pie, and buckets of rainwater with assistance from Rainbow Dash. Big McIntosh chops logs for firewood, and Applejack (with help from Spike) lights a fire under a row of cauldrons of cooking oil. The last of the decorations is put up just as the family arrives on foot and in pony-drawn wagons, carriages, coaches, and zeppelins. Granny Smith hugs her cousin Apple Rose, and dozens of Apple family members exchange similar warm greetings. Among those present are Braeburn from Over a Barrel, and Hayseed Turnip Truck from Sweet and Elite.\nApplejack uses a megaphone to welcome the family and give a rundown of the first couple of activities. In the crowd, Babs Seed surprises Apple Bloom and the two start chatting, but Applejack butts in and eagerly shows them the elaborate seven-legged race and obstacle course. The fillies doubt they will have time to catch up while racing against their other cousins, but Applejack urges them to \u201cmake some memories\u201d during the race.\n Applejack goes to check on the quilt. Granny Smith, her cousin Apple Rose, and Auntie Applesauce are reminiscing when Applejack tells them that she replaced their traditional rocking chairs with sewing machines. The three elderly mares are put off by the sudden change, but Applejack insists that they can finish the quilt that they\u2019ve been working on for many reunions. The elderly mares start sewing, but the sewing machines are too noisy to permit conversation. Meanwhile, Apple Bloom and Babs try to catch up, but are too occupied with the race's complicated legs. Applejack checks on the ponies making apple fritters and tells them to pick up the pace, leaving no time to socialize. Everypony except Applejack is becoming aware that very little fun is being had at this reunion.\n When Applejack finally calls for a break, the quilt is practically an acre long, enough fritters have been made to feed all of Ponyville, and everypony is utterly exhausted. Applejack wants to take some photos for Granny Smith's album, but sees that no one is having much fun. She organizes a hayride around the farm (once again preventing Apple Bloom and Babs from hanging out) and, in an effort to shake things up, makes the ride much faster than expected. The wagon barrels down the road toward Sweet Apple Acres' west orchard where, according to Granny Smith, something has taken up residence. Applejack bucks an apple tree and stirs those \"somethings\" from their sleep: fruit bats of assorted colors. They fly over the wagon and form a rainbow across the sky that impresses the family members. But disaster quickly strikes when the fruit bats notice the apples in Auntie Applesauce's hat. They swoop down and cause the wagon to swerve off the road. The ponies riding in the wagon jump ship just before the runaway wagon crashes into the barn, completely destroying it. Realizing what a mess of things she's made, Applejack hides her face in teary shame.\n Applejack tearfully looks at the ruins of the barn, lamenting that everything is ruined. She apologizes to Granny Smith for ruining the reunion, but Granny tells her that she had everypony \"so caught up in all the doin'\" that they were unable to simply enjoy each other's company. Even then, Applejack remarks that the only thing anypony will remember is that it was the worst of all reunions. Granny assures her that there's still time to make good memories. Applejack recalls that at the end of each reunion there was an Apple family photo taken in front of the barn, but the barn is no longer there. Applejack announces she has one more activity to remember for the right reasons. Applejack rallies the family together with a square dance-like song as they work together to rebuild the barn from the ground up. Unlike the previous activities, however, everypony has fun working and dancing together. At the song's end, the ponies gather before the newly finished barn for the family photo, and the reunion closes on a high note. Apple Bloom and Babs say their goodbyes, and Granny congratulates Applejack on a job well done. That evening, Applejack writes her friendship report to Princess Celestia. She writes that when you're with family, you don't have to do much to make that time memorable because the simplest activities will be meaningful. The episode ends with two shooting stars passing over Sweet Apple Acres."}, {"summary": " The episode opens at Twilight Sparkle's library in Ponyville. Princess Celestia has assigned twelve books for Twilight to read over the course of a weekend. Realizing how busy such an assignment will be keeping her, Twilight gives Spike the day off. Spike jumps at the chance to do things he's been wanting to do, such as touching his nose with his tongue, playing bongos on his belly and smelling his own feet, but quickly runs out of things to do when it turns out he's not as good at putting together to-do lists as Twilight is.\n Bored, Spike wanders through Ponyville for a bit before deciding to take a ride in the Twinkling Balloon. In his excitement though, he accidentally undoes the balloon's rope tether, and it takes off without him. He chases the runaway hot air balloon across Ponyville, nearly crashing into Granny Smith in the process, and eventually catches it as it floats over the Everfree Forest. Spike re-tethers the balloon to the ground before realizing where he's ended up. The horrors of the Everfree Forest\u00a0are quickly made apparent to Spike, and he's confronted by a pack of three\u00a0timberwolves. They chase him through the forest and soon corner him. Just before the timberwolves can make a quick meal out of the dragon, however, Applejack comes to the rescue. She distracts the beasts so that Spike can get away, and the timberwolves chase after her. Applejack, proving to be far more resourceful than Spike, dispatches the wolves and leaves them as piles of leaves and tree bark. Spike marvels at Applejack's skills and thanks her immensely for saving his life. It turns out that Applejack was in the Everfree Forest because she'd seen the runaway hot air balloon and came to investigate. With the balloon retrieved, Applejack and Spike leave the forest together. Behind them, the shattered remains of the timberwolves magically come alive.\n Applejack thanks Spike for walking her home and goes to see to her chores. Still thankful to her for saving his life, Spike offers to do Applejack's chores for her. She initially turns down his gesture, dismissing her actions as something friends do for each other, but relents when Spike is insistent. Finally, Applejack tells Spike that he can help Apple Bloom with whatever she needs. Spike ends up helping Apple Bloom wash a dirty pig. At first, Spike's services\u2014while somewhat clumsy\u2014are indeed helpful, as far as Apple Bloom is concerned. But as time goes by, and Spike becomes ever more determined to assist, and as a result, large messes are made.\nApplejack once again tries to send Spike on his way, but the little dragon will hear none of it, explaining that his intent to help is part of his 'dragon code'; he owes his very life to Applejack. Granny Smith mentions Twilight, and Spike comes to a realization: he has to \"break the news\" to her. He returns to the library and finds Twilight studying. He explains to her that Applejack saved his life and that, according to his dragon code, he must now serve her for the rest of his life. Unfortunately, Twilight did not pay any attention due to her obsession with studying and simply said \"Mhm\". Heartbroken and teary-eyed, he leaves to start his new life at Sweet Apple Acres.\nApplejack and Granny Smith are beyond surprised to hear that Twilight's given Spike her \"blessing\", and Spike, still committed to serving Applejack, proceeds to make a mess in the kitchen that Applejack and Granny Smith just got through cleaning. The two look to each other in profound worry.\nApplejack explains to Spike that she respects his adhering to his dragon code, but she's uncomfortable with his devout servitude to her. Spike disputes that the dragon code is a part of him, that he must be true to himself, and that defying it means he's no longer a \"noble dragon\". Applejack has no intention of belittling Spike's integrity and quickly looks for something for him to do\u2014something that won't end up with him making a mess or getting himself hurt. They decide to take the pie he helped make to Rarity.\n Rarity eyes the pie Applejack and Spike brought her with a wince, but a facial cue from Applejack tells her she shouldn't disappoint him. She samples the pie (which, judging from her expression, is clearly inedible), and Spike\u2014at Applejack's behest\u2014excuses himself to do Rarity's dishes. Applejack gives Rarity the full story: she saved Spike's life from timberwolves, and now he's forever indebted to her. Instead of being sympathetic to Applejack's plight, Rarity expresses envy. This sentiment doesn't last long, as Spike quickly makes a mess of Rarity's kitchen as well, to which Applejack comments \"sometimes Spike's help isn't that helpful\".\nIt's at this time that Rainbow Dash makes her entrance and is too given an explanation of Applejack's predicament. Rainbow believes she has the solution: task Spike with something exceedingly difficult and drive him to quit. She gives Spike such a task: build a large tower of rocks for Rainbow Dash to smash through. Believing this to be a request of Applejack's, Spike naturally accepts. To Rainbow Dash's surprise though, he doesn't give up, and ends up stacking a large tower of rocks as requested. Rainbow Dash follows through on her bluff and brings the tower down, leaving her in a daze. With that done, Applejack takes Fluttershy's advice and tells Spike she can't think of anything else for him to do. Desperate, Spike rationalizes that maybe she needs help thinking of things she needs help with, like her back needs itching, to remember her favorite song, even breathing.\n Applejack is at her wit's end. She seeks out Twilight, who's still muzzle-deep in a book. When Applejack manages to finally get Twilight's attention, she explains what she believes Twilight to already be aware of: that Spike is following his dragon code and serving her forever for saving him from timberwolves. This is news to Twilight, who was too distracted to be aware of anything that was going on around her. But now that she's brought up to speed, she has the answer. Applejack keeps Spike occupied while she convenes with her friends (now including Pinkie Pie) in the barn. The plan: have Spike save Applejack's life from a timberwolf!\n Just outside the Everfree Forest, Applejack and the others make ready to put their plan into action. Before Rarity could call into question her believability as a \"damsel in distress\", Spike approaches, prompting everypony to take their places. As Spike is put to the task of gathering leaves, the plan is put into motion. Rainbow Dash roars like a timberwolf, Rarity flees and screams past in terror (while Pinkie Pie screams for the fun of it), Twilight brings a timberwolf puppet to life with her magic, and Fluttershy (with buckets tied to her hooves) makes the \"timberwolf's\" clomp sounds. During this, Applejack pretends to get her hoof caught in a pile of rocks, unable to get away. This appears to have Spike fooled at first, but he soon catches on, citing the lack of timberwolf breath as a dead giveaway. But when he catches the whiff of an actual timberwolf's breath, and Twilight and Rainbow Dash panic, the fake threat is made genuine: real timberwolves have appeared!\nAs Applejack and Spike run away from the attacking wolves, Applejack climbs to the top of a pile of rocks and pushes a large boulder onto them as they run past; they're smashed to pieces. Suddenly, the rock pile collapses underneath her, and she takes a tumble and actually gets her hoof stuck. Like before, the remains of the timberwolves come alive and assemble into a single, much larger Timberwolf King. Applejack tells Spike to run, but Spike resolves to stay and save her. He chucks one of the smaller rocks at the giant timberwolf, and it becomes lodged in the beast's windpipe. The timberwolf starts choking. Spike pries Applejack's trapped hoof loose, and the two run away as the giant timberwolf \"dies\" of suffocation.\n Applejack's friends are surprised to hear that she'd actually gotten herself stuck, and she both thanks Spike for saving her and apologizes for attempting to trick him. Reconciling, the two agree if one ends up saving the other's life in the future, to say \"that's what friends do\" and leave it at that (on the condition that they try to avoid such situations). They seal the deal with a hoof/claw-bump.\nThat evening, Twilight is back in her library studying in the dark. Spike walks up with a lit lantern, and she thanks him. Spike hugs her leg, saying he's \"really really really happy to help\", and Twilight laughs.\n"}, {"summary": " In a field just outside Ponyville, Twilight Sparkle, Spike, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie are awaiting the arrival of Princess Celestia; Pinkie even got her hooves shined for the occasion. Twilight wonders why the princess is taking so long and notes Applejack and Fluttershy's absence, to which Rarity explains that Fluttershy is assisting Applejack with a \"mishap at Sweet Apple Acres\" and assures they'll both be along shortly. Twilight points out that the princess' being late could be due to the presence of an important visitor, and she and her friends speculate who it could be. Spike gasps at something off-screen: something with \"a deer antler, a goat leg, a bat wing, and a snake tail\". Twilight quickly deduces that he's describing Discord, and she and Rarity brush off the notion. But as they turn around they are shocked by what Princess Celestia has with her.\n Twilight unintentionally snaps at Celestia for bringing Discord to Ponyville; her friends each have their own reservations about this as well. The princess understands the risks and explains that she has a use for Discord's magic if it can be reformed to serve good instead of evil, and entrusts Twilight and her friends with that very task. Twilight is still unsure but supposes that, should things get out of hand, the Elements of Harmony could be used to imprison Discord again. As a precaution, Princess Celestia has even charmed the Elements to be immune to Discord's trickery. Celestia then asks where Fluttershy is, believing her to know best how to begin reforming the spirit of chaos.\nAt Sweet Apple Acres, Fluttershy is settling a dispute between Applejack and an angry beaver; the construction of a dam has caused a stream to get backed up and flood the surrounding orchard. The beaver, a \"Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth\",\u00a0agrees to move the dam, but only\u00a0once Applejack apologizes for calling him a \"nuisance\". Applejack then shouts that he's lucky that she didn't call him a varmint. The beaver\u00a0responds with\u00a0some very unkind words that Fluttershy feels best left untranslated, and then gives Applejack a glare.\u00a0 After some pride-swallowing, Applejack agrees, but\u00a0Fluttershy quickly\u00a0reminds her to not retaliate when the beaver\u00a0blows a\u00a0raspberry as a parting shot.\u00a0\u00a0Examining the dam, the beaver then\u00a0pulls out a key\u00a0twig and the entire dam breaks apart. Applejack thanks Fluttershy for her help before Rainbow Dash appears to retrieve the two \"slackers\".\n At first, Fluttershy is hesitant to accept such a task as great as reforming Discord, but Celestia's trust in her gives Fluttershy some confidence. The princess takes her leave for Canterlot and leaves the rest to Twilight and her friends. They harness the power of the Elements of Harmony to set Discord free, and upon awakening, Discord wastes no time in transforming nearby woodland creatures with his magic, playing it off as stretching. He reveals that he was consciously aware during his imprisonment and laughs off the idea of being reformed, especially the ponies' faith in Fluttershy, considering he is impervious to her \"Stare\". But Twilight makes clear the conditions of Discord's freedom: behave, or it's back to being frozen in stone. Discord relents to these conditions, but not before entrancing a group of beavers behind the ponies' backs, and resigns himself to crashing at Fluttershy's cottage for the duration of his rehabilitation.\nFluttershy tidies up around her cottage to make it hospitable for her new house guest. Angel Bunny immediately expresses resentment toward Discord's presence. Despite the rabbit's grumbling and the disapproving glares of Fluttershy's friends, Discord has quickly made himself comfortable. None of the ponies (except Fluttershy) believe a word he says to defend himself and take their leave of the cottage. Twilight speaks with Fluttershy one last time before leaving: Fluttershy believes the key to reforming Discord is to become his friend. Twilight has her doubts, but otherwise trusts in Fluttershy's judgment and assures that she and the others will be ready with the Elements if they're needed outside.\nRainbow Dash convinces the others that they'll need a backup plan if (and when) Fluttershy's plan of befriending Discord doesn't work, and Twilight has just the plan in mind.\nAfter briefly addressing Discord's act of eating paper, Fluttershy excuses herself from the house and tells him to make himself at home. Once she's left, Discord reveals to Angel that he's indeed deceiving Fluttershy and relishes in this fact, all while harassing and frightening the poor bunny. Meanwhile, at the library, Twilight looks through book after book in search of a reforming spell, but she finds that all the pages pertaining to such a spell have been torn out, which explains the paper Discord was eating earlier.\n Fluttershy returns home to find that her cottage has been literally turned upside-down, set in a slow rotation above\u00a0the ground, but having told Discord to make himself at home, she allows it as long as it makes him comfortable. Discord comments on Fluttershy's boundless kindness, regards the rest of her friends as \"nasty\" and tricks her into thinking her efforts at reforming him are beginning to work. Twilight and Spike arrive, and Fluttershy tells them that\u00a0they're making progress. Naturally, Twilight and Spike are skeptical. When they inform her that all the reforming spells in the library were torn out, Fluttershy mentions Discord's earlier paper-eating (to Twilight's absolute horror) but says that there's no need for such a spell. To prove this, she tells Twilight to bring their friends to the cottage that evening for a dinner party.\nTwilight and Spike arrive at the cottage with the rest of the ponies, still wearing the Elements of Harmony. Discord greets them at the door and welcomes them inside. In contrast to how it appeared earlier, the inside of the cottage is decorated lavishly, with a large dinner table, cushions, and a chandelier. Twilight instructs her friends to not let their guards down.\n The dinner party goes about as well as one would expect a dinner party hosted by the spirit of chaos would: kitchen and tableware spring to life and spray everypony with hot gravy and soup. Rainbow Dash has reached her limit and outs Discord as the mischief maker he is and always will be. Fluttershy calls out her friends for not giving Discord a chance; when asked why she was going to such lengths, she says it's because that's what friends do.\nThe idea of being Fluttershy's friend makes Discord pause; he's never had a true friend before. Then Angel suddenly bursts in and, through a bout of charades, informs the ponies that Sweet Apple Acres is being flooded. Rainbow Dash points to Discord as the cause, and she and her friends leave to see to it, leaving him and Fluttershy behind.\n Sweet Apple Acres is completely flooded by the time Twilight and the others arrive;\u00a0Big McIntosh, Apple Bloom, and Granny Smith are floating in\u00a0large wooden tubs\u00a0and salvaging whatever amount of apples they can, and the beavers that Discord entranced earlier have constructed large, multiple dams across all the streams crossing the farm. Fluttershy attempts to talk to the beavers but with no success. Rainbow Dash asks if she knows this is all Discord's work,\u00a0but\u00a0she\u00a0retorts that of course she's known all along: do they take her\u00a0to be\u00a0a silly, gullible fool?\u00a0 Her entire aim\u00a0is to befriend him any way she can, so he in turn would come to trust and listen to her. \u00a0As is his way, Discord revels in the chaos that he's created. Deciding that now is the time to see if she was right, Fluttershy tells him to fix it, and Discord agrees to comply - on the condition that Fluttershy never use the Element of Kindness against him, as a \"sign of [their] friendship\". Much to her friends' shock, Fluttershy agrees.\nInstead of keeping to his word, Discord proceeds to freeze over Sweet Apple Acres into an ice- and snow-covered\u00a0landscape, believing he's won. Fluttershy becomes visibly angry by this deception, but she abides by her promise not to use the Element of Kindness, accepting a set of ice skates Discord conjured up. Discord wallows in his apparent victory, taking advantage of Fluttershy's friendship, and his freedom before Fluttershy announces she is not Discord's friend, throwing the skates down\u00a0and away onto the ice. Discord shrugs off her anger, taunting over her as she walks away.\u00a0 He asks if she truly believed that she could \"boss him around\" as he puts it, do what she asked because she asked, or that he even cares that\u00a0he'll lose his first and only friend.\n But then, Discord has an epiphany: as\u00a0he looks over at the abandoned skates he gave her, he finally understands the consequences of his actions - and\u00a0realizes that he\u00a0actually does value her friendship. Feeling ashamed and with his eyes welling up with tears,\u00a0Discord reverses all he has\u00a0created in a burst of light and returns Sweet Apple Acres to normal. Discord comes before the returned Princess Celestia and with a bow, officially announces to her that he's willing to use his powers for the forces of good, adding a glum \"most of the time\" under his breath. Celestia congratulates the ponies on a job well done, but she leaves the Elements of Harmony with Twilight just in case. Twilight comments on how the princess was right about Fluttershy all along: that she would be the one to find a way to reform Discord. Treating Discord as a friend made him realize how important friendship was to him, and once he had it, he didn't want to lose it. After some encouragement from his friend, Discord states (very quickly) \"Friendship is magic.\" Fluttershy claims that Discord can be a real sweetheart underneath. However, the others give expressions of uncertainty.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode opens in Golden Oak Library, on a gallery of pictures of Spike\u00a0and Peewee, the phoenix that Spike hatched in Dragon Quest, showing Peewee being returned to his parents. Spike himself is seen baking a jewel cake as Owlowiscious watches. He prepares to mix jewels into the cake batter, but ends up inadvertently eating them. Upon realizing that all the jewels are gone, he blames Owlowiscious. The owl shows Spike his reflection in a spoon, and Spike notices jewel dust on his lips. He shouts in despair before noticing one last jewel on the floor. He intends to mix it into the batter, but ends up eating it as well. Spike shouts in despair once more as Owlowiscious rolls his eyes.\nAs Spike despairs over his having no jewels (and thus no cake), there's a knock at the door; it's Fluttershy and Angel. Fluttershy is here to ask Spike for a favor since she and her friends are expected in the Crystal Empire the following day to help welcome the Head of the Equestria Games. Spike knows all about this and reminds Fluttershy that he wasn't invited. Fluttershy feels guilty over this and prepares to leave, saying that all she had to offer Spike in consolation was a jewel - a rather large jewel, Spike points out. Spike agrees to do Fluttershy's favor (even if it means looking after Angel), and Fluttershy thanks him before leaving. As Spike eyes the jewel Fluttershy gave him, he thinks to himself: Fluttershy isn't the only one whose pet might need looking after.\n After a bit of sweet-talking and (in Pinkie Pie's case) silliness-dodging, Spike gets Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Pinkie Pie, and Applejack to agree to letting him look after their pets as well, with some jewels as compensation. When they stop by the next morning to drop their pets off at the library, Twilight Sparkle even lets Spike watch over Owlowiscious. Some warm goodbyes are exchanged between pet and owner, and the six friends leave to board the train. Twilight expresses concern that Spike might not be able to handle taking care of six animals by himself, but he assures her that he has it under control. Twilight says goodbye and leaves. Spike closes the library door, and the six pets proceed to make a mess of everything.\nWhen Spike regains consciousness after Tank accidentally knocks him out, he finds the library in complete chaos: Winona is chasing Angel around in circles, Gummy is ruining Twilight's books, Opalescence is ripping up the curtains, and Tank inadvertently catapults Owlowiscious across the room. Spike attempts to enforce some order. He manages to get Winona, Tank, Owlowiscious, Opal, and Gummy in a row, but Angel has taken off outside the library.\nWith Winona's help, Spike soon tracks the rebellious rabbit to the Cutie Mark Crusaders' clubhouse, where Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo fawn over him. Spike tries to get the Crusaders to look after Angel for him, but the Crusaders have plans to get their cutie marks in skydiving. Spike, the smooth talker he is, convinces them to try and get their cutie marks for bunny-sitting instead. He even gets them to take the rest of the pets off his hands too. But he ends up having to relinquish one of his jewels (the one Rarity gave him) so the Crusaders could buy food and toys for the pets.\n When Spike passes by the clubhouse later that day with fresh baking ingredients, he finds the Cutie Mark Crusaders are having just as much trouble looking after the pets as he was. He's forced to assume responsibility for the pets again, but not before demanding the jewel he gave them. They say they don't have it anymore, as the gem was used to buy an industrial-sized pet dryer. The pets drag Spike all over Ponyville. He crosses paths with Zecora, who believes she has the solution for Spike's misfortune. But the help she offers involves donating one of his jewels to a\u00a0nearby Filly Guide, explaining that there is \"no worse mojo than dragon greed\". Down another jewel and reaching his wit's end, Spike wraps the pets up in ribbon and rolls them across town, having to surrender yet another jewel to Granny Smith to buy her silence.\nAfter freeing himself from Spike's clutches, Angel sneaks aboard the train. Spike attempts to retrieve the bunny, but the train conductor refuses to let all the pets on without a chaperone. Spike sees the Cutie Mark Crusaders on a nearby bridge; he snatches them up and has them act as the pets' chaperones, and the conductor lets them board (in exchange for another jewel). Spike finally catches Angel, but the train has pulled away from the station. Next stop: the Crystal Empire!\nThe Crusaders fail to contain their excitement about seeing the Empire. Once again, the hungry pets have gotten loose; they make a mess of Pony Joe's donut cart, and Spike is forced to relinquish one of his last two jewels to pay for it.\n The train pulls into the station, and the Crusaders want to have a look around. Spike forbids them from leaving the train car, but after a bit of tickle torture with one of Scootaloo's feathers and some backup from Angel, they get past him. Spike chases after Angel and spots Twilight and her friends about to board the Ponyville-bound train. As the Crusaders admire some crystal snow globes in a shop window, Spike sees Angel running toward Fluttershy and gives chase again. Using his last remaining jewel (Fluttershy's large emerald), Spike obstructs Angel's path with a pile of luggage and catches him.\nSpike, the Crusaders, and the pets board the train again, but so have Twilight and her friends, who are right in the adjacent train car. They hide under the seats as the ponies enter to sit down. Angel threatens to give Spike and the others away by kicking Applejack's seat from underneath. Spike admits defeat and tells Angel to do his worst, apologizing for ignoring him, trying to pawn him off on someone else, and not fluffing his tail as promised. He extends this apology to the rest of the pets and faults his own greed. The pets quickly forgive Spike, but his growling stomach almost gives them away. Angel dashes off the train, retrieves the emerald, and force-feeds half of it to Spike to satiate his hunger.\n When the train pulls into Ponyville, Twilight and her friends get off from one end of the train, while Spike, the Crusaders, and the pets get off from the other end, pretending to have come to meet them. Twilight and Fluttershy commend Spike on doing a good job of taking care of their animal friends. Sweetie Belle casually mentions Crystal Empire's snow globes, making Rarity suspicious and nearly blowing their cover, but she states that it was a lucky guess.\nReturning to the library, Spike goes back to making his cake, using the\u00a0half emerald as an ingredient. He inadvertently eats it. In an ironic parallel to how the episode began, he cries out in despair.\n"}, {"summary": "Twilight Sparkle and her friends Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity leave their pets behind with Spike during their trip to the Crystal Empire. They talk about how excited the Crystal Ponies are about hosting the Equestria Games, which Rainbow Dash describes as the \"biggest sporting event in all of Equestria.\" Rainbow Dash says that Cloudsdale should have hosted the Games one year, but Fillydelphia was chosen instead. She is determined that the Crystal Empire host the Games, especially after they lost a thousand years to an evil king's curse. On the train, the friends practice a cheer to perform for the Games Inspector. Twilight is worried because the Inspector is known for \"putting folks through the wringer on her visits.\" Twilight and her friends arrive at the Crystal Empire, which Crystal Ponies are sprucing up for the Inspector's visit. They meet Princess Cadance in a spa, where she is waiting to get her hair done in a traditional ceremonial headdress. The ponies enjoy the spa's services while they wait.\nA messenger arrives to tell Princess Cadance that her mane-stylist has come down with the flu. None of the other hairdressers know how to style the ceremonial headdress, but Rarity offers to attempt the procedure. The messenger adds that the Inspector, Ms. Harshwhinny, will be arriving in fifteen minutes.\n As everyone begins to panic, Twilight calms herself and takes charge of the situation. She tells Rarity to have Cadance back at the castle when the headdress is done, and leads the rest of her friends to the train station, telling them to be on the lookout for a pony with flower print luggage. Rainbow Dash is certain that the Inspector's early arrival is part of a plan to \"psych [them] out.\"\nA green-maned mare carrying a floral print bag steps off the train. Believing her to be the Games Inspector, Twilight and her friends welcome her. She warms up to them, and is thrilled by the fact that Princess Cadance organized such a welcome for her. As they head to the castle, a formally-dressed pony carrying a floral print bag waits impatiently on the train platform.\nAt the spa, Rarity discovers that skipping a step in the headdress preparation, which she did to save time, has messed up Cadance's mane.\n Meanwhile, Twilight and her friends show the Inspector the castle. The Inspector seems to be both claustrophobic and altocelarophobic.[note 1] She is eager to go outside and stretch her legs, but not before Twilight and her friends perform their elaborate cheer to properly welcome the Inspector to the Crystal Empire. She applauds and is surprised that Princess Cadance even knows her. Twilight's friends decide to show the Inspector around the castle, even though they've hardly explored the castle themselves. Twilight goes to check on Cadance. On her way to the spa, she passes by the formally-dressed pony, who is splashed with mud when a cart passes by. Twilight arrives at the spa, but Rarity won't let her see Cadance because she needs more time to fix her huge mistake.\u00a0Back at the castle, Pinkie is showing the Inspector around. Twilight asks Shining Armor to give the Inspector a proper tour. At that moment, the other ponies and the Inspector enter the stadium, and the Inspector is so overjoyed to be outdoors that she runs around the track. She is thrilled to meet Prince Shining Armor, and says she is thoroughly enjoying her \"vacation\". To their horror, the ponies find out that she is Ms. Peachbottom, not Ms. Harshwhinny.\n Twilight and her friends dash to the train station, but Ms. Harshwhinny isn't there. Meanwhile, Ms. Harshwhinny is having a hooficure and Ms. Peachbottom is getting a massage in the spa. Ms. Harshwhinny complains that she was neglected all day. When Ms. Peachbottom starts to tell her about her wonderful visit, Twilight and her friends rush in. Rarity shows them Cadance, her mane fixed and ceremonial headdress complete.\nMs. Harshwhinny walks over and tells Cadance there wasn't a welcome for her at all. Rainbow Dash confesses to the princess that they welcomed the wrong pony. However, Ms. Harshwhinny changes her mind when Ms. Peachbottom tells her about the warm reception that Twilight and her friends gave her.\n\nThe Crystal Ponies' exhilaration super-charges the Crystal Heart, and it shoots a beam of light into the sky that bursts into an aurora of colors. As Twilight and her friends wait for the train back to Ponyville, Rainbow Dash basks in the satisfaction of helping the Crystal Empire win the competition and says she looks forward to coming back to watch the Games. Just before Fluttershy boards the train, she sees a cart of luggage fall over as a green jewel flies by.\nRainbow Dash feels sorry that Spike had to miss out on everything, but Twilight is sure that he's having plenty of fun taking care of their pets back home. Applejack hears something growling and asks her friends if they can hear it as well.\nThe camera pans down to show Spike, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and the six pets hiding nervously under the seats, revealing the climax of the events in Just for Sidekicks.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Twilight Sparkle awakening to a bright and sunny Ponyville day, singing that she's certain today is going to be perfect. During her song, she wakes up Spike (who goes right back to sleep) and passes by numerous ponies around town, including the Quills and Sofas store owner, who previously appeared in Owl's Well That Ends Well. As her song reaches its climax, Twilight is suddenly interrupted by a splash of rainwater. She immediately accuses Rainbow Dash for the rain but instead finds Rarity on a nearby bridge attempting to manipulate the rainclouds; and to Twilight's shock, Rarity has Rainbow Dash's cutie mark.\nTwilight questions Rarity about why (or even how) she's controlling the weather and what happened to her cutie mark. Rarity doesn't know what Twilight is talking about. She explains that she is simply doing what she's done since the day her cutie mark first appeared. Rarity's \"quilt\" of clouds causes it to rain and snow simultaneously in Ponyville, earning her the irritation of the town's residents.\nTwilight and a very sleepy Spike go to Fluttershy's cottage (which, according to Rarity, is actually Rainbow Dash's cottage) to find out what's going on. They find a sullen Rainbow Dash inside and open the cottage door to the sight of dozens of woodland animals running amok. What's more, Rainbow Dash has Fluttershy's cutie mark. Twilight finds Fluttershy at Sugarcube Corner with Pinkie Pie's cutie mark, trying to make ponies laugh. Pinkie Pie, wearing Applejack's mark, is trying her best to manage Sweet Apple Acres, and Applejack (with Rarity's mark) is at Carousel Boutique trying to make dresses. Each of Twilight's friends fail miserably at their new tasks and are clearly unhappy, but they sing that they are just doing what their cutie mark is telling them to do, that it's their destiny to do so.\nTwilight and Spike frantically return to Golden Oak Library as Twilight realizes what must have happened: The night before, Princess Celestia had sent her Star Swirl the Bearded's spell book (seen at the end of The Crystal Empire - Part 2). The last page in the book contains Star Swirl's secret, unfinished masterpiece, and Celestia had tasked Twilight with making sense of the spell, believing she is the only pony capable of doing so. She had started by reading the spell aloud:\nAs she did so, she inadvertently cast the spell on the nearby Elements of Harmony, causing them all (aside from Twilight's) to change colors. Twilight deduces that this caused her friends' cutie marks to be swapped around as well. Spike suggests casting a counter spell, but there is none. He then suggests her memory-fixing spell from when Discord was freed the first time. Twilight explains that it isn't her friends' memories that have been altered but their true selves. And Zecora's cure for the cutie pox wouldn't help either. Realizing their dead-end situation, Spike reasons that maybe their friends will grow to like their new lives, but Twilight truly doubts it, accepting blame for her friends' misery.\n Twilight goes up to her room and laments over her terrible mistake and how much misery she's brought to both her friends and to Ponyville. Spike consoles her, saying he's sure she'll find a way to help her friends and fix everything. Reassured, Twilight looks at a photograph of her with her friends.\n\nSuddenly, Twilight starts to glow, and she gets an idea: if she can't remind her friends of who they are, she'll remind them of what they mean to each other. She puts the element of magic on and places the rest of the Elements in their chest, then heads out with Spike.Twilight and Spike find Fluttershy in front of the Twinkling Balloon. Disappointed by her failure to make anyone laugh, she decides to move back to Cloudsdale. Before she does, Twilight asks her if she could help Rainbow Dash with the animals. Fluttershy is very unsure, but she is willing to do whatever she can to help her true friend.\nBack at the cottage, the situation is even worse than before: Rainbow Dash is tied up in a pot, with the animals dancing around her. Fluttershy asks Twilight for a spell, but Twilight refuses and tells her to handle the animals. Fluttershy steps in to feed the woodland creatures, and they instantly calm down and warm up to her. She begins to glow, realizing that this is what she's meant to do, that this is her destiny. Twilight then places the element of kindness on Fluttershy. In a burst of comprehension, Fluttershy finally remembers who she is, and her cutie mark returns to normal.\nOne by one, Twilight restores the memories and identities of each of her friends by reintroducing them to their correct roles, with the help of her restored friends and the Elements of Harmony: Rainbow Dash helps Rarity clear the weather, Rarity helps Applejack make dresses, Applejack helps Pinkie Pie save Sweet Apple Acres, and Pinkie brings smiles back to everyone in Ponyville.With her friends restored to their true selves, Twilight has another epiphany: She knows how to complete Star Swirl's spell! She and her friends return to the library, and Twilight rewrites the spell's incantation:\nHaving completed the spell, the Elements of Harmony spark to life, bathing Twilight in their light. She suddenly vanishes into thin air, leaving a scorch mark on the wood floor in the shape and pattern of her cutie mark.\nTwilight appears in a strange, ethereal space\u00a0full of stars and nebulae. Princess Celestia appears before her, congratulating her on creating a brand new form of magic, accomplishing something even Star Swirl the Bearded couldn't, since he didn't understand friendship the way Twilight does. She leads her student down a pathway of stars as dozens of images float by, depicting key moments in Twilight's life and study of magic and friendship. Celestia sings of how proud she is of her student, and that she is now ready to fulfill her destiny.Suddenly, a shifting blob of magenta energy emerges from Twilight's chest and begins to swirl around her while a pulsing white light grows from her very center. Twilight is lifted into the air, the whirls of magenta and white blanket her, and she disappears in a brilliant flash, like the supernova of a star.\nIn the night sky over Ponyville, a variation of Twilight's cutie mark (sporting six small white stars instead of five) appears and floats down to the ground. Twilight's friends watch as the light fades away and Twilight appears, now a little taller[25] and with a pair of feathered wings.\n As the others gather around to marvel at Twilight's new look, Rarity states that Twilight has become an Alicorn, with Fluttershy commenting that she looks just like a princess. Princess Celestia appears and states that Twilight is a princess, explaining that since arriving in Ponyville, she's displayed the charity, compassion, devotion, integrity, optimism, and leadership that a true princess is known for. Twilight worries that this means she won't be Celestia's student anymore. Princess Celestia says she'll still be there to help and guide her, but Twilight has just as much to teach now as she has to learn. Twilight's friends and Celestia then bow to her.\nThe next day, a princess coronation ceremony is held in Canterlot, which Princesses Celestia, Luna, and Cadance preside over. Celestia addresses the assembly of ponies, saying Twilight has proven without a doubt that she is prepared to be crowned Equestria's newest princess.\n The audience beholds Twilight as she and her royal procession enter the throne room. Before the three other Princesses, she is crowned with a new version of the element of magic tiara.[26] On the castle balcony, Twilight waves to a crowd of hundreds of cheering ponies. Princess Celestia prompts her to say a few words.\nIn her first official address as princess, Twilight says friendship was at one time something she didn't care much about, but she wouldn't be standing there if it weren't for the friendships she's made. She expresses to her friends her undying gratitude, and considers herself the luckiest pony in Equestria. It's an emotional day for all, even Shining Armor, who Twilight is surprised to find crying. Twilight's friends congratulate her, and she meets the five of them in a group hug.\nIn a\u00a0reprise of the episode's first song, the newly crowned Princess Twilight Sparkle is brought out of the castle in\u00a0her own chariot before she jumps out to trot and sing alongside her friends.\u00a0Ponies line the city streets to witness the coronation parade, including Derpy, Cloudchaser, and Flitter. In a final shot of Canterlot, Twilight takes flight on her new wings and soars at the screen, proclaiming everything's going to be just fine."}]}, {"season": "4", "eps": [{"summary": " In Canterlot, Twilight Sparkle practices flying while Spike and her friends Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity cheer her on, with Rainbow Dash giving her pointers. However she is still unused to fine wing control, causing her to flap them out of sync, lose control, and crash. She isn't prepared for her performance in the Summer Sun Celebration, which is only two days away. As Applejack helps her up, she calls her \"Princess Twilight\", which Twilight points out is unnecessary. Rarity questions why she insists on that as she has already given up on wearing her crown all the time, and she should at least embrace her royal title. Twilight concedes that if other ponies want to address her that way it's fine, but it feels wrong for her own friends to do so. Rainbow has her run through her performance's big finish, and Twilight has no problem soaring, but her coordination falls apart after smashing through three clouds, loops out of control, and plows a furrow into the ground.\nIn the throne room, Twilight's friends admire the new stain glass window commemorating Twilight's ascension and coronation, along with Star Swirl the Bearded's spell book and a purple book with her cutie mark on the cover underneath. Twilight feels downcast that her friends won't be in Canterlot for the official Summer Sun Celebration, as it was the celebration that brought them all together. It doesn't feel right to any of them that they won't be spending their special day with Twilight in Canterlot, but Mayor Mare was desperate for Twilight's friends to help set up the local celebration for Ponyville. Applejack states that while the celebration is what brought them all together, she points to the stain glass window depicting the six defeating Nightmare Moon (from The Return of Harmony Part 1) as proof that they will always be united by the Elements of Harmony. Twilight and Spike see them off at the train station and they Pinkie Promise to write her as much detail as possible so it'll be like she's there with them, while Rarity reminds Twilight that the two have an appointment after the celebration to discuss royal upgrades to her bedroom loft d\u00e9cor in the Golden Oak Library. However, even as the train pulls away, Twilight tells Spike that she still can't help feeling like she's already missing something.\n That evening in their castle guest quarters, Spike goes over a checklist and noting that they are way ahead of schedule, suggests that they have time to make a quick trip to Ponyville, then return to finish off the checklist before the celebration. Twilight decides to stay in Canterlot in case something goes wrong that requires her attention; this being her first royal duty, she doesn't want to let down her old teacher. Princess Celestia enters the room and says that she is actually looking forward to the celebration for the first time. Looking out the window as Princess Luna raises the moon from a tower balcony, she explains that to her subjects, the holiday celebrated her victory over Nightmare Moon, but to her, it was always a painful reminder that she had to banish her beloved sister to the moon. She then brightens up, stating that it now reminds her of Luna's transformation back and the happy reunion with her. Celestia is happy to have Twilight as part of the festivities, but knows it must have been hard to have her friends return home without her. While no longer teacher and student, Celestia reaffirms that she will always be there if Twilight needs her, just as she hopes that Twilight will be there for her. After sharing a nuzzle, Celestia leaves Twilight and Spike to go over the checklist one more time. As she walks down the corridor, a black root breaks through the floor and pursues her off-screen. All that is heard is Celestia's startled gasp and a short cry of alarm.\n The next morning, both the sun and the moon are in the sky, splitting the sky into half day and half night. Two Unicorn royal guards anxiously take Twilight and Spike behind the closed doors of the throne room and inform her that both Princess Celestia and Princess Luna are missing; they've mysteriously vanished. As the only princess available, they can only take orders from her. Twilight pulls herself together and instructs the two to continue the search and to immediately let her know of anything they find. Another guard bursts in with news from Ponyville: the Everfree Forest is invading!\n The scene cuts to Fluttershy's cottage, where Fluttershy is comforting a crowd of frightened animals. Fluttershy sees black thorny vines creeping out of the nearby Everfree Forest, and is terrified herself.\nAt Sweet Apple Acres, Applejack, Apple Bloom, Big McIntosh, and Granny Smith are trying to remove \"weeds\" without success. Applejack says she has never seen this type of \"weed\" before. A few spiky dark clouds pass by overhead.\nThe roots and vines spread to Ponyville's town center, where Rainbow Dash is unsuccessfully trying to bust the spiky dark clouds. A group of clouds scare her off with lightning.\n At Carousel Boutique, Rarity does not notice the vines until they emit magic that takes control of her horn and the teapot she is levitating. The teapot pours tea onto a hat and chases Opalescence. Rarity puts out the vines' magic and wonders if Sweetie Belle and her friends are pulling a prank. Sweetie Belle bounces down the stairs on her head, affected by the strange magic as well. The magic takes control of a sheet, which chases the siblings. Twilight hurries off in the direction of Canterlot's train station, but Spike reminds her of a faster way to Ponyville: her new Alicorn wings. A bit sheepishly, she puts Spike on her back and makes an unsteady but successful lift off. They reach Ponyville airspace as the vine invasion grows worse, barely avoiding several of the spiked clouds. She realizes she is flying too fast for her limited experience to land safely at Golden Oak Library, so she teleports herself inside, leaving Spike to smack into a window.\nTwilight's friends tell her about the Everfree Forest, just as a large root breaks through a window. Twilight explains that Princess Celestia and Princess Luna are missing, and gives her friends their Elements of Harmony necklaces. Applejack tells Twilight that the Elements of Harmony will always keep the friends together. Applejack asks who they may be firing on, and Twilight comes to the conclusion that there's a bit too much chaos going on to just be a coincidence.\n The friends head for a clear spot outside, stand in a circle and use the Elements of Harmony to summon Discord, who is taking a shower and singing Winter Wrap Up. Discord is not upset in the least, but he does remind Twilight that Celestia had told her that she is to give him a heads up before a summoning. Twilight demands that he immediately release Celestia and Luna and halt the Everfree Forest's invasion. Discord denies causing the mayhem and claims to be reformed.\nFluttershy convinces Rarity, Applejack, and Rainbow Dash that they shouldn't turn Discord back to stone because he may be telling the truth. Discord thanks \"Shutterfly\" while hugging Rainbow Dash, causing Fluttershy to correct him. Twilight asks Discord to help them find out who caused the princesses to disappear and the Everfree Forest to grow, but after showing disapproval of the way he was treated, he directs them to Zecora instead.\n Zecora emerges from the forest with as many possessions that she could bring with her and explains\u00a0that the growth of the forest is too much to handle, even for her, and she was forced to evacuate her house. Applejack asks her why it is growing so violently, but Zecora does not know why. Nevertheless, she pulls out a purple potion from her belongings and claims that it can help. However, it may only be activated by Alicorn magic. She tells Twilight to turn the potion from purple to white, and after a sip, she may be able to see why the sky is day and night.\nTwilight turns the potion white with dark magic. She takes a sip and her eyes turn white. She finds herself in a hall in front of two thrones. As Princess Luna walks out from behind the blue throne, Twilight asks her where they are and why she and Celestia disappeared. Luna says, with great hostility, that she is not going to sit \"idly by\" while the rest of Equestria basks in Celestia's \"precious light.\" She then exclaims\u00a0that there will be only one princess in Equestria, and that princess will be her.\n Luna breaks down the wall behind her and raises the\u00a0moon in front of the sun, causing a solar eclipse. The eclipse's shadow envelops her, transforming her into Nightmare Moon, the antagonist of the season one premiere. As she cackles, the shot zooms in on Twilight,\u00a0who is in\u00a0disbelief of what she has just seen."}, {"summary": " After a short recap of Part 1, the episode continues with Nightmare Moon's menacing, echoing laughter, and she begins destroying the throne room with her magic. As Twilight Sparkle dives out of the way of falling debris, Princess Celestia enters to survey the damage. Twilight comes between Celestia and Nightmare Moon, addressing her as \"Luna\" and telling her to stop before she is banished to the moon again. Celestia, not even acknowledging Twilight's presence, tells Nightmare Moon to lower the moon, as is her duty. Nightmare Moon proclaims that her only duty now is to destroy her sister Celestia.\nNightmare Moon attacks and chases Celestia into the sky, prompting Twilight to follow. After several moments of dodging Nightmare Moon's magic, Celestia is hit squarely in the chest.\u00a0Screaming, she plummets\u00a0to the throne room floor. As Nightmare Moon cackles above, Twilight cries over the fallen Celestia and wonders why Princess Luna would do such a thing, not realizing she is in the past. As Twilight sobs, Celestia recovers and gets back up (to Twilight's great relief). Still not acknowledging Twilight's presence, Celestia raises the Elements of Harmony as they appeared in the past, up from underneath the floor. Twilight realizes that what she is witnessing is the night\u00a0in which\u00a0Princess Luna was first banished.\n Princess Celestia levitates the Elements, and they form a ring around her. Flying back up, she hovers across from Nightmare Moon. With tears streaming from her eyes, Celestia blasts Nightmare Moon with the Elements of Harmony. Nightmare Moon fires back with her own magic, but the Elements and Celestia's magic combined prove far more powerful; she is engulfed in a rainbow of light and blasted to the moon, creating the Mare in the Moon's image on the moon's surface.The magic of Zecora's potion wears off, and the light from Twilight's eyes fades, bringing her back to present day Ponyville. She wonders why her friends are all staring at her, and they tell her that she was mumbling to herself and crying, which Discord found amusing. Rainbow Dash asks if Twilight knows who's responsible for the Everfree Forest's invasion, but Twilight has no answer. Zecora believes the answer lies further in the past and suggests another sip of the potion. Twilight does just that, and Discord stands ready with a video camera and tripod.\n Light fills Twilight's eyes again, and she has another flashback, this time to Discord's first reign of chaos. Discord sits in his self-made throne as Princesses Celestia and Luna approach. As Discord helps himself to what appear to be seeds and scatters them all around him, Celestia and Luna ready the Elements of Harmony. Discord sits curious as to what they're up to, and the princesses harness the magic of the Elements; Discord can only laugh all the way up to his imprisonment in stone.\nThe flashback suddenly takes Twilight even further into the past, and she finds herself deep within the Everfree Forest before a tree made of crystal. Twilight sees Celestia and Luna approach the tree, referring to it as the Tree of Harmony. Twilight sees Celestia's, Luna's, and her own cutie mark in the tree's trunk.\n Luna is unsure about what they're about to do, but Celestia states that the Elements are the only means of defeating Discord and freeing Equestria. She goes on to say that the Tree of Harmony possesses a powerful magic even without the Elements, and as long as that magic remains, it will continue to control and contain all that grows in the forest.\nThe flashback ends, and Twilight believes that the Everfree Forest is growing out of control because the Tree of Harmony is in danger. Resolving to save the tree, Twilight and her friends set forth into the forest.\n As Twilight attempts to cross a bubbly creek, she accidentally disturbs a sleeping cragadile. The angry beast advances on Twilight, who's unable to fly away. Twilight's friends restrain the cragadile with black vines, and Twilight berates herself for her helplessness.\nWith no clue as to what will come after them next, Applejack proposes that Twilight returns to Ponyville while the rest of them search for the Tree of Harmony. Twilight objects to such a suggestion, but her friends explain that, with Celestia and Luna gone, Equestria can't afford losing another princess, as there's no guarantee that Celestia and Luna will return when the Tree of Harmony is saved. Her friends all in agreement, Twilight pitifully makes her way back to Ponyville, and Spike follows her.\n Discord is seen enjoying the chaos that the Everfree Forest is causing and using Gummy as a nail file, up until Twilight arrives to scold him. He asks about the Tree of Harmony, and Twilight tells of her friends' decision to have her stay behind. Discord is surprised that Twilight agreed to such a plan, accusing her of keeping herself out of harm's way while her friends rush headlong into danger. The draconequus' words get to Twilight, and she races back to help her friends in the forest.Meanwhile, Twilight's friends have yet to find the Tree of Harmony, and Rainbow Dash thinks their search is a lost cause. As she starts to question whether the tree is real or not, they find a cave at the bottom of a ravine from which bright light and a tangle of black vines emanate.\n Twilight and Spike find themselves lost in the forest. Spike climbs to the top of a tree and spots their friends in the distance. When he alerts Twilight, he sees her surrounded by gas-spewing plants.\nThe others find the Tree of Harmony completely wrapped in thorny vines; Fluttershy believes the tree is dying. They try to rid the tree of the vines, but the vines fight back. The friends try to come up with a solution, during which Applejack and Rainbow Dash get into an argument about sending Twilight away, when Spike arrives, alerting them to the danger Twilight's in.\nTwilight's friends rescue her from the gaseous plants, and Rarity remarks that they're simply lost without her. The friends meet in the middle for a group hug.\nReturning to the Tree of Harmony, Twilight's attempts to get close to it are hindered by the black vines. She remembers Princess Celestia's words about the tree's magic and reaches the conclusion that saving the tree means giving it the Elements of Harmony. Her friends are naturally uncertain, as they won't be able to protect Equestria or turn Discord back to stone if he gets out of their control. Applejack says the Elements keep the six of them connected, but Twilight corrects her: the Elements brought them together, but their friendship will keep them connected.\n With everyone in agreement, Twilight takes the jewels from her friends' necklaces and her crown and gives them to the Tree of Harmony. The resulting surge of magic disintegrates the black vines, and the tree shines bright. The last few vines disintegrate, freeing Princess Celestia and Princess Luna. Twilight runs up and hugs them. Celestia then commends Twilight's courage in giving up the Elements of Harmony.\nSuddenly, the magic of the Tree of Harmony causes a flower to sprout at its roots. The flower blooms to reveal a box with six locks, requiring six keys to open. Celestia states she doesn't know where the keys are, but it's a mystery Twilight won't be solving alone.\n As Twilight and her friends emerge from the forest, Discord appears to congratulate them. When he asks about the Elements, they inform him that they're gone. Discord is quick to ponder the possibilities of this, but Fluttershy swiftly warns him to control himself if he wants to remain friends. Applejack wonders why this all happened to begin with, and Discord mentions out loud that the seeds he planted should've sprouted long ago. Twilight asks him what he means, and he gives her Zecora's potion. She drinks it and views the past one more time.\n Prior to his original imprisonment, Discord had planted his \"plunderseeds\" to steal the Tree of Harmony's magic and capture the princesses, but it was only until now that the tree had enough magic to keep the seeds from growing. Twilight berates Discord for withholding this information, but Discord explains it was to teach Twilight a valuable lesson about being a princess.\nAt the Summer Sun Celebration, Princess Luna lowers the moon and Princess Celestia raises the sun. At her cue, Princess Twilight (wearing a new crown) takes flight and produces a sonic rainboom-like effect with her magic in the shape of her cutie mark. Afterward, everyone smiles for Princess Twilight, even her.\n"}, {"summary": " In Golden Oak Library, Twilight Sparkle unsuccessfully tries to find information on the Tree of Harmony's locked chest, previously seen in Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2. Princess Celestia writes to Twilight, suggesting that she should go to the Everfree Forest and look for a book in the library in the royal sisters' old castle.\nIn the dilapidated castle, Twilight and Spike find the large library of ancient books. Twilight is ecstatic to have found such a large source of untapped research material, but Spike trembles in fear as star spiders crawl around him.\n At Sweet Apple Acres, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are locked in a competition of bravery while Pinkie Pie keeps score. They have a staring match while being covered in bees, but it is cut short when a beekeeper pony calls back the bees. Pinkie declares that Applejack and Rainbow Dash are tied for bravest pony and leaves to test the new Ponyville Schoolhouse bell. Applejack decides that they can have a re-match in the Everfree Forest.\nRarity leads Fluttershy and Angel through the forest on a quest to find ancient tapestries in the old castle. Fluttershy is nervous about being in the forest so late in the day, mentioning that it is star spider season. Rarity says that she enlisted Fluttershy's help to bring some of the tapestries back to Carousel Boutique for restoration and possibly inspiration for a new fashion line. They enter the castle. A large unseen figure looms above the castle steps.\nAs Rarity marvels at the foyer's decor, Fluttershy warns Angel of the castle's dangers. The three enter the next chamber just as Twilight and Spike enter from an opposite corridor with a lit candelabra. Twilight intends to stay well into the night researching. As they exit the foyer, Applejack and Rainbow Dash arrive. Applejack says she brought them there because of a legend Granny Smith told her when she was a filly. When Nightmare Moon was banished to the moon, not all of her dark magic went with her, and whenever night falls on the castle, that magic would take the form of a being called the Pony of Shadows. Rainbow Dash is skeptical of the myth.\n Rarity and Fluttershy find a worn tapestry of Princess Luna. Fluttershy flies under the tapestry to take it off the wall, but activates a hidden mechanism that rotates the wall. On the other side of the wall, Applejack and Rainbow Dash see the tapestry moving and hear Fluttershy struggling under it. They run away, screaming in terror when a figure casts a shadow on them. The wall turns back around, and Fluttershy pops out from behind the tapestry with a sprained wing. Realizing that the tapestry is too heavy to take off the wall, they resolve to find a smaller one. Rarity mentions the rotating wall to Fluttershy and concludes that the castle must have an abundance of secret doors and traps. They suddenly fall through a pit when Angel steps on a pressure plate. Angel nervously hops away afterwards.\nApplejack and Rainbow Dash gallop madly through castle corridors, starting to believe that the Pony of Shadows might be real. They decide that whoever stays in the castle the longest wins. Neither notice an eye in a painting on the wall watching after them.\nBack in the library, Twilight and Spike have yet to find anything. Angel's sudden appearance startles Spike, who leans back in his chair. The chair's hidden mechanism opens a reading chamber behind a bookshelf. Inside the chamber, Twilight discovers Celestia and Luna's diary.\nApplejack and Rainbow Dash walk down a spiral staircase and find a hallway lined with torch wall-mounts shaped like pony legs.\n Under the trap door they fell through, Rarity and Fluttershy end up in a small, dark hollow with nothing but a small hole in the wall. Rarity reaches her hoof through the hole, just as Rainbow Dash feels someone put her hoof around her. She thinks it's Applejack, but Applejack is standing several feet away. The wiggling hoof in the wall scares Applejack and Rainbow into fleeing, and Rarity panics over feeling something alive. Thinking it's Angel, Fluttershy reaches through the hole and pulls on one of the torch wall-mounts, causing the wall to spin around and free them. Rarity has reached her wit's end, and Fluttershy is still worried about Angel.\nAs Angel helps himself to a bowl of carrots, Twilight reads about Celestia and Luna's favorite castle traps in their diary, including the \"Hall of Hooves\" and the \"Organ to the Outside\". In a chamber far beneath her and Spike, a cloaked figure plays a pipe organ as Applejack and Rainbow Dash race past. Spike hears the organ playing faintly, but Twilight is too engrossed in her reading.\nFluttershy looks for Angel when Rarity finds a pair of sun and moon-themed tapestries in the throne room. Meanwhile, Applejack and Rainbow Dash wander into a hallway lined with suits of armor.\nThe cloaked figure continues playing the Organ to the Outside. Each note sets off a trap somewhere in the castle. One note separates Applejack and Rainbow Dash. Another causes Rarity to disappear behind Princess Luna's throne, leaving Fluttershy alone. As the cloaked figure plays another note, another bowl of carrots appear in front of Angel. The ponies' frightened screams and the organ's ominous tones fill the castle as Twilight is still too distracted to hear the screams.\n Rarity, Fluttershy, Applejack, and Rainbow Dash meander into the foyer, erupting into screams and sobs when they bump into each other. Twilight finally hears their screams, and she and Spike go to investigate. She finds her friends in hysterics and calms them down. Twilight leads them to the organ room where the cloaked figure is playing the organ. Twilight cautiously approaches and pulls the figure's cloak off, revealing it to be Pinkie.\nWhen asked about her bell ringing duties, Pinkie says she rang the school bell for five minutes by standing inside the bell and banging her head against it, after which she was told that was \"good enough\". She went to the Everfree Forest to gather bluebells for a \"finish ringing the school bell\" party, but felt chilly and had to wrap herself in the tarp she had meant to carry the bluebells in. She then caught sight of Fluttershy and Rarity going into the castle and followed them, because she thought they were heading to an \"everypony come to the scary old castle and hide from each other while I play the organ\" party.\n Back in the secret reading chamber in the library, Twilight explains to her friends that reading the princesses' diary helped ease her fears.\nTwilight suggests that she and her friends keep a collective journal so they can learn from each other and ponies who read it in the future might learn from them.\n\nAs Spike dismisses the idea of shadow ponies, a dark\u00a0figure casts its shadow on the bookshelves in the next room and bares its glowing yellow eyes."}, {"summary": " The episode opens with Fluttershy in a tree, teaching a pair of chicks to fly. Rainbow Dash suddenly swoops in, repeating \"four more months\" in excitement and asking Fluttershy if she is excited as well. Fluttershy admits to being \"a little, kinda, sort of excited\", but does not know what she should be excited about. Rainbow explains that the next Daring Do book is due for release in exactly four months time. She proceeds to imagine at length what the next book will be about and what adventures and dangers Daring Do will face, including the Fortress of Talacon and the series antagonist Ahuizotl.\nIn her over-excitement, Rainbow Dash soars past Fluttershy and straight into the tree. As the pair of chicks flutters around the dizzy Rainbow's head, Fluttershy begins to think Rainbow will not last another four months.\nRainbow Dash bounces her way toward the Golden Oak Library, excited that the release of the next Daring Do book is now three months and twenty-six days away. She enters the library to find Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Rarity, Fluttershy, and Applejack are celebrating \"National Random Holiday Party Day\". Rainbow Dash wonders why no one invited her; Applejack says that she had invited Rainbow personally, but she was too distracted reading a Daring Do book. When Rainbow mentions the upcoming book, Twilight reveals that its release was pushed back by another two months.\n Rainbow Dash starts to panic, unable to wait for the book even longer than before. What's more, she gets slightly frustrated at Twilight for knowing more about the series and its publishing than she does. Twilight reminds Rainbow that she introduced her to the series in the first place, adding that the author of the Daring Do books, A.K. Yearling, is her favorite author and she knows just about everything about her.\nRainbow Dash asks Twilight if she knows where A.K. Yearling lives. She concludes that A.K. Yearling delayed the book due to everyday distractions, and proposes helping the author. Twilight has reservations about violating the author's privacy but slowly comes around to the idea.\n As she and her friends travel to a remote part of Equestria, Twilight is still uneasy about intruding upon A.K. Yearling's privacy. Her unease is interrupted when they come across a cottage in the middle of a forest. The six friends find the residence to be a complete mess and begin to fear for A.K. Yearling's well-being (and Rainbow begins to fear for the status of the next Daring Do book).\nSuddenly, A.K. Yearling herself enters the house, wondering what Twilight and her friends have done to it. The six ponies deny having anything to do with the mess as Yearling starts searching for something. She locates a book with gold binding and a horseshoe on the cover, undoing a sort of lock on it to reveal a large golden ring. Yearling sighs in relief, saying only that \"it's safe\" before tucking the ring into her coat.\n When Rainbow Dash asks about the new Daring Do book, A.K. Yearling ignores her and Twilight pulls her aside, saying that they should respect her privacy. Just then, Pinkie Pie calls attention to the three stallions sneaking into Yearling's house from a second-story window. The stallions confront Yearling inside, and she throws her coat, hat, and glasses at them. The author then dons a pith helmet and outstretches her wings.As Daring Do fends off the stallions and keeps the gold ring away from them, Twilight and her friends watch in awe from outside. Rainbow Dash distracts Daring momentarily when she calls out her name, allowing the stallions to subdue her, and the gold ring falls at the hooves of another stallion\u2014Dr. Caballeron, another adversary of Daring's.\n As Twilight and Rainbow flip out over both Daring Do and Dr. Caballeron being real ponies, Daring presumes that Dr. Caballeron is working with Ahuizotl, who Caballeron intends to sell the ring to. Caballeron and his henchponies take leave of the injured Daring, and the Mane 6 go to help her. Daring Do brushes them off and flies after Caballeron with her leg in a splint.\nWhat follows is a back-and-forth between Twilight and Rainbow Dash about the events of Daring Do's books and whether or not to help her in her current adventure; they conclude that the ring Dr. Caballeron has is the last in a set of rings needed to complete a dark ritual and must be retrieved for safekeeping. Twilight decides that the six of them need a well thought-out plan, but Rainbow Dash soars off before they can make such a plan.\n Rainbow catches up with Daring Do and, after fighting off the sheer elation of meeting her hero, says that she wants to help. Daring Do makes it clear that she works alone; having to deal with secrets all the time, she considers it best not to trust anyone. Rainbow states that just because some can't be trusted doesn't mean no one can be trusted. Despite Daring's attempts to get rid of her, Rainbow Dash is determined to help.When night falls, Rainbow Dash and Daring Do find where Dr. Caballeron and his henchponies have set up camp. Daring Do makes a disguise for herself by squashing her helmet flat and covering her face with leaves to make a beard. With a large bag of bits, she approaches Caballeron and attempts to buy the ring from him. Caballeron prepares to sell, but Ahuizotl suddenly storms onto the scene and demands the ring. Caballeron makes off with the bits and leaves the ring behind.\n Daring Do snatches the ring, revealing herself to Ahuizotl, and he sics his army of jungle cats on her. She fights the animals off while Rainbow Dash watches from the sidelines. Seeing Daring Do's hat on the ground, she picks it up and calls out to her. Her shouting gets Ahuizotl's attention, and he grabs her with his tail. Daring sees Rainbow Dash in danger and is once again distracted long enough for her to be subdued. Ahuizotl tosses Rainbow Dash aside, and he and his cats walk off with Daring Do in ropes. Rainbow once again offers to help, but Daring tells her not to bother, sarcastically saying she's helped plenty already.\nTwilight and the others catch up with a sullen Rainbow Dash, who informs them that Daring Do and the ring have been captured by Ahuizotl. Kicking herself for getting involved when she shouldn't have, Rainbow decides it's time to head home. The others are surprised to see their friend give up on another pony so easily, and Twilight notes that Rainbow put Daring Do on so high a pedestal that she can no longer see her own worth; they wouldn't be who they are if they didn't help.\n Somewhere beneath the Fortress of Talacon, Daring Do is seen restrained to a stone wall and over a pool of piranhas. Before taking leave with the ring, Ahuizotl pulls on a rope lever, causing the chamber to fill with more water. As the piranhas below snap their teeth, Daring Do manages to free her hooves from the wall. Before her weighted restraints pull her down, Rainbow Dash swoops in to her rescue. Once again, Daring asserts that she works alone; Rainbow comments that it's lucky for Daring that she doesn't. In the fortress' central chamber, Ahuizotl prepares to use the ring to complete the ritual when Twilight and her friends appear. They snatch the ring away and fend off the attempts of Ahuizotl's henchponies to retrieve it. As the henchponies chase Twilight and company up and down the chamber, Rainbow Dash and Daring Do sneak toward the altar. At Daring Do's direction, the two remove the rest of the rings from a stone pillar, the removal of which will cause the fortress to collapse. Daring reveals to Rainbow that she'd planned to get herself captured all along so she could get inside the fortress, but she had not accounted for the rings' weight and admits that having help can be handy at times.\nBy the time Ahuizotl retrieves the ring from Twilight and her friends, Rainbow Dash and Daring Do have succeeded in causing the fortress's collapse. The ponies make their escape from the crumbling fortress, and amidst the rubble, Ahuizotl emerges and swears revenge on Daring Do.\nAfter shattering the ring to pieces, Daring Do thanks Rainbow Dash for her help. She extends a hoofshake to Rainbow, but Rainbow suddenly hugs her instead. Once they part, Daring Do leaves to finish her book.\nSome time later, as Rainbow Dash writes her friendship lesson in her friends' journal, a mailpony arrives with a package from A.K. Yearling: an advance copy of the new book, Daring Do and the Ring of Destiny. Rainbow opens the package and is overjoyed to see herself on the front cover alongside with Daring Do.\n"}, {"summary": " At the schoolhouse, Cheerilee informs her class that they have two special guests with an announcement. She introduces the first: Ms. Harshwhinny, the head of the Equestria Games. As she addresses the class about the upcoming Games, the class's second special guest Rainbow Dash arrives, soaring through the classroom's open window. She then tasks the students in the class with coming up with the most spectacular routine, and whoever does will be going to the Games.\nAfter reining in Rainbow Dash's over-enthusiasm, Ms. Harshwhinny elaborates: the foals in the class are to be split into teams. Each team will create a flag-carrying routine that will be judged. Rainbow Dash interrupts to inform the foals that she will be coaching them and that she herself was a flag carrier for the Equestria Games when she was a filly, with flying being a central part of her routine. Harshwhinny warns Rainbow to show professionalism as the students' coach and tells the class that Rainbow will be accompanying the competitors to the Crystal Empire in three days. After offering the students some more words of encouragement, Rainbow Dash takes her leave of the classroom (professionally, of course). Harshwhinny follows suit, but not before giving one more piece of advice: their performance should show the judges what their hometown of Ponyville means to them.\n When the bell rings and school lets out, the fillies and colts all race off to practice their own routines for bearing the flag. Scootaloo, Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom are briefly stumped as to what they are supposed to do before they realize that they represent Ponyville's most distinctive feature: all of the three races of Equestria live there in a harmonious mixed community characterized by friendship. The Crusaders know that conveying such a message through their routine will take hard work and practice, but they are determined; they may be little, but they have hearts as strong as horses.\nSeeing this, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon have no shortage of insults for the Crusaders, ridiculing them for their lack of cutie marks as usual and noting that having \"blank flanks\" represent Ponyville would be unthinkable. But the Crusaders are still determined, and they are not going to lose confidence to being called \"blank flanks.\" They accept Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon's challenge.\n The Crusaders demonstrate to Rainbow Dash a brief performance, demonstrating the main characteristics of the three races and how they live together in harmony in the town. The act concludes with Scootaloo jumping her scooter through a hoop and the three fillies making an inverted pyramid as the town flag rolls past on Scootaloo's now-unmanned scooter. Despite her attempts to stay professional, Rainbow Dash is amazed by this \"work in progress\". She flies off, and the Crusaders continue practicing.\nDiamond Tiara and Silver Spoon, watching from a hiding spot, begrudgingly admit that the Crusaders' chances of winning are good. They decide that their only hope of winning is to disrupt the Crusaders' own preparations, and Diamond Tiara decides that Scootaloo is the weak link they can exploit.\nThe two bullies approach the Crusaders and offer insincere congratulations. Almost immediately, they begin to pour scorn on Scootaloo, implying strongly that she is unfit to represent the Pegasi at the Equestria Games due to her inability to fly. Although the other two Crusaders are dismissive of the bullies' taunts, Scootaloo is deeply disheartened. The flightless filly decides that the only way for them to win is for her to fly; her trouble with getting off the ground gives Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle cause for concern.\n The Crusaders spend the next several hours, well into the evening, trying to rework their performance with Scootaloo flying through the hoop rather than driving her scooter through it. Because of Scootaloo's inability to do more than hover for short periods, this does not work, and Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle are quickly losing their patience (as well as sleep). When the Crusaders show the revised and unremarkable routine to Rainbow Dash the next day, she attempts to be supportive but it is clear that she preferred the act's original version.\nScootaloo is worried about the competition the next day. She is about to voice her next idea to help her fly, but Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle are too tired to continue. They begin to resent the whole routine and accuse Scootaloo of making the performance all about herself. The two call it a day and leave for the day, leaving an increasingly despondent Scootaloo to practice alone. Despite hours of trying, Scootaloo fails to fly and finally gives up.\nThe next morning, the foals of Cheerilee's class are boarding the train to the Crystal Empire, and Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle see that Scootaloo is nowhere to be seen. Scootaloo arrives at the last minute and informs her friends that she won't be going with them, saying that their chances of winning are hindered by her inability to fly. The tension between the three boils over and Apple Bloom loses her temper, telling Scootaloo that if she wants to quit, they don't need her. Scootaloo, deeply upset, is left on the platform as her friends board the train and leave for the flag ceremony auditions.\n On the train, Rainbow Dash talks excitedly with Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle about their upcoming audition. When she hears that Scootaloo stayed in Ponyville and that the other two did nothing to stop her from quitting, she expresses her disappointment in them for leaving their friend behind. Rainbow Dash pulls the emergency brake and urges the two Crusaders to follow her back to Ponyville and get Scootaloo.\nIn her bedroom, a dejected Scootaloo pulls down various athletics-themed posters from the walls, throwing them in a garbage bin along with her scooter. Rainbow Dash enters with Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle, who tell Scootaloo that they still need her for their routine: whether she can fly or not. Drawing focus once again to the fact that she can't fly, Scootaloo reminds Rainbow Dash that she flew when she was a flag carrier. Rainbow tells her it doesn't matter if she can't fly and reminds her and her friends that friendship, between the three of them and between the three races, is the point of their performance. Rainbow Dash adds that whether or not Scootaloo will someday fly, she's already \"all kinds of awesome\".\nEncouraged, the three fillies follow Rainbow Dash from Scootaloo's home, racing through Ponyville, Scootaloo towing the other two Crusaders on skis behind her. They ride through Ponyville, passing by other ponies and Granny Smith, who acknowledges Scootaloo with a high-hoof.\n The Crusaders perform their routine as intended before a packed stadium in the Crystal Empire. Ms. Harshwhinny then announces the winners of the competition and selected flag carriers of the Equestria Games: the Cutie Mark Crusaders, much to the chagrin of Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon. Rainbow Dash coolly congratulates the three, while Ms. Harshwhinny is left astonished by their performance, leaving Rainbow to remind her to conduct herself professionally.\nAs the Crusaders share a laugh, Scootaloo looks at her bare flank. No cutie mark yet appears, but she expresses hope to her friends that they will get their cutie marks in flag carrying.\n"}, {"summary": "Twilight Sparkle is asleep in her bed when she's stirred awake by a lamp switching on. She sees Spike reading a comic book and tells him to go to sleep, but Spike asks for two more minutes. He proceeds to talk at length about the Power Ponies, their sidekick Hum Drum, and the evil Mane-iac. Twilight sympathizes with Spike's investment in a book, but states they'll need to be well-rested to help fix up Princess Celestia and Princess Luna's old castle in the morning. Spike relents and goes to bed, but when Twilight sees him fumbling in the dark for his comic, Twilight allows him two more minutes to read.\n The next morning, Twilight and her friends take part in refurbishing Celestia and Luna's old castle. Spike wishes to pitch in, but the ponies politely decline. Twilight tells him to find someplace quiet to read his comic, and Spike shuffles off, feeling useless.\nSpike goes to Celestia and Luna's reading room to read, sympathizing with the bumbling Hum Drum. When he suddenly reaches the end of the comic, he finds a footnote in small, hard-to-read text. As Twilight and the others take a break from cleaning and come looking for Spike, he uses a magnifying glass to read the footnote:\nThis causes a magic spell in the comic book to come to life, and Spike is sucked inside its pages. Twilight and her friends, in their attempt to save him, get dragged inside as well, except Pinkie who just jumps in after them.\n Spike, now in superhero attire, regains consciousness on the roof of a building in Maretropolis. Behind him, he sees his pony friends in superhero attire as well and recognizes them as the heroes in his comic\u2014the Power Ponies.\nSuddenly, there's an explosion at the museum across the street, and the Mane-iac emerges from the smoke, laughing maniacally and holding an orb surging with electricity. When Applejack and Rainbow Dash wonder what's going on, Spike explains that they were transported into his comic book and that the only way out to defeat the Mane-iac. The Mane-iac attacks the ponies with a pretzel cart and a mailbox; as Pinkie Pie dodges the mailbox, she demonstrates the super speed of her Power Pony persona Fili-Second.\n Applejack tries to wrangle the Mane-iac with her lasso, but it works against her, and she pins herself to a lamppost. Twilight's attempts at using the Masked Matter-Horn's powers fizzle, Rainbow uses Zapp's powers to create a tornado instead of lightning, Rarity's powers as Radiance prove less than helpful, and Fluttershy's anger-based powers as Saddle Rager don't manifest because she's not angry. After watching in amusement, the Mane-iac takes her leave, but not before addressing Spike by his designated role as Hum Drum.\nAfter Spike explains that the lasso Mistress Mare-velous uses is psychically connected to her, Applejack reins in the tornado with Mistress Mare-velous' powers, and Spike once again explains to his friends that the only way out of the comic book world is to stop the Mane-iac from using her doomsday device. While Rainbow Dash is excited about having superpowers, Spike is less than thrilled about being the powerless Hum Drum. Twilight encourages Spike by saying he's not really Hum Drum, but he is still in low spirits.\n Spike leads the Power Ponies to the Mane-iac's headquarters: her shampoo factory. Before Twilight can come up with a plan, Rainbow Dash gives away her and her friends' position by zapping the building with lightning. As Spike stays back, the Mane-iac's henchponies emerge from the factory and attack. Despite Fluttershy's inability to get angry, the Power Ponies subdue and restrain the henchponies.\nWhen the Mane-iac herself appears, she immobilizes the Power Ponies with her \"hairspray ray of doom\". She leaves Hum Drum behind, considering it pointless to use her spray on him. Spike watches helplessly as the Mane-iac and her henchponies take the Power Ponies prisoner.\n Spike sneaks into the factory through an air duct, all the while calling himself useless, and finds his friends still immobilized and inside a big cage. Each time the effect of the spray wears off, one of the henchponies sprays them again.\nThe Mane-iac uses the Electro-Orb to power her hair dryer-shaped cannon, and tells the Power Ponies her plan to use it on them and the citizens of Maretropolis and cause their manes to grow wildly. When Fluttershy reminds her of Hum Drum, the Mane-iac once again dismisses the little guy as useless. The Power Ponies disagree, with Twilight noting that in their world, he always comes through.\n Encouraged by his friends' words of praise, Spike springs into action. As the Mane-iac monologues to the ponies in true villain fashion, Spike ensnares some of the henchponies in a large tarp and immobilizes more with the Mane-iac's hairspray, allowing the Power Ponies to break free. The ponies fight off the rest of the henchponies as the Mane-iac powers up her cannon to shoot Fluttershy who isn't trying to use her powers. When a firefly gets in the Mane-iac's line of fire and she swats it away, Fluttershy loses her temper, and the powers of Saddle Rager finally manifest, turning her into a large, muscular monster.\nThe Mane-iac fires her weapon at Saddle Rager, but its beam bounces back at her, and Saddle Rager smashes the weapon to pieces. The effects of the weapon entrap the Mane-iac in her own mane like a straitjacket. Spike declares the Power Ponies victorious, but doesn't finish his narration before the comic transports him and the ponies away.\n Spike and the others are transported out of the comic book and back into Celestia and Luna's old reading room, returned to normal. As the ponies shake off the excitement of their latest adventure, Pinkie Pie offers the group cupcakes, which she picked up from the Maretropolis Bakery a half-second before their return home. Twilight commends Spike for his heroism, and Spike learns that he doesn't need superpowers to be a super friend.\nWhen Twilight asks where Spike got the comic book, he says he got it in a store in Canterlot that sold \"enchanted\" comic books, not realizing that the comics were magically enchanted as opposed to telling enchanting stories. The ponies and Spike leave the room, and the comic book suddenly vanishes in a flash of white light.\n"}, {"summary": "Applejack awaits the sunrise atop a hill at Sweet Apple Acres. As a rooster crows, Applejack declares it officially Apple Bucking Day. She trots past a few of the apple trees, bucks one, and watches the apples fall, only to find them rotten and mushy. Applejack looks up and sees a colony of bats flying overhead.\nApplejack summons her friends for a \"Sweet Apple Acres code red\" and tells them that vampire fruit bats are swarming the orchards. She's determined to keep the fruit-sucking bats away from her prized blue ribbon apple\u2014a much larger apple that she plans to enter into a competition in Appleloosa. Fluttershy proposes asking the bats nicely to stay away from the apple, but Applejack is skeptical.\n When Fluttershy tries talking with the vampire fruit bats, they spit apple seeds at her. Fluttershy admits that she is unsure of the bats' answer because she has never communicated with vampire bats before. Applejack is unwilling to let the vampire bats claim any more apples, calling them \"nothing but a bunch of monsters\".The rest of Applejack's friends, except Fluttershy, agree to round up the vampire fruit bats. When Fluttershy suggests letting the bats have part of the orchard, Applejack briefly snaps. Fluttershy elaborates that a sanctuary for the bats would give them their own apples to enjoy, and that the seeds they spit out would grow into more productive trees. Applejack is still very hesitant about the idea, as she recalls Granny Smith's stories of the last vampire fruit bat infestation. Thinking for a moment, Twilight formulates an idea to stop the bats from eating apples.\n The friends regroup at the Golden Oak Library, and Twilight says she found a spell that will stop the bats from eating apples, but it requires the use of Fluttershy's Stare. While Fluttershy is reluctant to use it, her friends convince her once she realizes what's at stake.\nBack at Sweet Apple Acres, the Mane Six round up the vampire fruit bats onto a single apple tree, where Fluttershy stares them into submission. When Twilight uses her spell on the bats, they refuse to eat apples afterward. With their mission accomplished, Applejack thanks her friends for their help. As they go to sweep up the rotten apple cores, Fluttershy looks over at an apple.\nThe next day, Applejack is back on the hill for \"take two\" on Apple Bucking Day. A rooster crows, and she sets off to buck apple trees. However, she finds that the apples are still rotten, sucked dry of their juice.\n Applejack rounds up her friends again, with Twilight surprised that the spell didn't work. The friends track down the vampire fruit bats and find that they're still not eating apples\u2014the spell seems to still be working. Twilight asks Fluttershy if any other creature could have done this, but Fluttershy doesn't have an answer. Twilight thus proposes a stakeout to catch the true culprit in the act.\nThat evening, the seven friends walk through the orchards, with Fluttershy remarking of hunger and looking ravenously at the apples. When the ponies split up, they see a figure lurking in the shadows. Applejack signals the others to her location, and to their complete shock, they discover who's been eating the apples: Fluttershy, who's been turned into a vampire pony!\n The ponies try to talk with the transformed Fluttershy\u2014or \"Flutterbat\", as Rarity calls her\u2014but she only hisses at them in response. When they try to make sense of how this happened, Twilight theorizes that, when she cast her spell on the vampire fruit bats, it transferred their desire to be vampire fruit bats into Fluttershy through her Stare. When Flutterbat flies off, Twilight and her friends give chase, but she easily eludes them due to her heightened bat-like senses. Pinkie Pie makes a comment about Fluttershy's Stare, and Twilight comes up with an idea.\nApplejack sacrifices her giant blue ribbon apple to lure Flutterbat into a trap. When she swoops down to eat the apple, Twilight and friends surround her with mirrors, causing her to use the Stare on herself and enter a trance. Twilight casts her spell again, and Fluttershy returns to normal.\nIn the end, Applejack decides to take Fluttershy's advice and sections off a part of the orchard for the vampire fruit bats. She apologizes to Fluttershy for not listening earlier, and Rainbow Dash expresses her excitement for the upcoming cider season.\n Later in Fluttershy's cottage, Applejack and Fluttershy close off their latest journal entry, with Spike's help. Applejack gives Fluttershy an apple as a peace offering, but before she can respond, Pinkie Pie pounces on the apple, pretending to be a fruit-eating vampire-pony.

Rarity is so pleased that her friends will be there with her that, as a token of her appreciation, she gives them tickets to see Hinny of the Hills, the most popular musical on Bridleway.\nWhen the seven friends reach the bustling metropolis, Rarity mentions to her friends that she was able to get tickets to a sold-out musical by doing something nice for the musical's costume designer.\n Rarity is so excited about being in Manehattan that she can't help but sing about it. During the song, she shows generosity to a hotel bellhop, a grumpy stallion in a fedora, and a cabbie pony. Later, Rarity's friends ask if there's anything else they can do. Rarity states that all that's left is for her to check in at the Fashion Week runway plaza by 2:00pm. A quick glance at a clock tower indicates that it's now 1:50pm.\nAs rain starts to fall, a now panicked Rarity tries to hail a taxi. However, there's a long line of ponies all waiting for taxis as well, and none are generous enough to allow Rarity to cut in front. Just then, the cabbie that Rarity had shown generosity to earlier pulls up to give Rarity a lift to the plaza. Her friends soon follow once they realize Rarity had forgotten her dresses.\nRarity enters the plaza to check in for Fashion Week, but discovers she'd forgotten her dresses. As she despairs, the hotel bellhop from earlier wheels her dresses in. After giving another huge tip to the bellhop, Rarity joins her fellow designers onstage just as Prim Hemline, the host and judge of Fashion Week, enters to greet them. She briefly chews out Rarity for arriving only seconds before being late and tells her she'll be displaying her designs last.\nPrim dismisses her and the other designers, and Rarity is greeted by an old acquaintance, Suri Polomare, who's also competing in Fashion Week. She offers Rarity help by moving her dresses backstage and marvels at the dresses' fabric. Mentioning that her own dresses need a little touching-up, Suri asks Rarity for a swatch of the fabric, which Rarity is more than happy to give.\n The next day, when Rarity checks in at the plaza for her run-through with Prim, she discovers that Suri has created an entire line of dresses with Rarity's fabric and passing it off as her own. When Rarity confronts her, Suri\u2014after putting down her assistant Coco Pommel\u2014callously remarks that \"it's everypony for herself in the big city.\" Rarity gallops out of the plaza in tears.Twilight Sparkle and the other ponies return to their Manehattan hotel room after an afternoon of fun, still looking forward to the rest of the day ahead of them, including Hinny of the Hills. When Rarity enters the room in tears, Rainbow Dash asks what's wrong, and Rarity dramatically bawls over how much her generosity backfired on her. Naturally, her friends are all more than willing to help her through her dilemma. Rarity looks at the fabric in the hotel room all around her and is struck by inspiration.\n The ponies thus spend hours sewing and putting together Rarity's new fashion line, and looking quite unhappy doing it. Having already missed their salon appointment and restaurant reservations, the ponies remind Rarity of their plans to see Hinny of the Hills, causing Rarity to snap at them. The ponies feel guilty about \"abandoning\" their friend before quietly going back to sewing. When the dresses are finally finished the next morning, Rarity takes them and heads for the plaza without bothering to thank her friends for their help.\nAt the Fashion Week show, the crowd cheers for Suri Polomare, and Prim Hemline commends her for her unique fabric. As Suri walks offstage and taunts Rarity, Prim presents Rarity's new line, which grabs the crowd's attention in an instant. Rarity is excited that she might actually win, but she notices that her friends are not in the audience and is stricken with remorse over how poorly she'd treated them.\n As Prim expresses her approval over Rarity's dresses, Rarity's eyes flicker with a rainbow-colored aura. She suddenly races out of the plaza and toward the hotel looking for her friends, but the bellhop informs her that they've already left. Thinking they've gone back to Ponyville, Rarity dejectedly walks through a rainy Manehattan, singing about her sorrows.\nRarity returns to the plaza to thank Prim Hemline for her time, but Suri Polomare enters, saying that Prim is furious. Twilight and the ponies then enter; they apologize to Rarity for missing her show because they overslept, and state that they were informed by Suri that Rarity lost. Rarity doesn't care that she lost and apologizes to her friends for how she treated them, and she arranges for the seven of them to see an exclusive showing of Hinny of the Hills.\n As the musical comes to a close, Rarity tells her friends that she was able to arrange an exclusive performance for them by agreeing to make the dresses for the costume designer's next show. When her friends realize this means Rarity will be away from Ponyville for some time, they express sadness but are otherwise happy for her.\nAt that moment, Suri Polomare's assistant Coco Pommel enters the theater. She presents Rarity with the Fashion Week trophy, revealing to her that she had indeed won. Coco explains that Suri lied to Rarity and her friends about her losing in the hope that she would win by default after Rarity's \"forfeit\". Coco herself had gone along with the ruse until she saw the generosity shown between Rarity and her friends, and thus quit her job as Suri's assistant. As a token of gratitude, Coco presents Rarity with a small gift. In return, Rarity gives Coco her position of making dresses for her costume designer friend's next show.\n Rarity and her friends wave goodbye to Coco Pommel at the train station and return to Ponyville. Later, at Carousel Boutique, Rarity writes down the lesson she learned in the friendship journal before opening Coco's parting gift: a spool of rainbow-colored thread.

Pinkie Pie pops in from behind a book on a shelf and wonders what she's doing. Twilight explains she's doing some genealogical research, and Spike specifies to Pinkie that genealogy is the study of one's family history. Interested, Pinkie picks up a scroll and looks through it, making a shocking discovery about who she's related to.\nPinkie Pie knocks on Applejack's door, greeting her with \"Hey, cousin!\"\nThe two friends later bring this news to the attention of Apple Bloom, Big McIntosh, and Granny Smith, who are all equally as excited as Applejack about the development. However, when Applejack takes a closer look at the genealogy scroll, she notices a smudge where it says Auntie Applesauce of the Apple family is a fourth cousin twice removed of the Pie family; whether Applejack and Pinkie Pie are related or not is still unclear. To find out for sure, Granny Smith suggests paying a visit to Goldie Delicious, whose cabin is \"practically an Apple family history museum!\"\nBig McIntosh prepares a wagon for the trip, packing all manner of things on it. With Pinkie Pie away doing her own packing, Applejack gathers her folks around her and asks them to show Pinkie only the positive side of their family. As Pinkie returns with a saddlebag, Applejack briefly pesters Big McIntosh when she asks if all the things he packed are necessary and whether the wagon's strong enough to hold it all.\nUpon setting out for the open road, Pinkie Pie and the Apples sing a light song about family. As soon as the song ends, the wagon collapses. Applejack nearly gets upset with Big Mac about the wagon, but restrains herself with Pinkie nearby. When Apple Bloom and Granny Smith discuss their options, Pinkie Pie suggests turning the family road trip into a family river trip. Without a proper raft (which Applejack mentions is the only thing Big Mac didn't pack), the Apples construct one from the wagon's remains and tree sap. Pinkie Pie also starts taking photographs for a scrapbook. With that, the ponies set off down the river.\nWhen Applejack sees the river splitting off in three different directions, she asks for the map. Apple Bloom fetches it, but quickly loses it when it falls overboard and a fish snatches and makes off with it (and an eagle swoops down to grab said fish). Applejack and Big Mac become annoyed with Apple Bloom for losing the map, but they still force a smile for Pinkie Pie's sake.\nThe wise Granny Smith decides to take the reins, steering the raft down what she believes to be the correct path. Unfortunately, the path leads the raft\u2014and the ponies on it\u2014through the \"scariest cave in Equestria...\"\n\n...causing the Apple siblings to become annoyed with Granny's questionable directions. Applejack attempts to take over steering the raft, and she and Granny Smith get into a light argument. Apple Bloom and Big Mac get dragged into it, and their bickering causes them to lose the raft's steering wheel. As tensions rise among the Apples, Pinkie Pie remains blissfully upbeat and oblivious\u2014just as the raft goes careening over a steep waterfall.With the raft destroyed, Pinkie Pie and the weary Apples trek the rest of the way to Goldie Delicious' cabin on hoof. A note on the cabin's front door states that Goldie is away doing errands. While they wait for Goldie to return, Pinkie goes off to get more scrapbook paper. Applejack, Apple Bloom, Big Mac, and Granny Smith exchange apologies for their behavior during the trip and understand if Pinkie Pie doesn't want to consider herself part of the Apple family. Pinkie Pie returns and, having heard the Apples talking, states that their closeness as a family helped them make amends; knowing that, she wants to be an Apple more than ever.\n\nAt that moment, Goldie Delicious returns from her errands. After Applejack informs her of their situation, Goldie agrees to help solve the mystery. However, when she looks through the record of the Apple family tree, she finds a smudged page. Pinkie is disappointed that the mystery of her genealogy remains unsolved, but Applejack assures her that, after everything they've been through, she's an \"Apple to the core!\" Apple Bloom, Big Mac, and Granny Smith are in complete agreement, and Pinkie Pie meets them for a group hug/photo.With a new wagon courtesy of Goldie Delicious, Pinkie Pie and the Apples return to Ponyville, singing a reprise of their earlier song.\n\nUpon the ponies' return to Sweet Apple Acres, Applejack and Pinkie Pie are about to write about their latest lesson in the friendship journal, but Applejack gets into an argument with Apple Bloom, Big Mac, and Granny Smith over who should write it.

The initial practice ends with Rainbow buried under a pile of Bulk Biceps, Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie after Bulk Biceps runs out of breath mid-flight.\nOn the way to the tryouts in the town of Rainbow Falls, Helia and Thunderlane apologize to Rainbow Dash for not being able to compete in the aerial relay as they are competing in the sprint events; the Games' rules forbid any pony from competing in more than one event. Twilight Sparkle speaks with Rainbow Dash about her less-than-impressive team, Rainbow remarking that she's confident she'll be able to pick up their slack. Their friends are all equally excited about the tryouts for varying reasons.\nRainbow Dash and her friends enter the tryout grounds, where numerous other Pegasi and several griffons are gathered, just in time to watch the Wonderbolts Spitfire, Soarin, and Fleetfoot arrive with their own cheering section. Rainbow Dash coaches her teammates about the qualifiers and attempts to instill some confidence in them, but their coordination pales in comparison to the Cloudsdale team of Wonderbolts. Realizing this, Rainbow Dash's own confidence begins to falter.\nTo help raise the team's spirits, Rainbow Dash has Fluttershy and Bulk Biceps watch Soarin practice for the qualifiers in hopes that they \"learn something.\" During his practice run, Soarin is distracted by a pair of cheerleaders and clips his wing on a hoop, sending himself into a tailspin. Rainbow Dash saves Soarin just before he hits the ground, and he's carted off with an injured wing.\nNow one relay team member short and impressed by Rainbow Dash's flying, Spitfire and Fleetfoot offer the vacant spot on their team to Rainbow Dash since she's originally from Cloudsdale; Fleetfoot quickly adds that it'd only be until Soarin recovers. Rainbow Dash is unsure about practicing with two teams at once\u2014especially behind one team's back\u2014but after a bit more encouragement, she accepts.Rainbow Dash splits her practice times between the Ponyville team and Cloudsdale team, finding that her aerial coordination with Spitfire and Fleetfoot is much better than with Fluttershy and Bulk Biceps.

They tell her that Soarin won't recover in time for the tryouts and offer her a permanent spot on the Cloudsdale team. However, her joining the Cloudsdale team means she won't be able to fly with the Ponyville team. Rainbow Dash is excited about the opportunity, but Twilight informs her of all the ponies she'll let down if she accepts. An uncertain Rainbow Dash asks Twilight what she would do, but Twilight tells her it's a decision she has to make on her own.Later, Rainbow Dash appears on the tryout grounds covered in bandages and bound to a wheelchair. She feigns injury and wails about being unable to fly with either team. Twilight is skeptical of the obvious ruse.\nRainbow Dash is brought to a hospital bed, continuing to fake being hurt. When Fluttershy and Bulk Biceps check in on her, they tell her not to worry about the tryouts, having found a replacement flyer: Derpy. They also promise that, if they qualify for the Equestria Games and win gold medals, they'll give them to her. Rainbow Dash's friends leave to let her rest, and before she joins them, Twilight tells Rainbow that \"choosing not to choose isn't really a decision\".\nIn the adjacent hospital bed, Soarin is envious of Rainbow Dash and her friends, noting that no one's visited him during his stay. When he tells Rainbow that his wing isn't hurt and that he's been benched due to Spitfire and Fleetfoot's concerns, Rainbow realizes both she and Soarin have been lied to. As sunlight enters the room and covers a dropped flag in colors, Rainbow Dash's eyes shimmer with a rainbow-colored aura.Rainbow Dash also confronts Spitfire and Fleetfoot for lying to her about Soarin's wing just to replace him with her\u2014which Soarin is also displeased about.

When Twilight asks where the flower is exactly, Discord offers to show them the way himself, but his being sick would require some arrangements.\n Twilight and Cadance pull Discord on a giant golden chariot, and Cadance admits to being a little out of practice when it comes to flying. When they finally reach their destination, Twilight apologizes to Cadance for their situation. The two climb to the top of a hill and discover that the flower Discord mentioned is towering in size. When they pull it from the ground, a Tatzlwurm emerges from underground and attacks them. They blast the creature with their unicorn magic, drive it back underground, and seal the hole it escaped from with rocks.\nTwilight and Cadance return to Discord with the flower and find him perfectly healthy and dancing. Twilight becomes infuriated over the fact Discord faked being sick, but Discord explains that he thought Twilight wasn't really his friend\u2014she always says she is but has never shown it. He tells Twilight his faking illness was a test of friendship, and the fact that she would travel to the ends of Equestria for his sake means she passed.\nDiscord wonders if his \"test\" put a damper on Twilight and Cadance's quality time.

With two party ponies in one place, Rainbow Dash proposes they work together to make her \"birth-iversary\"\u2014her birthday and the anniversary of when she first moved to Ponyville\u2014epic. Pinkie Pie agrees, and so does Cheese Sandwich, breaking into song and leading the ponies around him in celebration. At the song's climax, Pinkie notices that everyone is more excited about Cheese Sandwich's partying style than hers, outright ignoring her.\nAt Cheese Sandwich's direction, a great birth-iversary bash is organized, complete with a stage. Meanwhile, Pinkie Pie sits alone in front of Sugarcube Corner. When Twilight walks by wondering why Pinkie isn't helping with the party efforts, Pinkie waves off Twilight's concerns, saying Cheese Sandwich has everything handled on his own.\n Pinkie Pie takes a walk through Ponyville and sings of her troubles and identity crisis. Believing that she's been replaced as Ponyville's number-one party planner, she tries her hoof at various other tasks, like surgery, mail delivery, and construction, but performs poorly at all of them. As Pinkie retires her party cannon and other partying supplies and returns home, she sees photographs on her wall of her parties capturing the joy she's brought other ponies through them. With new determination, Pinkie decides to take back her title as premiere party pony and show everyone that she's the \"bestest party pony around\".\nAs Cheese Sandwich puts the finishing touches on Rainbow Dash's party, Pinkie Pie appears and challenges him to a goof off, the winner of which will headline Rainbow Dash's party and be recognized as the ultimate party pony. Confident in his own goofing skills, Cheese accepts the challenge.\nThe ponies of Ponyville gather to watch Pinkie Pie and Cheese Sandwich's showdown, and Twilight explains the rules. Rainbow Dash is selected as the judge of the competition, and Pinkie and Cheese demonstrate their goofing prowess and use every tool in their respective repertoires to make complete clowns of themselves, each attempting to outperform the other.\nWhen a giant pi\u00f1ata falls onto Rainbow Dash, six streamers in the colors of the Mane Six's coats fall, and Pinkie's eyes shimmer with an aura of the same colors. She realizes that Rainbow Dash isn't having fun and that she has broken her Pinkie Party Promise. She calls off the goof-off, forfeiting to Cheese Sandwich.Outside Ponyville, Pinkie Pie packs up her belongings and gets ready to leave. Her friends stop her and apologize for brushing her aside in favor of Cheese Sandwich. Pinkie apologizes in return for letting her pride get in the way of Rainbow Dash's party fun. As she acknowledges Cheese as the superior party pony, Rainbow and the others tell her that, as great of a guest party pony Cheese is, Pinkie Pie is Ponyville's permanent party pony and no one could ever take her place.\n A remorseful Cheese Sandwich then enters and explains he never meant to take Pinkie's place in Ponyville; all he wanted was to show her what a great party pony he was. He confesses that he wasn't always the party pony he is now and that as a colt, he was extremely shy and no one even knew his name. He had stumbled into Ponyville one day during the greatest party he'd ever seen, inspiring him to become a super duper party pony, and the pony who had thrown that party was none other than Pinkie Pie herself.\nAs Pinkie Pie realizes how much of an impact she had on Cheese Sandwich's life, the two patch things up and combine their efforts to make Rainbow Dash's birth-iversary party truly memorable.\n At Rainbow Dash's party, the ponies of Ponyville dance and play games and Cheese Sandwich entertains as Pinkie Pie sings onstage.\nLater, as the party winds down, Rainbow Dash thanks Cheese Sandwich for the epic party, and a satisfied Cheese is ready to move on, donning his cowboy hat and poncho. Before he says goodbye, he gives Boneless, his rubber chicken companion, to Pinkie Pie\u2014it briefly gives off a rainbow-colored glow. With a second rubber chicken (\"Boneless 2\") on his saddle, Cheese Sandwich leaves Ponyville, and the six friends watch him walk off into the sunset. Pinkie jokingly states that she never got his name, and her friends reaffirm her that it's Cheese Sandwich.\n"}, {"summary": " The ponies of Ponyville gather in front of town hall as the pony of ceremonies for the upcoming Ponyville Days festival is chosen, the selection committee on which Granny Smith serves. Mayor Mare announces Rarity as the pony of ceremonies. As Twilight Sparkle asks Rarity what her plans for the event are, Spike produces a small-scale model of Ponyville.\nAt Carousel Boutique, Rarity presents to her friends her plans for the festival, which include a cider auction and tasting, a gala in the town square, and a fashion show. While her friends are more than impressed by her efforts and volunteer to help organize the event, Rarity is most concerned with impressing travel writer Trenderhoof. Twilight teases Rarity for her apparent crush, and Rarity makes no effort in hiding it.\nAt the train station, Rarity and Twilight await Trenderhoof's arrival, with Rarity beside herself with nervousness. When Trenderhoof finally appears, Rarity is unable to bring herself to even say hello and hides under Twilight's tail. Twilight is forced to drag her friend over to introduce herself. Trenderhoof says hello, and Rarity proceeds to faint.\n Rarity shows Trenderhoof around Ponyville, specifically spots that will serve as venues for the Ponyville Days festival events, and Trenderhoof is moderately impressed. However, he seems particularly taken with Sweet Apple Acres, especially Applejack the moment he sees her. The travel writer becomes instantly smitten with the farm-pony and calls her the pony of his dreams, devastating Rarity.\nBack at Carousel Boutique, Spike finds Rarity in hysterics, lamenting that Trenderhoof is attracted to another mare despite having been obsessed with him for years herself. She begins to wonder what Applejack has that she doesn't. Meanwhile, Trenderhoof follows Applejack around Ponyville; Applejack does her best to keep him entertained, but she starts to get uncomfortable by his obsession with her. When Rarity appears in a sparkly mock cowpony outfit and claims to share Applejack's passion for apples, she still fails to draw Trenderhoof's attention.\n Rarity tries several attempts to steal Trenderhoof away from Applejack, including plowing fields and apple-bucking. However, her attempts all fail and only attract Trenderhoof to Applejack more.\nFrustrated by all the attention, Applejack isolates herself from Trenderhoof and actively avoids him. She hides in the barn and finds Rarity. Despite Applejack's efforts to explain that she doesn't know why Trenderhoof is fixated on her, Rarity will hear none of it. Convinced that Applejack is out to steal Trenderhoof from her, Rarity starts acting more like Applejack, including taking on a country accent.\nTwilight and the others gather at Carousel Boutique again as Rarity unveils her new \"Simple Ways\" theme for the Ponyville Days festival: a theme reminiscent of farm and country life, with Rarity herself wearing a straw hat and overalls. Her friends are skeptical of this development, with Applejack insinuating that she's only doing it to impress Trenderhoof. Rarity dismisses the implication and leaves to organize the festival according to her new theme, frustrating Applejack even more.\n At Sweet Apple Acres, Rarity scouts models for the fashion show as \"Apple Jewel\"\u2014Applejack in a lavish dress\u2014appears before her, attempting to beat her at her own game. As Applejack models and exhibits a passion for high class and culture, Rarity responds with a love for the simple life, hard work, and mud. When she splashes mud on Applejack's dress, Rarity drops the act. She apologizes to Applejack for her behavior and insults and thanks her for helping her realize how silly she'd been.\nAt that moment, Trenderhoof appears in a straw hat and overalls. He states that he's giving up being a travel writer and is moving to Ponyville to work on a farm. Rarity convinces him that no one should change themselves so much just to impress somepony else.\n With Rarity's guidance, the Ponyville Days festival is finally thrown, using her original \"small town chic\" theme. As Rarity narrates about the lesson she learned, the festival is a complete success. Trenderhoof dances with Granny Smith during the town square gala, and he gives Rarity a rose during the fashion show."}, {"summary": " At Fluttershy's cottage, Fluttershy says good morning to her animal friends, feeding them and joining the birds in glorious song. As the animals applaud Fluttershy, Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Applejack appear, impressed by their friend's singing talent.\nRarity in particular wonders why Fluttershy, with her beautiful voice, isn't already a member of the Pony Tones \u2014 who are to perform at Fluttershy's fundraiser for the Ponyville Pet Center the following evening. While Fluttershy is one of the Pony Tones' biggest fans and is thankful for their involvement, she refuses to perform with them because of her terrible stage fright. Rarity understands her friend's plight, and the six friends go to set up the fundraiser together.\nAs multiple ponies help with the fundraiser preparations, Rarity and her fellow Pony Tones practice for their upcoming performance. They sing a short version of Find the Music in You, with Fluttershy watching in awe. Rarity dismisses the other singers to rest their voices for the day, and Fluttershy thanks Rarity for her efforts.\n The next morning, the Pony Tones meet for rehearsal, but Big McIntosh is running late. When he finally arrives, the others are shocked to discover he's lost his voice during a turkey call competition (which he lost to Pinkie Pie). With the Pony Tones now without one member, Fluttershy fears for the fundraiser's outcome. When Rarity mentions having no \"remedy\" for the situation, Fluttershy gets the idea to consult Zecora.\nAt her Everfree Forest hut, Zecora examines Big McIntosh and says she can cure him, but not in time for the Pony Tones' fundraiser performance. As Fluttershy wonders where they'll find a replacement for Big Mac's bass voice, Zecora reminds her of her run-in with the poison joke that deepened her voice. She offers to make a brew of poison joke leaves that will turn Fluttershy into \"Flutterguy\" again. Fluttershy is nervous about singing in front of everypony, but Rarity finds a solution to that problem.\n The fundraiser for the Pet Center is a success, and ponies gather near the stage for the main event. The Pony Tones sing Find the Music in You, with Fluttershy\u2014and her poison joke-affected voice\u2014supplying Big McIntosh's vocals behind the curtain. When the song ends, the ponies in the crowd cheer, and Fluttershy is motivated to sing more.\nThe Pony Tones are approached by a Pegasus stallion and asked to perform at his daughter Zipporwhill's cute-cea\u00f1era the next day. Rarity is uncertain because it's so last-minute, but Fluttershy doesn't want to disappoint Zipporwhill and convinces her to say yes. The Pony Tones thus perform at Zipporwhill's cute-cea\u00f1era, at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for Mayor Mare, for the spa ponies at the Ponyville Day Spa, and for Cheerilee's class at the Ponyville Schoolhouse. With each performance the Pony Tones give, Fluttershy starts to lose herself in her singing, giving Big McIntosh trouble keeping up with her improvisations.\n Moments before their performance at Sugarcube Corner, Rarity informs Fluttershy that Big McIntosh's voice is better, meaning she no longer has to sing for him. Rarity and Big McIntosh notice Fluttershy's disappointment and agree to let her sing for him one last time. However, during the song, Fluttershy gets carried away and knocks the curtain down, exposing herself to the audience. Though the ponies cheer for her, Fluttershy's stage fright gets the better of her and she bolts out crying. Big McIntosh helps her friends assess the situation shortly before they follow.\n Fluttershy's friends find her alone in her cottage, with her voice back to normal after her bath. Due to Pinkie Pie's lack of subtlety, Fluttershy bursts into tears and runs off into the night with her friends following once more. The ponies have no shortage of compliments for Fluttershy and her performance, but she vows to never perform in public ever again. Rarity reminds Fluttershy that it was her who encouraged the Pony Tones to perform for every possible occasion \u2014 she knew Fluttershy had wanted to sing. Fluttershy thinks back on the crowd's reception of her singing and smiles.\nAs the newest member of the Pony Tones, Fluttershy sings a reprisal of Music in the Treetops/Find the Music in You for her pony and animal friends. When she hears the Pony Tones have been booked for an Apple Family Zap Apple Jam Extraordinaire event, Fluttershy is reluctant to perform, but says she'll \"get there someday\".\nFluttershy writes her lesson in the friendship journal and sings with one of her birds just before the episode closes.\n"}, {"summary": " In the Golden Oak Library, the Cutie Mark Crusaders are learning new skills with Twilight Sparkle's help.

She entices the colts and fillies with an acrobatic display she had promised to put on, but she has her butler Randolph perform it for her. The foals eat it up and shower Diamond Tiara with praise, and the Crusaders are frustrated by the attention she receives for not doing anything.\n Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon ask the Crusaders if they'll be going to Manehattan anytime soon, with the prospect of letting them meet celebrities. When Sweetie Belle says no, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon brag. Upset, Sweetie Belle brags herself that she and her friends hang out with Princess Twilight all the time.

Realizing the darker side of popularity, the Crusaders excuse themselves from the party for \"Twilight Time\". When Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon ask to come along, the Crusaders say no. This incites Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon's anger, as well as that of the other foals, and the Crusaders run away.\nThey race toward the library to explain the situation to Twilight, but the other foals cut them off at the door.

But when Twilight tells them to prove it, they fail to perform due to shirking their practice. Twilight excuses all the foals from the library once she realizes none of them are interested in learning anything.

Rarity is uncertain she'll have time to do so, but before she disappoints Sweetie Belle, she believes she'll be able to with the help of a few extra ponies. Sweetie Belle showers Rarity with thanks and points to her dresses, which Rarity notices are horrid in design.\nOn opening night, ponies fill the auditorium as Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and an ever-impatient Cheerilee wait for Rarity to arrive with their dresses. Sweetie Belle admits to having waited until the last minute to ask for Rarity's help, as she wrote and directed the play and wanted the chance to shine on her own. Rarity finally arrives with the dresses, largely improved from Sweetie Belle's original designs, and the play goes on without a hitch, even receiving a standing ovation.\nThe Cutie Mark Crusaders enter the lobby to accept their audience's praise but find their sisters absent, having gone to pack Sapphire Shores' wardrobe. What's more, the only thing the other ponies remember about the play and talk about are the dresses the Crusaders wore, much to Sweetie Belle's frustration.\n As Rarity and her friends pack Sapphire Shores' costumes into boxes at the Boutique, Sweetie Belle storms in. The rest of the Mane Six excuse themselves as Sweetie Belle accuses Rarity of stealing her spotlight. Rarity says she only did what she thought Sweetie Belle wanted, but the angry filly will hear none of it and walks out.\nSweetie Belle paces back and forth in her room, venting her frustrations. Rarity, hearing her from outside, decides to give her time alone. Hours later, Sweetie Belle tries in vain to go to sleep. After having a glass of water, she walks by Rarity's bedroom. In an attempt to get back at Rarity, Sweetie Belle sneaks in and unravels the centerpiece on the headdress of Sapphire Shores' costume. She returns to her room and is finally able to sleep.\n Sweetie Belle has a dream of receiving an award for her play. As she accepts her reward, it starts to rain, the ponies all run away, and the award melts in Sweetie Belle's hooves. The cause is a laughing storm cloud resembling Rarity. As the cloud attacks Sweetie Belle with lightning, Princess Luna intervenes and banishes the cloud, and Sweetie Belle realizes that she is dreaming.\nLuna sympathizes with Sweetie Belle for being overshadowed by an older sister. She takes the filly into a flashback of her fifth birthday party. Sweetie Belle recalls that Rarity ended up stealing the spotlight from her in spite of her best efforts to make a grand entrance. Luna explains that Sweetie Belle does not know the whole story and shows her the flashback from Rarity's point of view: the foals at Sweetie Belle's party were getting tired of waiting for her, and Rarity tried to salvage the party for Sweetie Belle's sake.\n Luna then shows Sweetie Belle a flashback of earlier in the evening, and she sees Rarity struggling with impressing Sapphire Shores with her costumes. As Sweetie Belle hopes everything works out for her, Luna shows Sweetie Belle what the future potentially holds because of her actions. She sees Rarity's efforts to impress Sapphire Shores ending in disaster, her reputation in Equestria getting ruined, secluding herself from the Mane Six, and becoming a frantic recluse while slowly becoming more and more insane.\nSweetie Belle pleads to wake up and finally jolts awake from her horrible nightmare. She hurries to fix her mistake, but Rarity has already left for Canterlot with the dresses, much to Sweetie's shock and horror.\nSweetie Belle and her friends then take a train ride to Canterlot. While Sweetie Belle is concerned about fixing the dress she ruined, Apple Bloom and Scootaloo are more excited about meeting Sapphire Shores.\n At a studio in Canterlot, Sapphire and her backup dancers rehearse a dance for Rarity. Outside, the Crusaders' efforts to go inside are hindered by a security guard. As Rarity shows Sapphire the costumes, the Crusaders zip-line into the studio from an upper story window. Just before Rarity can show Sapphire the headdress, Sweetie Belle zooms in, snatches the box away, and runs off with it, prompting Rarity to follow. Rarity chases the Crusaders up and down the studio as they keep the box away from her. Sweetie Belle runs into a vacant room with the box and shuts the door behind her, where she meets Princess Luna again. Sweetie Belle believes she's dreaming again, but Luna assures her that she's awake. Sweetie Belle simply wishes to fix everything, and Luna offers to help.\nSweetie Belle leaves the room some time later and meets Rarity. She demands an explanation, and Sweetie Belle gives one, saying she wanted to fix what she ruined before it was too late. She returns the fixed headdress, and Rarity notices she made a change to it, a change that Sweetie Belle is sure Sapphire Shores will love.\n Rarity and Sweetie Belle return to Sapphire Shores, who tries on the completed headdress. She's only mildly impressed with it until she notices the dolphin-shaped stitching on the centerpiece. Sapphire states the dolphin is her lucky animal and they swim with her in her dreams. Rarity asks Sweetie Belle where she came up with the idea. Sweetie Belle looks to Princess Luna by the door and says it came to her in a dream.\nSweetie Belle apologizes to Rarity for getting upset about the dresses, and Rarity apologizes for missing the play. She wonders about catching an encore performance, but Sweetie Belle admits her play was not that good and that \"the costumes were the best part,\" as Rarity hugs her."}, {"summary": "The Apple family enjoys a day at a local swimming hole, but only Applejack, Apple Bloom, and Big McIntosh have fun in the water. Despite her past as a well-known swimmer and high diver, Granny Smith is too old and achy to even get near the water.\nOn the family's way back into Ponyville, Apple Bloom expresses interest in becoming a high diver herself, but Granny Smith protests, citing the sport's incredible dangers. During their conversation, the family is passed by a large crowd of ponies\u2014most of them in bandages\u2014making their way to a circus tent. The Apple family follows to see what's going on.\n Inside the tent, on a stage, a mechanical organ produces cheery music as salesponies nonpareil Flim and Flam step out from behind a curtain, making Applejack and Big McIntosh immediately suspicious. Through their signature smooth talk and an upbeat crowd-stirring musical number, the brothers offer the aching ponies of Ponyville a cure for what ails them: a tonic that they guarantee will heal them of whatever ailments they suffer from. After a demonstration of the tonic's effect on a pony who walks with crutches, Granny Smith is convinced and purchases a bottle of the brothers' miracle elixir, much to Applejack and Big McIntosh's worry.\n Back at the creek, Applejack and Apple Bloom talk while Big Mac fishes. Apple Bloom is amazed by Flim and Flam's tonic, but Applejack is far from convinced that the tonic works as advertised.\nJust then, the Apple siblings see Granny Smith drifting down the creek. Believing she's in trouble, the siblings try to save her, but Granny Smith simply swims around their attempts, having never been in any danger at all. In spite of Applejack's misgivings about Flim and Flam's tonic, its effects on Granny Smith are clear; she appears to be as fit as a filly. Apple Bloom wonders what's in the tonic, and Applejack suggests they find out.\nApplejack and Apple Bloom return to Flim and Flam's tent and spot the pony from the brothers' first tonic demonstration. As soon as he sees them, he runs away, prompting Applejack and Apple Bloom to chase after him. They corner the pony, who introduces himself as Silver Shill, and ask him about the tonic. Applejack notices the props and wigs around her and discovers that Silver Shill is part of Flim and Flam's act. Before she can squeeze a confession out of him, he blindsides the two sisters with steam and runs away.\nApplejack locates Silver Shill and follows him into the tent, where she also finds Flim and Flam. She confronts the two about their scam, and while Flim and Flam partially admit that their tonic is nothing but apple juice and beet leaves, the fact remains that Granny Smith is happier for trying it. Applejack, not wanting to take that away from her, concedes that Granny Smith's happiness is all that matters and leaves with Apple Bloom.\nAt the swimming hole, Granny Smith is able to take part in her grandchildren's fun thanks to the tonic. Apple Bloom suggests to Granny that they enter the upcoming Ponyville Swim Meet together, as Granny's history as an aquapony would assure them a win. Granny is unsure about getting back into competitive swimming, but Applejack encourages her to enter. With this encouragement, Granny Smith returns to Flim and Flam's tent and buys their entire stock of tonic. Applejack even unwittingly gives the tonic her stamp of approval, convincing the rest of Ponyville to give Flim and Flam their business.\n At the Ponyville Swim Meet, Granny Smith and Apple Bloom prepare to compete while Flim and Flam use the publicity of the event to sell even more tonic. Together, the filly and elderly mare give a graceful performance that earns cheers from the crowd and a perfect score from the judges. Aside, Applejack finds Silver Shill selling tonic near the stands, and he thanks Applejack for teaching him that \"sometimes honesty isn't the best policy.\" Before she receives more recognition for her dishonesty, Applejack decides to put a stop to Flim and Flam's fraud.\nJust then, she sees Granny Smith climbing the high dive, preparing to break the Equestria high-diving record. She manages to stop Granny from diving into a small container of water and seriously injuring herself. As Granny grumbles over Applejack's interference and guzzles another bottle of tonic, the sun's rays reflect off the bottle and create a rainbow. The same array of colors shimmer in Applejack's eyes, and she decides to come clean.\nApplejack tells the ponies that Flim and Flam's tonic is fake and confesses to going along with the deceit. When Apple Bloom wonders about Granny Smith's physical feats, Applejack proposes it was simply mind over matter: it was confidence that gave Granny Smith strength, not the tonic.\nFlim and Flam attempt to win back the crowd's favor, but Silver Shill intervenes. Inspired by Applejack's honesty and bravery, he too confesses to being in on the act. Defeated once again, Flim and Flam make a subtle retreat. Silver Shill, grateful to Applejack for helping him see the truth, gives her the bit he earned while selling the tonic and promises to pay back the pony he sold it to.\n\nLater, as Big McIntosh tends to the fields at Sweet Apple Acres, Applejack writes her friendship lesson in the Mane 6's journal. Granny Smith plays with Apple Bloom in a smaller pool, and Applejack goes to join them. As she trots away, the bit given to her by Silver Shill shines with a rainbow-colored glow."}, {"summary": " The episode opens just outside Golden Oak Library; in the middle of Twilight Sparkle\u00a0reading a book, Rainbow Dash swoops by and interrupts her. Twilight flies up and gives Rainbow an earful about not studying for her upcoming exam to join the Wonderbolts Reserves. While Twilight stresses how important the test is, Rainbow Dash is not as concerned. Suddenly, Twilight comes up with the idea of tutoring Rainbow for the test and teleports herself and Rainbow inside the library.\nWorking off of a checklist, Twilight tries various methods to help Rainbow Dash prepare for her test, including reading and highlighting, history lectures, and flashcards. Unfortunately, Rainbow's approach to reading and highlighting involves highlighting everything in a book; she becomes easily bored and distracted during Twilight's lectures; and she spends all of Twilight's flashcards segment shooting spit wads at her.\nAfter an unsuccessful quizzing session, Rainbow Dash starts to worry that she'll fail the test, placing blame on Twilight and her faulty studying methods. The two begin to bicker, and before it gets out of hand, Fluttershy intervenes with her own idea to help Rainbow.\nFluttershy's method of teaching involves a play starring the Mane Six's pets, with Angel playing the role of Princess Celestia, Opalescence as Princess Luna, and Gummy, Winona, and Tank as various kinds of ponies. However, the stage soon collapses when Tank crashes, and the performance only leaves Rainbow Dash confused.\nPinkie Pie then enters with her own method of teaching Rainbow their history: through rap. Rainbow finds the song catchy enough, but she's unable to retain its lyrics.\nRarity arrives to help and attempts to teach Rainbow Dash the history of the Wonderbolts through their historical fashions, with which their friends all assist, but Rainbow Dash still has difficulties. Applejack has no advice for Rainbow, as she believes things are best learned through personal experience.\nBefore long, Rainbow Dash's friends start arguing about whose studying methods are best, pushing her to the brink of desperation.\nConvinced that she will never pass the entrance exam, Rainbow flies off.\nTwilight joins Rainbow Dash in the sky and apologizes for overwhelming her. She tries to cheer Rainbow up, but Rainbow just puts herself down, calling herself \"too dumb to learn anything.\" As Twilight tries to get through to her friend, Rainbow shoves Twilight away. Twilight is annoyed at first, but she soon realizes Rainbow had stopped her from crashing into Cherry Berry's pedal-operated helicopter.\nWhen Twilight asks how Rainbow noticed the helicopter when she was focused on her, Rainbow explains that she knows how to multitask: while she paying attention to Twilight, she was also monitoring the ground and sky. She'd noticed the Cutie Mark Crusaders coming out of Sugarcube Corner, and she saw Big McIntosh selling a large order of apples to Filthy Rich.\nWith this knowledge, Twilight comes up with an idea and flies away, leaving Rainbow to sulk. She meets with the rest of her friends to tell them her plan: with each of their ways of helping Rainbow Dash having ended in failure, they decide to try \"Rainbow Dash's way.\"\nA short time later, Twilight returns to where she left Rainbow and asks her if she wants to go for a fly. Though she's deeply depressed, Rainbow agrees. During their flight, Twilight makes small talk with Rainbow, and Rainbow still belittles herself, declaring that her dreams of being a Wonderbolt are over.\nWhen they reach Rainbow's house, Twilight asks Rainbow what she remembers about the flight. Rainbow, to her surprise and delight, finds that she's able to recall facts about the Wonderbolts' history with ease. When she asks how that is, Twilight explains that she took advantage of Rainbow's monitoring ability and enlisted the help of numerous ponies to teach her without her realizing.\nRainbow Dash thanks her friends for all their help, but Twilight says Rainbow deserves all the credit herself for her ability to absorb information while flying.\n In the friendship journal, Twilight writes that Rainbow Dash had successfully learned the history of the Wonderbolts and that she herself learned there's no perfect method of learning\u2014\"everypony is unique and individual\". Elsewhere, Rainbow Dash completes her entrance exam and gives it to the examiner.

As the official princess representative for the Exchange, Twilight finds a large welcoming party waiting for her.\nEach of the seven friends are at the Exchange with various prospects in mind: Spike seeks to trade a mint condition Power Ponies comic book for another; Rainbow Dash hopes to acquire a first-edition copy of Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Statue; Fluttershy wants to trade a bear call for a bird whistle; Applejack and Rarity seek out rare, vintage items and decide to pool together their trade stashes; and Twilight herself hopes to trade away some of her old books.\nAt a trading stand owned by a collector of Daring Do merchandise, Rainbow Dash finds the first-edition book she seeks. However, all she has to trade for it is an old, rusty horseshoe, which the collector refuses to accept. The collector only agrees to trade the book for an orthros owned by a dealer of ancient beasts.\nElsewhere, Applejack and Rarity each find a vintage item they want, but each item costs all of their goods. Applejack seeks a pie tin that Rarity visibly disapproves of, and Rarity seeks a brooch that Applejack notes looks no different than the one she's currently wearing. Tensions rise as the two ponies argue over each other's prospective trades.\n Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy approach the ancient beast dealer, but he refuses Rainbow's rusty horseshoe as well. When the orthros breaks the dealer's lamp, he agrees to trade the orthros away for a new lamp. Thus, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy approach Stellar Eclipse, a trader of Discord-shaped lamps, who agrees to trade one of his lamps for an antique chicken statue. A trader of antique chickens agrees to trade one for a crystal chalice. Rainbow and Fluttershy find a trader of crystal chalices who, ironically enough, agrees to trade one for Rainbow's horseshoe. Unfortunately, as soon as the trade is made, the chalice shatters in Rainbow's hooves.\nMeanwhile, Pinkie Pie stops Twilight from trading away all her books for a young filly's broken quill, enforcing the rule of the Traders Exchange that a trade is only fair if both ponies end up with something they want. Because she doesn't have any plans to trade her own possessions, Pinkie decides to help keep Twilight from making the same mistake and sets up a booth to promote the books as \"official princess merchandise\", which draws in a large crowd of ponies.\n Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy glue the crystal chalice back together and bring it to the antique chicken trader, hoping he won't notice its condition. The trader accepts and smashes the chalice with a hammer to finish a broken glass mosaic. Realizing they don't know what kind of chicken the lamp trader wants, Rainbow Dash sends Fluttershy to check while she remains by the chicken stand to keep other buyers away. The Pegasi fly over Applejack and Rarity, who are arguing for the other to get what she wants to prove themselves the better friend. Upon returning to the lamp stand with the antique chicken in tow, Rainbow and Fluttershy discover that Stellar Eclipse has gone on break, frustrating Rainbow Dash.\nBack at Twilight's stand, Pinkie becomes something of an auctioneer and hypes up Twilight's books to the crowd of ponies. Twilight becomes uncomfortable with the attention, stating that no one should trade for her books simply because she's a princess. Pinkie acknowledges Twilight's feelings but proceeds to mention to the crowd that the books were given to Twilight by Princess Celestia, exciting the crowd even more.\nRainbow and Fluttershy find Stellar Eclipse again, who is in line for oat burgers and refuses to do any trading until he's eaten one. Remembering that the Exchange ends at sundown, Rainbow and Fluttershy assist in making oat burgers and moving the line along faster.\nFinally, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy make the exchange for the orthros and make their way to the Daring Do stand; the two pass Applejack and Rarity along the way, who continue to bicker. The Pegasi find their path blocked by a crowd of ponies and see the Daring Do collector beginning to pack away her untraded goods for the day. Fluttershy remembers her bear call and uses it to scare the entire crowd away. In their haste to reach the stand, Fluttershy drops her bear call, which is lost among the returning crowd.\nWhen the Pegasi finally reach the stand, the Daring Do collector tells them she no longer wants the orthros as she is frightened of the vicious creature, to Rainbow's outrage. Fluttershy asks the collector to reconsider, demonstrating her expertise at taming the canine. The collector agrees to give Rainbow the book on the condition that Fluttershy stays in Manehattan with them to help train the orthros. Fluttershy reasons she would need to leave Ponyville for countless moons but reluctantly agrees for Rainbow's sake. Rainbow eagerly makes the deal and claims the book as her own, only to realize moments later that she has just traded away her friend.\nPinkie continues to promote Twilight's books, especially the \"princess\" aspect, and is about to make a sale until she mentions that the books made Twilight the princess she is. Realizing they have nothing to match such value, the ponies disperse. Twilight herself also realizes how much the books mean to her, as they\u2014like Pinkie said\u2014made her who she is. Suddenly, Rainbow Dash zooms onto the scene and pleads for Twilight to exert her princess authority and declare a trade unfair.\n Twilight presides over a small trial to decide the fairness of the trade; because Rainbow Dash said the trade was fair, her hooves are tied. Rainbow Dash argues that the trade cannot be fair because, though she wanted the book more than anything, nothing is worth more to her than a friend. The Daring Do collector is moved by Rainbow's words and calls the trade off. Rainbow Dash returns the book to the collector, and Twilight declares both the trial and the Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange closed.\nIn the end, Spike turns out to be the only one of Twilight's friends to walk away from the Exchange with an uninterrupted trade.\n On the train ride back to Ponyville, Rarity gives Applejack a different pie tin that she was able to trade for. In return, Applejack gives Rarity a jeweled barrette that she traded her half of their stash for. When Pinkie Pie asks about the orthros, Rainbow Dash says she traded it for a bird whistle for Fluttershy. As consolation for giving up the first-edition Daring Do book, Twilight gives Rainbow her old paperback copy of The Sapphire Statue. Rainbow cherishes the gift even more than the first-edition because she can read it with all of her friends."}, {"summary": " All of Ponyville is busy preparing for the Foal and Filly Fair, a festival dedicated to the colts and fillies of Ponyville. At Carousel Boutique, Rarity is hard at work making her own creative contribution to the fair: a lavish puppet theater. She thanks Spike for his help and calls him her \"favorite dragon\", a compliment that causes Spike to blush.\nRarity is pleased with her own work, but Claude, the puppeteer pony she made the theater for, is utterly dissatisfied, criticizing its lack of mobility and room for his puppets. As Claude walks off in a huff, Rarity runs off in tears.\nRarity returns to the Boutique and wails over her failure to impress. Spike suggests that she make something else for the fair, but Rarity doesn't think she'd have anything finished in time. She sobs hysterically and starts wolfing down a carton of ice cream.\n Determined to help Rarity out of her creative funk, Spike goes to the Castle of the Two Sisters with Owlowiscious and searches through the library for a spell that can help. Through Owlowiscious' hooting, Spike understands that he believes they shouldn't use magic. During his search, Spike uncovers a hidden chamber behind one of the bookshelves. Inside, he finds a spell book made of stone and with spikes on the front cover. Oblivious of the danger of taking the spell book from its hiding place and Owlowiscious' hooting warnings, Spike opens the book and finds the \"Inspiration Manifestation\" spell that \"instantly brings ideas to life\".Spike returns to Rarity, who's now gone through several cartons of ice cream, and shows her what he found. Rarity brings herself out of her despair to try the spell:\n As a result of casting the spell, Rarity's magic aura turns green. With the spell's magic, Rarity transforms the stone spell book and her couch using only her thoughts. She returns to Claude with a puppet theater more to his liking and earns his approval. After a successful Foal and Filly Fair, Spike decides to return the spell book to where he found it, but Rarity convinces him to let her hold on to it a little longer. Spike doesn't see any harm, but Owlowiscious is less than certain.\nWhen Spike goes to the Boutique the next day, he's overwhelmed by an avalanche of dresses when the front door opens. A slightly manic Rarity pulls him inside, and he finds the Boutique packed with dresses Rarity spent all night making. She decides to extend her newfound creativity to all of Ponyville and asks for Spike's support, which he readily gives.\nRarity begins her beautification of Ponyville by transforming Applejack and Granny Smith's ordinary apple cart into a lavish one studded with jewels. An impressed Spike suggests asking Applejack to give all of her carts the same treatment, but Rarity wants to keep the changes she makes around town a secret from other ponies.\n Next, Rarity gives Rainbow Dash a cumbersome dress while she's in the middle of busting clouds; she turns one of Fluttershy's bird houses into a bird mansion that her bird friend Mr. Robin gets lost inside; and she gives a foal birthday party a \"touch of class\" by replacing the food with hors d'oeuvres, the clown with the waiter Savoir Fare, and the mariachi trio with a string trio consisting of Octavia Melody, Parish Nandermane, and another Earth pony.\nSpike sees that ponies are less than pleased with Rarity's changes, but he can't bring himself to tell her to stop. Rarity gives Spike a suit of crystal armor and runs off to make more changes around Ponyville, leaving Spike behind. Twilight Sparkle then finds him and sees that whatever is happening around town has happened to him as well. She asks him if he's seen anyone suspicious, but he keeps Rarity's secret and says no. Twilight goes with Mayor Mare to assist the trapped ponies Royal Riff and Berryshine, while Owlowiscious glares disapprovingly at Spike. Although Spike realizes he must reveal Rarity's secret, he is afraid to do so as it could cost him her friendship.\n Unable to bring himself to divulge Rarity's secret, Spike determines that the next best way to stop Rarity is to get the spell book away from her so she can't harness its magic. He follows Rarity's path of creative destruction and finds her on the outskirts of Ponyville. While Owlowiscious distracts Rarity, Spike snatches the spell book from her and sneaks away. Rarity catches Spike, so he hides the book in his mouth and swallows it down whole.\nUnfortunately, Rarity is still under the influence of Inspiration Manifestation. Spike is shocked by this development, and though Rarity is initially upset by the loss of her book, she doesn't need it anymore in order to use its magic. She crafts four chariots (or \"Rariots\" as she calls them) and plans to spread her creative genius to all of Equestria.\n Before the situation gets even more out of control, Spike tells Rarity the truth: that the changes she's been making around Ponyville are awful. Rarity is aghast at Spike's words, and the magic of Inspiration Manifestation finally wears off. Spike suddenly remembers the last part of the spell \u2014 \"only when true words are spoken will you finally be set free\"\u00a0\u2014 and realizes his telling Rarity the truth was what broke the spell's hold. Rarity tells Spike he should never be afraid of telling her the truth, and the two share a friendly hug. At the Golden Oak Library, as Spike writes down his lesson in the friendship journal, Twilight enters and scolds him for taking a book from the old castle library without permission. She collapses onto her bed, exhausted from cleaning up Rarity's magical mess with Princess Luna and Princess Cadance. In response to Twilight's anger, Spike simply says, \"You don't look so good,\" angering her even more.\n"}, {"summary": "The Ponyville representative teams are on their way to the Equestria Games.

Apple Bloom starts to worry that they're not prepared for their flag-carrying routine, so Spike teaches her a trick he uses whenever he gets nervous about a task: counting to ten.\nDuring his talk with the Crusaders, Spike is suddenly carried away by a pair of Crystal Pony royal guards, who deliver him to Twilight Sparkle and Princess Cadance in front of the palace. Inside, the Crystal Ponies pamper Spike and treat him like royalty. Twilight and Cadance explain that, because of Spike's role in saving the Empire from King Sombra, he is recognized throughout the Empire as a hero and is known as \"Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious\".\nBecause of this, Cadance asks Spike to light the torch during the Equestria Games' opening ceremony. Spike gladly agrees, adding that as a dragon he can do so with his fire breath.\nIn the Equestria Games stadium, a gigantic crowd of ponies cheers and Shining Armor briefly addresses the athletic and flag-carrying teams. Twilight goes up to the exclusive box seats, where Princess Celestia, Princess Luna, and other significant members of Equestrian society are already seated, and takes her seat next to Celestia.\nSpike makes his way to the stadium with Ms. Harshwhinny, who explains to him the procedure for lighting the Games torch. When they reach the torch platform, Spike becomes overwhelmed by the sheer number of ponies watching him. The Cutie Mark Crusaders carry out their flag routine and the Ponyville team enters the stadium. With some persuasion by Ms. Harshwhinny, Spike climbs up to the torch and finds both his fire breath and his calming trick of counting to ten not working.\nDue to the torch lightning's delay, ponies in the crowd become confused or worried. When Twilight sees the trouble Spike is in, she discreetly casts a spell that lights the torch for him, and the crowd cheers. Ms. Harshwhinny is unsure how Spike pulled it off, but nevertheless, the Equestria Games finally begin.Outside the stadium, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Applejack congratulate the Crusaders for their flag routine. Twilight meets with her friends and admits to them that she lit the torch for Spike so he wouldn't be embarrassed. When Spike walks up, Twilight is about to tell him the truth, but he's convinced that he can light fires with his mind. He tries to demonstrate this \"skill\" for Bright Smile and Elbow Grease but to no avail. Twilight takes Spike aside and tells him that she lit the torch for him. Thinking that he's let down all of Equestria, Spike walks away utterly heartbroken.\nTwilight's friends return to the stadium in time for the aerial relay\u2014Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy's event. As they enter, Rarity is told by security guards to have her magic disabled before entering the stadium to prevent cheating. As the aerial relay takes place, Spike asks Ms. Harshwhinny if he can do anything else for the Games. Ms. Harshwhinny is dismissive of his request; when she makes a sarcastic remark about him putting on a rock concert, Spike gets an idea.\nIn the aerial relay, the Wonderbolts take gold and the Ponyville team silver. At the medal-awarding ceremony, Shining Armor is about to signal the start of an anthem when Spike jumps in, eager to \"do the honor of singing\". Unfortunately, since the Wonderbolts won the event, the anthem to be sung is the Cloudsdale anthem, to which Spike doesn't know the words. With the spotlight and everyone's eyes focused on him, Spike sings an awkward and lyrically inaccurate rendition of the Cloudsdale anthem, much to the discomfort of everyone listening (except Pinkie Pie, who gives his performance an excited \"Nailed it!\").\n For the rest of the Games, Spike holes up in a Crystal Empire bedroom, where the Crusaders find him packing up for their departure the next day. Back at the stadium, Shining Armor announces the final event of the Games: ice archery. With Ponyville having thirty-seven medals to Cloudsdale's thirty-six and Cloudsdale having two archers taking part in the event, Twilight's friends are anxious over the outcome.\nWhen Twilight goes to drag Spike out of hiding, he disguises himself and continually puts himself down, reluctant to face the crowds again. During the ice archery event, one of the archers trips up and accidentally shoots an ice arrow into the sky. The arrow turns a cloud into a large mass of ice that starts to fall toward the stadium. A number of Pegasi fly up to slow it down but are unable to divert it away from the crowd, and the security guards don't have time to undo their magic-disabling spell.\n Springing into action, Spike hops up on the backs of several Pegasi and shoots the ice from below with a tremendous blast of fire, melting it into water and steam. The crowd cheers, and all of Spike's friends commend him for his actions. Spike, however, feels no pride in himself and simply did \"what needed to be done\". Twilight understands, saying that only Spike can fix the disappointment he has in himself. To that end, Cadance asks Spike to light the fireworks for the Equestria Games' closing ceremony in her stead.\nIn the end, Ponyville wins the medal count for the Games by a single medal, and the closing ceremony is underway.

The feeling is only made worse when, during the dignitaries' welcoming ceremony, all Twilight does is unveil a royal banner.\n After saying goodbye to the dignitaries, Twilight asks Princesses Celestia, Luna, and Cadance if there's anything else she can do, but Cadance tells her their visit is already over. Twilight is disappointed that, compared to her fellow princesses of Equestria, her own role as a princess is unclear and she wants to have a purpose.

As Celestia gets out of bed, she forebodingly states \"the stronger he becomes, the more we are all in danger\".\nThrough a storybook, Celestia and Luna tell Twilight the history of Tirek: originally, he and his brother Scorpan came to Equestria from \"a distant land\" with the intent of stealing Equestrian magic. However, Scorpan came to appreciate the ponies' ways, and even befriended a young unicorn wizard. He pleaded with Tirek to abandon their plan, and when he refused, Scorpan alerted the princesses of Tirek's intentions. He then returned to his homeland, while Tirek was sentenced to prison in Tartarus for his crimes.\nCelestia and Luna deduce that Tirek must have escaped Tartarus when Cerberus last abandoned its gates; only now, they reason, has Tirek regained enough strength to use his dark powers. With the threat of Tirek's strength returning looming over their heads, Cadance elects Twilight to stop him. Before she can accept, however, Celestia woefully tells Twilight that she has chosen another in her stead: Discord.\n Twilight relays Celestia's decision to her friends in Ponyville, and while most of them are skeptical of Discord's assistance, Fluttershy has the utmost faith in him. With nothing to do in the meantime, Twilight concedes to go to the Castle of the Royal Pony Sisters and \"catch up on some reading\", and her friends accompany her.\nOn their way to the castle, the ponies recall having to give up the Elements of Harmony to the Tree of Harmony. As they converse, Discord arrives, reading some of the Mane Six's entries in their friendship journal before heading off to track down Tirek. He also wonders why Twilight has yet to open the Tree of Harmony's chest, suggesting that whatever is inside could help Twilight prove her worth as a princess. Just before he leaves, he returns the friendship journal to Twilight and tells her that he bookmarked some of its more interesting passages. Twilight takes Discord's words to heart and begins searching the old castle library for a means of opening the chest.\n Meanwhile, as Tirek continues absorbing unicorns' magic, Discord appears before him and binds him in chains. Tirek is disgusted to discover that Discord is acting on behalf of ponies, saying \"friendship is but a new form of imprisonment\". He proposes to Discord an alliance and offers to him something better than friendship: freedom. Discord looks behind him to a photo of himself and Fluttershy and ponders.Twilight reads through the friendship journal, focusing on the sections Discord bookmarked, and discovers a pattern. She recalls when Applejack revealed the Flim Flam brothers' deception, Fluttershy showed the Breezies the ultimate kindness, Rarity endured Suri Polomare's schemes, Rainbow Dash chose to fly with Ponyville over the Wonderbolts, and Pinkie Pie overcame her own pride as a party planner. Each of them had to face a situation and make a choice relating to their Element of Harmony, and the ponies affected by their choice gave them a gift. Twilight believes their gifts are connected to the location of the chest's keys.\n The ponies bring the objects\u2014Coco Pommel's spool of rainbow thread, Spitfire's Wonderbolts pin, Seabreeze's flower, Silver Shill's gold bit, and Cheese Sandwich's rubber chicken Boneless\u2014to the chest, but Twilight doesn't see anything special about them. When Pinkie Pie throws Boneless against the chest, a bright light turns him into a key, and he rests inside one of the chest's keyholes. Twilight's friends bring the rest of their gifts close to the chest, and each one becomes a key for one of its keyholes. However, there's still one key missing: Twilight's key.\nBefore the friends wonder where the final key could be, Spike belches out a letter for Twilight, telling her to go to Canterlot immediately.\n Twilight flies to Canterlot and meets with Princess Celestia, Princess Luna, and Princess Cadance in the castle throne room. Celestia informs Twilight that Discord has betrayed them and joined forces with Tirek. She also says that Tirek has gained enough power that he can now steal the magic of Pegasi and Earth ponies as well as unicorns.\nThe princesses surmise that Tirek will go after Alicorn magic next, and once he has it, he will be unstoppable. However, Celestia has a solution: the princesses must rid themselves of their magic before Tirek has a chance to steal it.\n"}, {"summary": "Princess Luna explains to Twilight Sparkle that they must give up their magic before Lord Tirek comes to steal it. Twilight is more than willing to sacrifice her magic as well, but Luna elaborates that their magic can't disappear into thin air; someone has to keep it safe, and Princess Celestia says that someone is Twilight because they believe Tirek doesn't know there's a fourth princess of Equestria.\nTwilight is uncertain, as she is only just learning to control her own Alicorn magic, but Princess Cadance believes she can, as she represents the element of magic itself. Celestia adds that Twilight must keep the magic a secret from her friends or else put them at great risk. With these in mind, Twilight accepts this task, and the other princesses carry out a ritual that transfers all of their magic into Twilight. Elsewhere, Discord picks up on this magical imbalance but thinks nothing of it.\nWhen the transfer is complete, Celestia, Luna, and Cadance are left severely weakened and exhausted, and their cutie marks have vanished.\n Twilight returns to Golden Oak Library in the middle of the night, causing Spike to wake up. As a result of her absorbing the other princesses' magic, Twilight suffers from the occasional magical twitch, and she tries keeping it a secret from Spike. Spike, noting that the sun hasn't come up yet, goes back to sleep. Twilight realizes that the sun should indeed be up by now and uses her magic to (awkwardly) lower the moon and raise the sun.\nBack in Canterlot, Discord and Tirek find Shining Armor, with Shining Armor labeling Discord a \"traitor.\" Once Tirek absorbs his magic and that of the royal guards, Tirek tells Discord to \"go and have a little fun\" while he makes his way to the throne room. Inside, Tirek finds Celestia, Luna, and Cadance but is shocked and infuriated to discover they have no magic for him to absorb.\nIn Ponyville, Twilight struggles to get used to her new power while also keeping them hidden from her friends. After blowing the door off the library and zooming past Rainbow Dash, she tells her friends to keep all the ponies in Ponyville indoors and heads back toward the Castle of the Two Sisters.\n With Celestia, Luna, and Cadance without their Alicorn magic for him to absorb, and in a cruel act of revenge against them, Tirek banishes the three princesses to Tartarus as he once was. As a sign of his gratitude and loyalty to Discord, Tirek gives him a medallion that was given to him by \"someone very close.\" Tirek sees a stained glass window depicting Princess Twilight and realizes that there's a fourth princess living in Equestria. He asks Discord where she is and Discord points him in the direction of Ponyville.\nAfter Twilight's friends secure the other ponies' safety, Discord appears before them and imprisons them in a cage. Realizing Discord's betrayal, Fluttershy is reduced to tears. With the ponies together in one place, Tirek absorbs their magic and grows even more powerful. Discord is thrilled by the prospect of ruling Equestria alongside Tirek, but Tirek says Discord is no longer of use to him and absorbs his magic as well.\nA weakened Discord reminds Tirek of his medallion\u2014his sign of his \"gratitude and loyalty\". Tirek says the medallion was given to him by his treacherous brother Scorpan and considers both him and the medallion worthless. As Tirek leaves to seek out Twilight, Discord is distraught over the same act of betrayal he brought upon Fluttershy and the others.\n Near the ancient castle, Twilight continues practicing her new powers, with some difficulty. When Tirek appears and demands her magic, Twilight desperately avoids him. In the process, at least the aboveground portion of Golden Oak Library is completely destroyed. In rage, Twilight fires upon Tirek with a massive magic blast. Tirek realizes what the other princesses have done, and Twilight battles him in an explosive and destructive duel, able to combat him on equal footing.\nSeeing the two of them are at a stalemate, Tirek offers with Twilight a trade: the release of her friends in exchange for the Alicorn magic. Despite her friends' protests, Twilight agrees to trade the magic for her friends, including Discord. Discord thanks Twilight and apologizes to Fluttershy, and Tirek promptly absorbs all of Twilight's magic, making him almost unstoppable.\nDiscord, repentant of his actions, gives the medallion given to him by Tirek to Twilight as a sign of true friendship. Believing this to be the final key needed to open the chest, Twilight and her friends race to the Tree of Harmony.\n Twilight and her friends return to the chest, where Twilight's medallion turns into the last key. Before Tirek discovers and stops them, the six friends turn the keys at the same time, and the top of the chest opens, releasing a rainbow-colored blast of power that showers them in light. The ponies are transformed and given rainbow-marked coats, manes and tails. They confront Tirek, who is unable to overpower their magic.\nA blast of light strips Tirek of his power, and he is banished to Tartarus once more. Twilight and her friends fly over all of Equestria and return all of the ponies' stolen magic, and the other princesses are freed from their own imprisonment. Finally, the Tree of Harmony launches the chest and its keys toward Ponyville, where it sinks into the ground. Mere seconds later, a great crystal castle rises out of the ground from where the chest landed.\n Twilight and her friends behold the castle's majesty as their rainbow powers wear off, with Twilight wondering who the castle belongs to. Princess Celestia then appears, along with Princess Luna, Princess Cadance, Spike and Discord, telling Twilight that the castle is hers. As they walk through the castle corridors, Twilight finally understands her role as a princess: to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. In recognition of her role, Princess Celestia designates her the \"princess of friendship\".\nIn the castle throne room sit seven thrones, one for Twilight and each of her friends (except for Discord, who Fluttershy tells has yet to deserve one).\n As the ponies of Ponyville gather outside the new castle, Twilight steps out and invites them inside as she and her friends sing an upbeat song. Through the magic of their friendship, a rainbow shoots up from the throne room floor and travels across Equestria, where it is witnessed by Coco Pommel, the Wonderbolts, Cheese Sandwich, the Breezies, Silver Shill, and Discord. In the throne room, Discord is finally accepted by the ponies, and he gives Princess Celestia a bouquet of flowers as a sign of apology, much to her own surprise.\nThe final shot of the finale sees Twilight taking a photo with her friends.\n"}]}, {"season": "5", "eps": [{"summary": " At the Castle of Friendship in Ponyville, Twilight Sparkle wonders about the castle's appearance following the defeat of Lord Tirek. As she and her friends sit in their thrones, their cutie marks begin to glow, causing lights from their thrones to shine upon the star-shaped platform in the center of the room. The castle suddenly comes alive to construct an elaborate holographic map of Equestria.\nFloating images of the Mane Six's cutie marks point toward a location far off from Ponyville, and the six friends believe that the map is beckoning them in that direction. As Spike stays behind to plan a hoofball weekend with Big McIntosh, Twilight and her friends set out on a road trip.\n After riding the Friendship Express to the end of the line, the Mane Six find a village in the middle of nowhere, where all of the houses\u2014with the exception of one\u2014are arranged in two parallel rows. The ponies cautiously approach the village and discover that all of the ponies living in it bear strangely perpetual smiles (which raises Pinkie Pie's immediate suspicion) and have exactly the same cutie mark: a black equal sign.\nAs they enter the village, the Mane Six are warmly greeted by the villagers, much to Fluttershy's delight. Two stallions named Party Favor and Double Diamond meet them personally, noticing that Twilight is an Alicorn princess and that they all have unique cutie marks.\nTwilight asks if there has been any trouble in town lately, of which Double Diamond states there hasn't ever been any. The two stallions decide to take the ponies to meet the village's founder Starlight Glimmer.\n At Starlight's cottage, the Mane Six are introduced to Starlight Glimmer, who happily welcomes any pony that wants to experience what she calls \"true friendship.\" She explains that her village is unique in that no one has special talents. Starlight gives the ponies a tour of the village in a big musical number, during which she explains that harmony in the village in predicated on equality\u2014no one is special, no one argues, and everyone is equal.\nWhen the song ends, Starlight and the villagers invite Twilight and her friends to join their society and give up their cutie marks\u2014a sentiment and philosophy that Rainbow Dash openly mocks. The others are equally skeptical, and Starlight leaves their decision to stay or not entirely up to them. As Double Diamond sees to the Mane Six's needs, Starlight walks away, eager to spread her sinister message of equality to the rest of Equestria.\nAs the six friends continue to take in what the village has to offer, Twilight finds it inconceivable that a pony's cutie mark can be taken away. Rarity is repulsed by their questionable fashions, and Rainbow Dash is uncomfortable with their constant staring; Fluttershy is the only one keeping an open mind.\n The friends sit down for lunch, and a baker named Sugar Belle notices them bickering, asking if their friendship is ending. They explain to Sugar Belle that it's natural for friends to disagree; this, coupled by the Mane Six's unique cutie marks, earns Sugar Belle's interest. She asks them to meet with her in private after they have lunch. Thinking that they're being watched, Twilight and the others have Pinkie Pie eat Sugar Belle's horrible tasting muffins and nonchalantly enter Sugar Belle's house.\nIn Sugar Belle's basement, the Mane Six meet with Sugar Belle, Party Favor, and Night Glider, who express a great interest in the ponies' cutie marks and yearn for their own. When Twilight asks how a cutie mark is taken away, Night Glider explains that Starlight Glimmer removes them with the \"Staff of Sameness\" and stores them in a cavern vault.\n Starlight Glimmer leads the Mane Six outside the village, pleased by their interest in the cutie mark vault. Twilight believes that the castle map brought them to the village in order to return the villagers' cutie marks. Inside a cave, they discover a large collection of cutie marks stored inside glass casings and a two-pronged staff standing upright.\nStarlight asks the ponies how they learned about the vault, and Pinkie Pie inadvertently reveals that a pony in the village told them about it. Realizing that the friends' presence is a threat to her perfect society, Starlight springs a trap on them, and the villagers surround them. Using the Staff of Sameness, Starlight rips the Mane Six's cutie marks from their bodies, replacing them with black equal signs and causing the Mane Six's body colors to fade, and places the cutie marks in the vault.\nWith the ponies now stripped of their talents, Starlight says they'll learn how much better their lives will be without cutie marks.

Because Fluttershy has been the most optimistic about the village since their arrival, her friends decide she is the only one whose pretending will be believed.\n Starlight Glimmer lets the friends out of the house and asks if they are ready to join her society. The Mane Six once again refuse, saying that friendship between ponies cannot be forced. Starlight prepares to lock them up again, but Fluttershy speaks out, wanting to join her. Twilight and the others are locked inside the house, and Starlight welcomes Fluttershy\u2014on one condition: give up the names of the ponies who spoke with her in secret and told her about the cutie mark vault.\nBefore Fluttershy is pressured into outing her new friends, Party Favor speaks up, taking all of the blame and insisting he was acting alone. Starlight Glimmer locks him up with Fluttershy's friends as punishment. Party Favor despairs that it's only a matter of time before Twilight and her friends have all accepted Starlight's way, but they are certain that Fluttershy will come through.\n As Fluttershy's new home is built, she stays in Starlight Glimmer's house in the meantime.

They say nothing, and Starlight prepares to lock them up again. Party Favor is released when he shows remorse for his actions. When Twilight shows interest in joining Starlight's society, Starlight reasserts that happiness can only be found in equality.\nWith this, Fluttershy attempts to expose Starlight's secret by dousing her in water. Starlight avoids getting completely wet, but some of the water splashes on her and causes her makeup to run. Party Favor notices this and uses a rag to reveal Starlight's real cutie mark underneath her fake one, much to the shock of her followers.

Meanwhile, Starlight takes the Mane Six's cutie marks and escapes through a secret passage under her bed.\nWith the villagers' help, the Mane Six break into Starlight's house and follow her through the secret passage. They see Starlight fleeing toward the mountains, through which a network of caves would guarantee her escape and the loss of the Mane Six's cutie marks for good. Using their rediscovered special talents, Party Favor, Sugar Belle, Double Diamond, and Night Glider pursue Starlight Glimmer through the mountains, eventually cornering her just outside the caves and burying her in snow. The jars containing the Mane Six's cutie marks shatter, and their cutie marks are finally restored.\n Twilight and her friends catch up to confront Starlight Glimmer one last time, with Twilight protecting Party Favor and the others from a retaliatory attack from a furious Starlight.

Fluttershy wants to rest up for their pancake breakfast the next day and says Twilight needs to get the castle ready. Twilight insists that the castle is fine and flies off to help Pinkie Pie with the pancakes.\n The next day, the Mane Six have a pancake breakfast together in the dining hall of Twilight's castle. However, a messy-looking Twilight sleeps through the meal, having spent the whole previous evening preparing pancakes with Pinkie Pie. The other ponies have also taken notice of Twilight's recent odd behavior: helping Applejack dig more tree plots than necessary at Sweet Apple Acres; spending an entire afternoon helping Rarity organize a single gem drawer at Carousel Boutique; and racing Rainbow Dash over and over, no matter how many times she'd lost.\nWhen Twilight wakes up from her sleep, her friends ask her what's going on. Twilight explains that she's been avoiding her castle because it's too big, cold, and empty for her to feel like home. Rarity suggests redecorating and even proposes that her friends will do it for her while she spends a relaxing day at the Ponyville Day Spa.

With Twilight still having her spa day, Rarity tells Spike to stall for time and keep her away from the castle until sundown.Spike returns to Twilight at the spa. Before Twilight can leave to go back to the castle, Spike stalls by suggesting massages. While Twilight has a normal massage, Spike inadvertently accepts a much firmer massage from Bulk Biceps. Back at the castle, Twilight's friends begin to argue about which decorations to remove.\n After Twilight and Spike's massages, Spike suggests that they take the scenic route back to the castle. They pass by the blackened remains of the Golden Oak Library and fondly think back on the memories they made while living there. To cheer Spike up, Twilight asks if he wants to add anything to the castle to make it feel more like his home too. Spike thinks of another way to stall for time and says he wants a new bed.\nMeanwhile, as Twilight's friends continue removing the throne room's clutter, they end up returning it back to the way it was before they started. With sunset quickly approaching, the ponies struggle to think of another way to make the castle feel like a home. They realize that they had been decorating as they would their own homes instead of Twilight's home. As they ponder on what Twilight loved about living at the library, Applejack gets an idea.\n In Davenport's Quills and Sofas store, Spike browses for a new bed, and Twilight begins to lose patience. Meanwhile, as they sing a reprise of their earlier song, Applejack and Fluttershy dig up the ground around the library while Rarity, Pinkie, and Rainbow buy decorative gems, eventually hanging something up in the castle throne room.\nSome time later, Twilight and Spike finally return to the castle where the other ponies greet them. At first it appears that Twilight's friends have made no changes to the castle, but Applejack says what truly makes home feel like home isn't what it looks like but the memories you make there.\n With that in mind, the ponies made a chandelier out of the library's roots, decorated it with gems, and hung it in the throne room. Each gem on the chandelier depicts a memorable moment of Twilight's life in Ponyville. Twilight is moved to tears by the gesture and ready to make new memories in the castle. The Mane Six and Spike celebrate with a lavish cake Pinkie Pie made and share it in the newly refurnished dining hall, where Twilight's friends admit to still adding a little flair of their own to other rooms in the castle, much to everyone's amusement.\n"}, {"summary": " In the Cutie Mark Crusaders' clubhouse, Apple Bloom calls a Crusader meeting to order and reveals in a letter from Manehattan that her cousin Babs Seed finally got her cutie mark\u2014a pair of scissors.\nWhile the Ponyville Crusaders are happy for her, they wonder who will run the Crusaders' Manehattan branch in Babs' place. Scootaloo states matter-of-fact that \"she can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if she's already got her cutie mark.\" Sweetie Belle even imagines receiving a cutie mark that one doesn't like. Considering the apple-themed cutie marks in Apple Bloom's family, Scootaloo lists off several negative possibilities for such a cutie mark, making Apple Bloom fraught with worry.\n Apple Bloom's cutie mark-related anxieties persist until nightfall\u2014she worries whether she'll like her cutie mark, what will become of the Crusaders, and if she'll have to leave the Apple family if her cutie mark isn't an apple. As Applejack tucks Apple Bloom into bed, she assures her through lullaby that a cutie mark won't change her no matter what she gets. Comforted by Applejack's song, Apple Bloom drifts off to sleep.\nThe next morning, a well-rested Apple Bloom meets Applejack in the kitchen for breakfast. Once there, the two Apple sisters are shocked to discover that Apple Bloom got her cutie mark\u2014a bug spray can spraying apple mist.

A voice suddenly calls out from the shadows, offering to take Apple Bloom's cutie mark away. Apple Bloom accepts, and a gust of wind erases the mark from her flank. When Apple Bloom returns to Ponyville, the town is in chaos due to a twittermite swarm. Without her pest control cutie mark, Apple Bloom is unable to stop the swarm from destroying Sweet Apple Acres. Upon getting zapped with electricity by the swarm, Apple Bloom wakes up in her bed, relieved to find that the entire ordeal was a dream.

Because of this, Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle no longer consider Apple Bloom a Crusader or their friend, and they kick her out of the clubhouse.\nApple Bloom is suddenly returned to the dark forest, where the voice from earlier speaks to her again. Apple Bloom believes being a blank flank again will keep the Crusaders together, and the voice grants her wish, removing her cutie mark a second time.

Frazzled by her concurrent nightmare, she meets Applejack for breakfast once again. Like before, Apple Bloom has her cutie mark. However, as Applejack, Big McIntosh, and Granny Smith come to realize, Apple Bloom's cutie mark is a dolphin. For having a non-apple-related cutie mark, Apple Bloom is disowned by the Apple family and cast out into the lonesome darkness.\nUpon waking in her bed a third time, Apple Bloom looks in the mirror and is relieved that she doesn't have a cutie mark. As soon as she turns around, however, numerous cutie marks appear on her flank and in the air around her. Hysterical, she runs out of her bedroom and winds up in the dark forest once more.

As she gallops away, Apple Bloom encounters Princess Luna, who reveals that the entity Apple Bloom has been talking to this whole time was her own shadow.\n With Princess Luna's advice, Apple Bloom faces her cutie mark fears and accepts that it doesn't matter what her cutie mark turns out to be. She feels embarrassment for learning such a simple lesson, but Luna assures her that she isn't the only pony with such anxieties. She shows Apple Bloom nightmares that Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo are having\u2014nightmares in which they also receive cutie marks they don't want.\nLuna brings the three together in a dream version of the Crusaders' clubhouse. Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo learn that a cutie mark won't change who they are and that, when they finally do get their cutie marks, they'll fit them perfectly. Wondering if Babs is suffering the same anxieties, the Crusaders decide to send her a care package to let her know that she isn't alone.\n The next morning, Apple Bloom wakes up in her bed. Looking at her bare flank, she sighs in relief that the nightmare is finally over. She meets her family for breakfast and briefly joins in a reprise of Applejack's earlier lullaby.

When the fillies return with rodeo souvenirs, Applejack scolds them for going off on their own.\n As Apple Bloom asks Applejack if she and her friends can compete in some rodeo events, a tall stack of hay bales suddenly tips over, nearly injuring all the ponies present. Sheriff Silverstar finds a horseshoe imprint in the dirt and deduces this to be the work of an infamous outlaw named Trouble Shoes. Upon hearing that Trouble Shoes\u2014wanted for ruining several other rodeos across Equestria\u2014has come to Appleloosa, the townsponies are whipped into a nervous frenzy. Silverstar considers cancelling the rodeo, but refusing to be intimidated, he doubles his security patrols and declares that the rodeo will go on as planned. With a dangerous outlaw on the loose, Applejack almost sends Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo home to Ponyville and even contemplates going with them. However, Braeburn encourages Applejack to stay and compete in the rodeo, and he promises to keep a watchful eye over the Crusaders.\nHours later, after Braeburn has fallen asleep, the fillies sneak out into the woods to find Trouble Shoes. Apple Bloom and Scootaloo reason that, with Trouble Shoes behind bars, they'll be able to compete in the rodeo and get their cutie marks. Despite her uncertainty about the idea, Sweetie Belle goes along with them. Unfortunately, the fillies quickly become lost, and it starts to rain.\n Braeburn informs Applejack about the Crusaders' disappearance, and the two go to alert Sheriff Silverstar, worried that Trouble Shoes abducted them. Silverstar, his deputies, Applejack, and Braeburn set off into the rain to find the missing fillies.\nMeanwhile, Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo\u2014still lost in the woods\u2014find a seemingly abandoned mobile cabin and use it to take shelter from the pouring rain. Suddenly, they're visited upon by a large shadowy figure. They scream in fear, startling the figure into clumsily knocking into things and falling over. The Crusaders' would-be assailant turns out to be a tall yet unassuming Earth pony stallion.\n The Crusaders soon realize that Trouble Shoes means no harm and that he's only a victim of bad luck, indicated by his cutie mark of an upside-down horseshoe. He tells the fillies to leave before his bad luck spreads to them, but when they admit they don't know the way back to Appleloosa, Trouble Shoes offers to lead them there.The Crusaders wonder why Trouble Shoes, having a reputation as an outlaw, is being so nice to them, and Trouble Shoes tells them the story of how he got his cutie mark.\n When he was a colt, Trouble Shoes wanted to be a rodeo star but kept publicly embarrassing himself in his attempts. During his audition for rodeo school, he got his cutie mark and humiliated himself in front of the judges. Though he abandoned his dreams, Trouble Shoes still liked to watch the rodeo, but his bad luck caused mishaps every time. Since then, he's considered bad luck to be his \"lot in life.\"\nThe Crusaders realize that Trouble Shoes has been looking at his cutie mark all wrong and that he could still make a name for himself as a rodeo clown. However, before they could share this revelation with him, Sheriff Silverstar appears with the others to place him under arrest.\nThe next day, the Crusaders plead Trouble Shoes' innocence to Applejack, but she refuses to listen because of his supposed abduction of the fillies the night before. She leaves to compete in the rodeo's hay bale stacking event. At the sheriff's office, the Crusaders lure Silverstar away and free Trouble Shoes from his jail cell, saying that they're going to help him live his dream.\n On the rodeo grounds, after Applejack wins the hay bale stack, the rodeo clowns take the field. The Crusaders encourage Trouble Shoes\u2014wearing clown clothes and makeup\u2014to join them. Trouble Shoes is certain his cutie mark represents bad luck, and the Crusaders assure him that it doesn't have to. With their encouragement, Trouble Shoes joins the other clowns. Despite his usual clumsiness, his antics are met with laughs and positive reception.\nDuring his performance, Trouble Shoes accidentally reveals his identity to the crowd, and the ponies of Appleloosa quickly turn on him. The Cutie Mark Crusaders stand up for him, asserting that his past mistakes were just accidents, and some of the ponies admit that he is a talented clown. Trouble Shoes apologizes for all the trouble he's caused and agrees to take responsibility for it.\n The Crusaders admit that Trouble Shoes wasn't responsible for abducting them the previous night. As punishment for wandering off on their own again, Applejack has them clean up the rodeo grounds. Though they are returning to Ponyville as blank flanks, the Crusaders do feel pride for helping Trouble Shoes realize what his cutie mark really means."}, {"summary": " At Fluttershy's cottage, Fluttershy and Discord enjoy an afternoon of tea and funny stories. Fluttershy looks forward to introducing him to her new friend Tree Hugger\u2014the mention of whom Discord becomes visibly bothered by\u2014as well as the upcoming Grand Galloping Gala. When she mentions the Gala, Discord assumes that she is inviting him as her plus-one, but Fluttershy says she already invited Tree Hugger.\nDiscord is upset by this news, having not received a ticket to the Gala himself, but he plays it off as he leaves the cottage.\n Discord goes to the Castle of Friendship looking for Twilight Sparkle\u2014frightening Spike in the process\u2014but learns that she's away in Canterlot. At Carousel Boutique, Rarity makes Gala dresses for Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo, who Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash have respectively invited as their plus-ones.

Down the street, he notices Fluttershy walking with Tree Hugger and goes to introduce himself. Jealous of Fluttershy's new friend, he quickly excuses himself to leave.\n In another, bizarre dimension, Discord returns home to keep himself occupied as he vents his frustrations. Outside, a hapless mailpony floats through with a delivery for Discord: a ticket to the Gala that arrived late because the mailpony got lost along the way. Discord is thrilled that he was invited to the Gala after all and wonders who to bring as his guest. As the Gala gets underway, Princess Celestia thanks Twilight for helping with the Gala planning and preparations. The sound of a trumpet announces the arrival of Discord and his guest: a green, slimy creature called the Smooze. Its appearance\u2014and appetite for shiny objects\u2014startles several of the other Gala guests. Twilight pulls Discord aside and warns him to keep the Smooze under control.\nSeeing Fluttershy and Tree Hugger at a ballroom table, Discord interrupts their conversation in an attempt to irritate Tree Hugger, but his attempt fails due to her mellow demeanor. So focused on making Fluttershy jealous, Discord is unable to keep the Smooze from causing havoc around the Gala; as it eats jewels off of Rarity and other guests' dresses, the Smooze slowly grows in size. Discord eventually ditches the Smooze by locking it inside a room, unaware that the room holds a large collection of jewels and shiny valuables.\nDiscord continues trying to get Fluttershy's attention by doing a stand-up comedy routine, but it is poorly received. Before long, the Smooze, now of immense size, escapes the room he was locked in and covers the Gala floor in slime. The other guests break into a panic, and Twilight and Celestia are unable to bring the situation under control with their magic.\n Tree Hugger reasons that the Smooze's \"senses are agitated\" and manages to calm him down with soft vocalizing. The Smooze releases the ponies from its slime, and the ponies cheer for Tree Hugger. Fed up, Discord rips open a portal to another dimension, intending to banish Tree Hugger there, but Fluttershy angrily tells him to stop. Discord accuses Fluttershy of abandoning him in favor of Tree Hugger, but Fluttershy argues that just because she didn't invite him to the Gala doesn't mean they aren't friends and that one can have different friends for different reasons.\nDiscord takes this lesson to heart, returning the Smooze to normal size and apologizing to Tree Hugger for his actions.\n As the Gala gets back to normal, Discord also apologizes to the Smooze for ignoring it all evening, and Pinkie Pie invites the Smooze to dance. Twilight apologizes to Princess Celestia as well for the almost ruined Gala, but Celestia is in good spirits, revealing that she invited Discord to liven the Gala up.

Before heading out, Pinkie entrusts Gummy with the baking.\n At the Castle of Friendship, Twilight Sparkle is excited that the map is calling Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash to the griffon kingdom of Griffonstone. Though Twilight has become a bit of a griffon history buff, Rainbow is less than enthusiastic because of the way Gilda treated her friends during her visits to Ponyville.\nAccording to Twilight, the griffon kingdom has a rich history centered around an ancient treasure called the Idol of Boreas. She expresses disappointment that the map is not summoning her to Griffonstone, but she is confident that Pinkie and Rainbow can solve whatever problem the kingdom has on their own.\n After a train ride on the Friendship Express, Rainbow and Pinkie climb the mountains to Griffonstone, following a written guide that Twilight gave them. Upon arriving, they find the supposedly majestic kingdom to be a small, shabby-looking town with impolite citizens. They encounter Gilda, who still bears a grudge toward them, and the elderly griffon Grampa Gruff.\nGrampa Gruff explains\u2014for a few bits\u2014that Griffonstone was once a grand city of proud and united griffons thanks to the Idol of Boreas. But sometime during the reign of its most recent king, a monster named Arimaspi attacked and stole the idol. The idol was eventually lost when Arimaspi fell into the Abysmal Abyss, and Griffonstone fell into a state of misery.\nRainbow Dash believes that she and Pinkie were sent to Griffonstone to find the Idol of Boreas and restore the kingdom's pride and glory. Despite Gilda's indifference about the idol, Pinkie goes to the Griffonstone library while Rainbow plans an expedition into the Abysmal Abyss.\n As Rainbow Dash is forced to deal with money-hungry griffons, Pinkie Pie finds the library to be just as much a shambles as the rest of the city. She chats with a very embittered Gilda and discovers, to her dismay, that the kingdom doesn't have singing, a party store, or a bakery. All it has is griffon scones, which Gilda sells to make a living, but they taste terrible, so Pinkie offers her services.\nWhen the distracting smell of their baking causes a griffon named Greta to fall out of the sky, Gilda helps her up. Pinkie Pie notices this and sees a good side in Gilda, but Gilda insists that no one is friends in Griffonstone. As she laments having had a friend once, Pinkie remembers Rainbow Dash and goes looking for her.\n Meanwhile, as Rainbow goes spelunking into the Abysmal Abyss, her rope snaps, stranding her on an Abyss ledge with a sprained hoof. Unable to fly out because of the harsh ravine winds and out of bits to pay her griffon guide for assistance, Rainbow cries out for help. Pinkie soon hears her calling out and goes back to town to get help from Gilda. As Gilda continues to bake, Pinkie Pie comes to her for help in rescuing Rainbow Dash. Gilda is uninterested in the woes of a former friend, but Pinkie tells her to remember a time when the two were friends.\nGilda recalls her first day at Junior Speedsters flight camp as a shy griffon fledgling.

When Rainbow's ledge breaks and she falls deeper into the Abyss, Pinkie nosedives to save her, inadvertently dragging Gilda along. Pinkie grabs Rainbow, and Gilda grabs another ledge as they dangle from the rope. On a ledge next to hers, Gilda finds the long lost Idol of Boreas. She reaches out to grab it, but Pinkie is slowly losing her grip on Rainbow. Just before the ponies go plummeting, Gilda pulls them up to safety, sacrificing the idol to the Abysmal Abyss.\nGilda apologizes to Rainbow and Pinkie for the way she'd treated them. While Rainbow accepts the apology, she laments that Griffonstone will never be restored without the Idol of Boreas. However, Pinkie believes they were sent to Griffonstone not to recover the idol but to replace it with something better: friendship. With friendship, the kingdom could be made grander than before.\n Pinkie and Rainbow encourage Gilda to befriend Greta by offering some freshly-baked griffon scones, which appears to go well. When Pinkie and Rainbow's cutie marks start glowing, they realize their job in Griffonstone has been accomplished. They entrust Gilda with spreading friendship around the kingdom, and Rainbow assures Gilda that they'll visit again soon.\nPinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash set off for home, with Pinkie wondering how Gummy is coming along with the baking.

It attacks Fluttershy with a monstrous Angel, rots Applejack's prized apples, turns Rainbow Dash's favorite dream of fighting changelings into a sickeningly cute flower field, and assaults Twilight with bat-like books. It escapes Luna's pursuit each time until the Mane Six finally wake up from their nightmares.\nMuch to Princess Luna's shame, the Tantabus remains on the loose. Luna regrets causing ponies more suffering even after her actions as Nightmare Moon, but Pinkie assures her that everyone makes mistakes. Luna says she can stop the Tantabus as long as it remains confined to the Mane Six's dreams, but due to Pinkie dreaming about the rest of Ponyville, the entire town is now exposed to the Tantabus' reach.\nWith a whole town of dreams to infect, the Tantabus grows more powerful and gets even closer to breaching the real world. Twilight proposes giving everyone in Ponyville the same dream to keep the Tantabus confined in one place. Luna is reluctant to create a shared dream that large, but she counts on the Mane Six's support. The ponies and Spike go back to sleep, and Luna extends her magic over all of Ponyville, causing everyone to experience the same dream.\n Within moments, the Tantabus appears to attack the dreaming ponies. Princess Luna attempts to fend it off, but most of her magic is spent keeping the dream stable. The Tantabus attempts to break out of the dream and into the real world. The Mane Six recruit the other ponies' help and fight off the Tantabus and its forces through methods only possible in a dream. Fluttershy turns into Flutterbat, Big McIntosh turns into an Alicorn, Spike turns into a lance-wielding knight with Derpy as his steed, and Rainbow and Applejack turn into Zapp and Mistress Mare-velous, respectively. Using the power of the dreamscape, Scootaloo, Filthy Rich, and Twilight assist in the fight as well.\n Despite the town's efforts, however, Princess Luna's guilt causes the Tantabus to grow to immense size. Luna tearfully reveals that she herself created the Tantabus to punish herself with nightmares after the suffering she inflicted as Nightmare Moon. Realizing that the Tantabus is feeding off of Luna's guilt, Twilight and her friends rally around her, telling her to forgive herself.\n With her friends' help, Luna finally moves on from her past. As the Tantabus loses its strength and shrinks in size, Luna draws it back into herself before it can escape the dream world. The next morning, the Mane Six wake up feeling well-rested. Luna, however, is fast asleep in the middle of the room, dreaming peacefully. The episode ends with Luna in a restful sleep on a bed of grass, surrounded by colorful flowers and a waterfall.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Rarity eagerly expecting a letter to arrive in the mail.

Dejected even further, Rarity continues making Princess Dresses as before, sacrificing her \"rules of Rarity\" and creativity.\nAs soon as Rarity completes two hundred Princess Dress orders, Sassy Saddles enters with a hundred more. Despite the success of Canterlot Carousel, Rarity is miserable, but Sassy is too caught up in the fame, even briefly taking credit for the whole boutique. Rarity finally puts her foot down, saying if this is what success in Canterlot looks like, she wants no part of it. She also declares that she is closing Canterlot Carousel and demands that Sassy make flyers for a going-out-of-business sale.\n Rarity gets rid of the Princess Dresses and puts the other dresses she made on display. When the sale begins, she sees how much the customers like the dresses and decides not to close the boutique. Finally realizing what the \"rules of Rarity\" mean, Sassy apologizes to Rarity and prepares to leave.

After some pressing\u2014and through Rarity's feminine charms\u2014the guards eventually admit that they took a short break when someone left them a very specialized cake. Rarity and Rainbow track the cake's origin to a Canterlot cake shop. The owner Cinnamon Chai tells Rarity that whoever purchased the cake had concealed their identity, except for having a deep, raspy voice and wearing a scarf that got stained in chocolate.\nRainbow Dash becomes increasingly worried when all the clues point to her and frustrated by Rarity's constant diversions to talk about fashion, but Rarity is confident her investigation is leading them toward the true culprit.\n Back at the performance grounds, the Wonderbolts have yet to locate Spitfire.

Rarity's accusation appalls Rainbow, but Rarity explains her case:\n In the face of this overwhelming evidence, Wind Rider confesses to sending Spitfire the fake note, saying he did it to preserve his long-distance speed record. He states that sometimes playing dirty is necessary to win, but Soarin and the rest of the Wonderbolts disagree and scorn him.

Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle come over to invite Apple Bloom to cheer on Scootaloo, who is participating in the social with Rainbow Dash even though they aren't related.

The judges interrupt their celebration, stating that while they have knowingly turned a blind eye towards Big Mac's disguise, they must disqualify him and Apple Bloom for his destructive and unsportsmanlike behavior in the race. Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo are declared the winners while Apple Bloom bitterly leaves with Big Mac.\n Back at Sweet Apple Acres, Apple Bloom finds Big Mac sitting alone by a tree, assuring him she is no longer upset since she and Applejack can still participate in the next Sisterhooves Social. She asks why he wanted to win so badly, but Big Mac refuses to talk about it. As Apple Bloom prepares to leave, Big Mac finally speaks up and admits that he wanted Apple Bloom to look up to him like she used to as a filly, before Applejack became \"the hero of the Apple family\".

As their behavior puzzles Twilight, they depart.\n Twilight and Spike, still confused by Rainbow Dash and Discord's behavior, wander into Carousel Boutique to pick up some books that Rarity is donating to the library. Discord appears again, this time accompanied by Fluttershy. Once again, Discord shares in some inside jokes with Twilight's friends, leaving her out of the loop.\nFluttershy says they would've invited Twilight to hang out with them, but they didn't want to interrupt her book-sort-cation. While Twilight appreciates their consideration, she is put off by her friends having such a big laugh with Discord that she isn't a part of.\n As she continues making her way through town, Twilight ponders on the weekend her friends had with Discord. Spike suggests that she might be jealous for being excluded, but Twilight dismisses it. At Sugarcube Corner, Twilight and Spike find Discord yet again, having fun with Applejack and Pinkie Pie. Excluded from their inside jokes like before, Twilight once again feels uncomfortable. Back at the castle, Twilight is disappointed about having missed out on such a fun weekend. But when Spike again suggests she might be jealous, Twilight says that, as the princess of friendship, she is incapable of jealousy. She reasons that since her friends and Discord are suddenly so close, their experiences over the past three days could help her with her princess duties.\nTwilight gathers her friends together in the park to learn about what they did with Discord over the past several days, in hopes of advancing her friendship studies. But when the ponies try to explain their inside jokes, they are unable to recall the events with completely accuracy, insisting that Twilight had to be there in order to understand.\n To this end, Twilight attempts to recreate the events of their moments together, down to the tiniest detail. However, despite her scientific approach, Twilight fails to understand what makes their inside jokes funny. Discord suggests that Twilight herself is the problem by trying to forcibly include herself in events that she originally wasn't a part of. He explains that moments of bonding between friends cannot be recreated, but Twilight's friends say she will have other opportunities to share in their merriment.\nUnable to figure out why her friends are so close with Discord, Twilight concludes that Discord must have placed a spell on them. She goes to Zecora and explains the situation. Though Zecora is uncertain that magic is at play, she gives Twilight a potion to dispel its effect on her friends.\n The next morning, Twilight assembles her friends in the castle throne room and tries to get them to drink the potion. The ponies insist that Discord's magic had nothing to do with the fun they had together, but Twilight believes she knows better. Fluttershy is appalled that Twilight would accuse Discord of such a thing, and when Pinkie Pie drinks the potion, it has no effect.\nWhen Discord arrives and Twilight's friends continue to laugh at their inside jokes, Twilight erupts in anger, deeply upset for not being included in her friends' fun weekend.\n Twilight's friends explain to her that, even though she is the princess of friendship, it's okay for her to be jealous about being left out as long as she admits it. Discord reveals that he intentionally left Twilight out of her friends' weekend, insisting that he did not want to interrupt her weekend and that her becoming jealous was an unexpected side effect of his actions.\nWhen Discord tells his inside jokes again, the ponies don't find them funny anymore, and now Twilight has her own inside joke with her friends that Discord isn't a part of. As Discord now begins to feel left out, Twilight approaches him with no hard feelings, and he brings the friends together in a group hug.\n"}, {"summary": " At her cottage, Fluttershy gathers her animal friends together for their \"furry friends book club\".

However, both sides are vehemently against a truce, and the Hooffields start firing tomatoes at the McColts.\n Twilight and Fluttershy return to the Hooffields' farm just as the McColts start to return fire with bales of hay, putting the nearby animals in more danger. The two go back and forth between the opposing clans to find out how their feud first started, but neither side gives a clear answer. All the Hooffields and McColts care about is winning the fight, regardless of what they're fighting for.\nFluttershy thinks that one side simply needs to apologize to the other. To this end, the Hooffields deliver a large carrot cake to the McColts as a sign of goodwill. The McColts are almost ready to accept the Hooffields' apology, but a group of Hooffields suddenly emerge from inside the cake and assault the McColts with fruit. The feud continues to escalate, and the two sides bring their conflict to the valley between their mountain homes.\n As little animals continue to get caught in the middle of the Hooffields and McColts' feud, Twilight despairs at her failure to end the conflict. Fluttershy briefly speaks with the cold and hungry animals, and she learns what happened to the once-beautiful Smokey Mountains and why the Hooffields and McColts are fighting.\nUsing a long-range freeze spell, Twilight gets the two sides to stop fighting long enough for Fluttershy to explain. She tells the two warring clans of their ancestors Grub Hooffield and Piles McColt, who were best of friends. When they discovered the beautiful Smokey Mountain valley, they vowed to protect and preserve it for the animals that lived there.\n Unfortunately, they disagreed on the best way to do that. Grub wanted to start by planting crops, but Piles wanted to start by building a shelter. Piles started building his shelter on the land where Grub was going to start his farm. As a result, the two continually argued and sabotaged each other's efforts. The Hooffields and McColts eventually settled onto opposing mountaintops, and the valley and animals between them suffered due to their constant fighting.\nWhen the regretful Hooffields and McColts finally realize what their feud has done to the land around them, they put aside their differences and apologize\u2014both to the animals and to the ponies they were fighting against.\n The Hooffields and McColts work together to restore the valley to its former glory, culminating in a large water fountain dedicated to their ancestral founders.

Apple Bloom suggests they do what their cutie marks symbolize: helping other ponies find out or rediscover what makes them special.\nThe Crusaders travel around Ponyville to find ponies with cutie mark-related problems\u2014from Big McIntosh to Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake to Mayor Mare\u2014but all of the ponies they meet appear to be perfectly content with their special talents and lives. As the Crusaders start to question how special they truly are, they encounter Bulk Biceps, who says he has a cutie mark problem.\n The Crusaders invite Bulk back to their clubhouse\u2014despite the cramped space\u2014and he explains that his cutie mark is a dumbbell, but he has lifted every dumbbell in Ponyville. When they suggest he find other things to lift, he asks what to do after that. The Crusaders then suggest that he teach other ponies to lift things, and this quickly satisfies him.\nApple Bloom worries that there aren't many ponies in Ponyville with cutie mark problems and those that do have problems are too easily solved. Because of this, she wonders if the Cutie Mark Crusaders have any reason to exist.\n The Crusaders take stock of their situation\u2014too few ponies to help and easily solvable cutie mark problems\u2014and Apple Bloom proposes expanding their search to all of Equestria. Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo believe that's too much for them to handle and they should instead focus on helping ponies in Ponyville. Until then, they can just do things for fun without the pressure of getting their cutie marks.\nThe three fillies try out several activities around town, such as scootering and singing, but they find it difficult to think of something they are all interested in. Despite Apple Bloom's reservations, the three decide to pursue separate interests. Suddenly on her own, Apple Bloom tries to find something fun to do, all while singing a heartfelt ballad. Unfortunately, she can't, particularly because she doesn't have Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo to do it with.\n For a brief time, Apple Bloom discovers an interest in dancing in a class taught by Hoofer Steps, and she substitutes for a shy student named Tender Taps. Due to her lack of dancing talent, however, she struggles to fit in. As Apple Bloom leaves, she talks with Tender Taps, who has a lot of tap-dancing talent but suffers from stage fright.\n Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo return to the Crusaders clubhouse after an afternoon of fun spent crocheting and bungee-jumping. Inside the clubhouse, they find Apple Bloom sitting alone in the dark. After trying dozens of activities and failing to find anything that interests her, Apple Bloom despairs about finding happiness now that she and her friends don't hang out anymore. Scootaloo corrects her by stating they can still hang out, but they don't have to do everything together.\nApple Bloom admits that she did like dancing, but she wasn't very good at it. Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo tell her she doesn't need to be good in order to have fun. When Apple Bloom mentions Tender Taps and his performance troubles, Sweetie Belle asks if he had his cutie mark.\n At the Ponyville dance theater, the Crusaders find Tender Taps backstage, and Apple Bloom tries to convince him to perform. When Tender Taps expresses fear from performing in front of an audience, Apple Bloom says she'll perform with him so he'll look good by comparison.\nWhile Sweetie Belle provides them with costumes and Scootaloo assists with the stage backdrop, Apple Bloom and Tender Taps perform a tap-dancing act together. Apple Bloom mostly embarrasses herself, but Tender Taps manages to overcome his stage fright and impress the audience with his dancing. As the ponies cheer for him, he earns a tap-dancing cutie mark.\n Tender Taps thanks the Cutie Mark Crusaders for helping him realize his tap-dancing potential. He tells Apple Bloom that he hopes she continues dancing, and Apple Bloom says she will. Apple Bloom apologizes to her friends for being so silly about them trying new things on their own, and Sweetie Belle says by doing so, they'll be three times as likely to find ponies to help.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode opens with Rarity mining for gems in an underground cavern, with Spike serving as her gem basket holder and \"bodyguard\". Rarity wishes to collect gems without waking up a sleeping colony of bats. Unfortunately, Spike unexpectedly starts glowing, much to Rarity's fear. As he scratches himself uncontrollably, the bats wake up and swarm over him and Rarity. As Twilight Sparkle, Princess Celestia, and Princess Luna enjoy a relaxing get-together at the Castle of Friendship, Rarity storms in with Spike, who moans over his glowing and burning scales. Celestia and Luna explain that this phenomenon is the \"call of the Dragon Lord\", indicating that the Dragon Lord is beckoning all dragons to the Dragon Lands, and that the only way to stop the glowing is to answer the call.\nRarity is nervous about Spike journeying to the Dragon Lands after their past encounter with Garble, so Spike asks Twilight and Rarity to go with him. Twilight eagerly accepts, excited about the prospect of learning more about dragon culture and customs. Considering how dangerous the Dragon Lands are to ponies, Celestia warns the three to be cautious.\n In the rocky heart of the Dragon Lands, Spike arrives to a large assembly of dragons\u2014with Twilight and Rarity disguised as a large rock. Spike also meets Garble again, who is just as arrogant and condescending toward ponies as the last time they met.\nThe current Dragon Lord Torch and his daughter Princess Ember appear before the dragons. Torch tells them it is time for him to step down and a new Dragon Lord to be chosen in a competition called the Gauntlet of Fire. The competition is a treacherous race to claim a bloodstone scepter from a volcano.\n With the call of the Dragon Lord answered, Spike stops glowing. Since he has no desire to be Dragon Lord, he starts to leave, but Dragon Lord Torch stops him. When Princess Ember notes how small Spike is compared to the other dragons, Torch begrudgingly allows him to drop out of the competition. However, when Ember expresses a desire to compete herself, Torch forbids it.\nSome of the dragons discuss their plans for when they become Dragon Lord. Garble in particular intends to get revenge on the ponies who crossed him before, saying they will \"take what [they] want and burn the rest.\" Realizing how much danger Equestria would be in if any of the competitors win, Spike decides to enter the Gauntlet of Fire and win it himself, even if being crowned Dragon Lord means he has to stay in the Dragon Lands.\n In the first leg of the Gauntlet, the competitors are tasked with navigating water geysers and flying toward the volcano island. Because Spike doesn't have wings, he is forced to swim to the island. When one of the competitors falls into the water and sinks, Spike saves them from drowning and carries them to the island. This competitor is revealed to be Princess Ember in disguise, determined to show her father that there is more to being a leader than strength and size.\nWhen Ember discovers Twilight and Rarity hanging around Spike and that they are his friends, she is disdainful, saying \"dragons don't do friends.\" When Garble approaches and picks up the ponies' scent, Ember keeps him from discovering them. In return, Spike keeps Garble from discovering Ember's true identity. He also proposes that they work together to navigate the Gauntlet's obstacles. Rarity is uncertain about teaming up with Ember, but Spike believes she can be trusted.\n Hesitantly, Ember agrees to team up with Spike, and together they navigate the obstacles to the next leg of the Gauntlet. Realizing that she only made it this far with Spike's help, Ember decides to work together with him a little longer. Through their teamwork, they make it through a tunnel of stalagmite and crystal traps. As Twilight and Rarity congratulate them on making it through, Spike saves Rarity from falling into a lava pool. Ember asks why Spike would risk everything to save her, and Spike says \"that's what friends do\". Because of their differences in philosophies, Ember decides to end her partnership with Spike and navigate the rest of the Gauntlet of Fire by herself.\nAs Spike, Twilight, and Rarity continue through the maze-like volcanic tunnels, Spike is dejected by Ember's sudden abandonment. Though Rarity believes it to be for the best, Spike is still convinced that there is good in Ember.\n After walking for some time, Spike and his friends make it to the center of the volcano, where the bloodstone scepter waits to be claimed. Unfortunately, Garble is right behind him. Before he drops Spike into a rock pit, Ember swoops in to Spike's rescue, admitting to herself that the two of them are indeed friends. While Ember holds off Garble, Spike goes to retrieve the scepter.\nSpike claims the bloodstone scepter just as the rest of the dragons arrive, bringing the Gauntlet of Fire to a close. For his first act as the new Dragon Lord, Spike commands Garble to go home and hug every dragon he passes along the way. He soon passes the scepter on to Ember, however, saying she will make a great leader and protect the ponies of Equestria as well as he would have.\n Torch is outraged to discover that his daughter participated in the Gauntlet of Fire against his wishes, but Ember rebuts by saying it takes more than being big and strong to be Dragon Lord. Torch thus apologizes for underestimating his daughter's abilities, and Ember is officially recognized as the new Dragon Lord.\nAs Spike, Twilight, and Rarity make their way back home, Twilight commends Spike for not only protecting Equestria but also gaining it a new ally. Thanks to this adventure, Twilight has permission to write letters to Ember with questions about dragon culture, and Rarity is inspired to make a new line of camouflage-themed clothing.\n"}, {"summary": " At the Castle of Friendship, Twilight Sparkle tries to give Starlight Glimmer another friendship lesson that involves setting a dinner table without using magic.

Starlight argues that Twilight should place trust in her student just as Celestia placed trust in hers, and Twilight hesitantly agrees.\nWhile Trixie sets up her stage, bypassing ponies give her distrustful looks, giving her doubts about the value of second chances. Having overheard what Twilight said about her at the castle, Trixie says she understands if Starlight doesn't want to be her friend.

Desperate to salvage the evening, Twilight goes looking for Starlight, eventually finding her about to go onstage with Trixie.\nTwilight confronts Starlight about missing the dinner and being friends with Trixie, revealing that she doesn't completely trust her. Trixie reveals that she partly became friends with Starlight just to beat Twilight at something. Despite Trixie telling her that she got carried away, Starlight is convinced that no one wants to be her friend, and she runs off in tears. Trixie attempts to play it off, but Twilight notices that she is distraught over driving her only friend away.\n Trixie puts on her show as planned, but her delivery is flat and unenthusiastic as a result of her falling out with Starlight; regardless, she intends to go through with the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive.

She realizes she was wrong about Trixie and encourages Starlight to make her own decisions.\nAt the very climax of Trixie's magic trick, Starlight returns to make it a success, and the audience loudly cheers. As the two take a bow, Trixie introduces Starlight as her \"great and powerful assistant and best friend\".\n Backstage, Trixie and Starlight reconcile with a hug.

Rarity begins her interview with high hopes, but her friends express how much of an ordeal it was.\nThe episode flashes back further to Rarity and her friends walking through Manehattan's \"Saddle Row\", a street lined with numerous famous boutiques and where Rarity For You is located. With the inside of the boutique a dusty shambles, Twilight wonders if it will be ready for the grand opening that evening, but Rarity remains ever hopeful.\n However, a number of additional problems arise. Rarity's pushy landlord Mr. Stripes arrives and strong-arms her into giving his daughter Plaid Stripes\u2014who lacks business experience\u2014a job in the boutique. In addition, a family of raccoons has taken up residence in one of the boutique's back rooms, and the upper floor is home to DJ Pon-3's noisy dance club.

She explains to the two about her troubles bringing Applejack out on a spa day and how extra busy Applejack is lately with her chores. They meet Applejack at the farm, and Applejack expresses how sorry she is about her chores taking up all of her time. She even adds that Apple Bloom, Big McIntosh, and Granny Smith are unable to lighten her workload due to having chores of their own.\nWith this in mind, Twilight offers to help on the farm with Spike so Applejack and Rarity can have their spa day. Applejack is reluctant at first, but she soon gives in and grants Twilight and Spike one hour to complete one chore: feeding the pigs. She gives them a detailed step-by-step checklist on how to carry out the task.\n As Applejack and Rarity make their way to the spa, Applejack worries a little about Twilight and Spike's ability to handle farm work, but Rarity assures her that they can handle an hour's worth.\nUpon arriving at the spa, the two discover Rainbow Dash about to have her own spa treatment\u2014though Rainbow desperately tries to play it off. Unfortunately for all three ponies, service at the spa is backed up. Despite Applejack's excitement for having a relaxing steam, the wait line for the steam room is considerably long. Aloe explains this is because the steam room has been taking longer to fill with steam lately, causing the spa to start providing customers with hot towels.\n Using her labor expertise, Applejack traces the low steam problem to a pipe leak. The leak causes low steam pressure, leading to a longer wait time for the steam room, and providing customers with hot towels uses up the spa's hot water that would normally be used to create steam, thus forming a never-ending cycle. Unwilling to leave things as they are, Applejack steps in to fix the dilemma, despite only the hour of time she and Rarity have before returning to the farm.\nThanks to Applejack's efforts, the spa is once again at quality efficiency, and the employees even have less loads of laundry to do. However, Applejack and Rarity have no more time left for their spa day.

They arrive to the sight of Twilight and Spike dangling corn over the pigpen, as was stipulated in the checklist Applejack provided them with. Applejack takes over for the two and admits that a list doesn't always convey the proper method of doing something.\nAs Rarity voices her disappointment in the spa day she and Applejack had, Applejack does a series of bizarre steps in order to feed the pigs, such as opening and closing the pen gate, babbling crazily at the pigs, and clucking like a chicken. While doing this, she expresses the sentiment of one getting stuck in a routine that puts extra, unnecessary work on oneself.\n When Applejack's friends question her method for feeding the pigs, she explains that each step serves a purpose in addressing a possible problem. However, as Applejack herself points out, she had solved these problems long ago and therefore fell into her own unbreakable routine. With her friends' help, Applejack manages to streamline her chores and cut out the unnecessary steps through which she does them, thus giving her more free time. With the extra free time given to her, Applejack decides to have a real spa day with Rarity, and she very much looks forward to an afternoon of relaxation.

He returns to Fluttershy's cottage later with a zapped mane, Rainbow having made good on her promise. With this string of failures behind him, Zephyr Breeze gives up.

When they approach, he tries to convince them that he's doing well, but he eventually wallows in his continuous failures. Fluttershy tells Zephyr that he could do anything with his talents and intelligence if he simply tried. Zephyr admits that he's so afraid of failing, it's easier to not try at all, especially given his own sister's success as a hero of Equestria.\nFluttershy allows Zephyr Breeze to come back with her as long as he does exactly what she says, and Zephyr agrees, eager to not have to live in the forest. Back at the cottage, Fluttershy and Rainbow encourage Zephyr\u2014through song\u2014to continue pursuing mane therapy.

Twilight Sparkle notes that the Cutie Map has not sent her or her friends on any friendship missions since Starlight used it to travel back in time. Luckily, through Twilight and Starlight's collaborative research, they have found a spell to get it working again.\nUsing their magic, Twilight and Starlight reactivate the map. Almost immediately, it summons Pinkie Pie and Rarity to Canterlot, causing Rarity to get overexcited.\n Upon arriving in Canterlot, Rarity recommends starting their search for a friendship problem at the castle, but Pinkie proposes that they simply \"go with the flow\" and let a friendship problem find them. When Pinkie's stomach growls, Rarity suggests they begin with lunch, and she takes Pinkie to Canterlot's \"Restaurant Row\", home to some of Equestria's most renowned establishments of fine dining.\nAs Rarity points out, most of the restaurants in the area have a \"three-hoof rating\" given by famous food critic Zesty Gourmand, whose opinion can make or break a restaurant's success. However, several of Rarity's restaurant choices offer poor-tasting food and nearly identical atmospheres.\n Pinkie decides to choose the next restaurant, and she follows a delicious aroma to a small yet non-rated restaurant called The Tasty Treat. Inside, they meet chef Saffron Masala, who offers them some very tasty dishes. Saffron's father Coriander Cumin, however, is ill-tempered due to the restaurant's lack of business. As a result, he and his daughter have a strained relationship, and they frequently argue.\nPinkie Pie and Rarity believe this is the friendship problem they have been summoned for: to save Saffron and Coriander's restaurant and tense relationship. Rarity offers to use her connections in Canterlot to bring Zesty Gourmand, and Pinkie offers to help advertise.\n A short while later, Rarity informs Saffron and Coriander that she successfully convinced Zesty Gourmand to visit The Tasty Treat. Unfortunately, Zesty is only available that very evening, giving Pinkie and Rarity only a few hours to get the restaurant ready.\nRarity helps Coriander Cumin make the restaurant worthy of a three-hoof rating, and Pinkie and Saffron Masala drum up business in the streets. Through a Bollywood-style duet, Rarity convinces Coriander to make his restaurant just like the other establishments on Restaurant Row while Pinkie Pie tells Saffron Masala to embrace what makes The Tasty Treat unique and special.\n After several hours, Pinkie and Saffron only manage to convince a tourist couple from Whinnyapolis to visit The Tasty Treat. When they return to the restaurant, they discover that Rarity and Coriander have redecorated to make it resemble every other restaurant on the block, even copying their unappetizing menus. As Pinkie and Rarity argue over their conflicting creative directions, Zesty Gourmand arrives.\nWith Zesty's three-hoof rating looming over them, Coriander and Saffron\u2014and by extension, Rarity and Pinkie\u2014argue over what food to serve. Their escalating disagreements cause a bowl of curry to spill on Zesty. After some harsh words for both Rarity and the restaurant, Zesty angrily takes her leave.\n Having failed in their friendship mission, Pinkie and Rarity apologize to Coriander for ruining his restaurant. In an effort to cheer her father up, Saffron serves him a dish he used to make when she was little. The two reminisce on old times, and Saffron expresses that all she has ever wanted to do was serve food to ponies that they used to make together.\nAs Coriander and Saffron reconcile, Rarity realizes that Zesty Gourmand's opinion doesn't matter. She believes she and Pinkie can fix things by switching their previous roles; Rarity brings in the crowd while Pinkie returns The Tasty Treat to how it was before.\nThrough Pinkie and Rarity's efforts, The Tasty Treat is reverted to its former, more unique state, and numerous ponies show up for its \"grand re-reopening\".

As Zesty brushes off their opinions and leaves, Pinkie and Rarity's cutie marks glow to signify a mission success, and the celebration inside The Tasty Treat goes on.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Daring Do braving an underground temple's hazards to claim a rare artifact. This is revealed to a Daring Do story being read to Rainbow Dash by Twilight Sparkle while Rainbow packs up for the Daring Do Convention in Manehattan. Twilight is upset that she is unable to attend the convention due to an upcoming friendship summit in Griffonstone, but Rainbow promises to get A.K. Yearling to sign her book for her.\nRainbow tries to downplay her excitement for the convention in front of Twilight, but she is overcome with excitement as soon as she arrives.\nAs Rainbow Dash wanders through the convention, a salespony briefly tries to sell her on the Daring Do Experience \"adventu-cation\", but she declines, having already done it. Afterward, she meets a pony named Quibble Pants, who shares her fanatical passion for Daring Do. The two spend some time exploring the convention together and checking out various booths and activities.\n During lunch, Rainbow suggests they check out convention activities relating to the Daring Do books that were released after the initial trilogy. Quibble refuses, however, claiming that the later books in the series are \"dumbed down\" and unrealistic. This leads to a heated argument between Rainbow and Quibble regarding the quality and realism of A.K. Yearling's subsequent writing, and Rainbow is unable to properly defend her points without revealing that Daring Do is a real pony.\nUnable to come to an agreement on the matter, the two decide that they cannot be friends and part ways.\nAt the hotel near the convention, Rainbow Dash searches for A.K. Yearling so she can prove to Quibble Pants that the Daring Do books are indeed realistic. When she meets with Yearling claiming to have an \"emergency\", Yearling pulls her into a hotel room, believing that Dr. Caballeron is somewhere at the convention. Yearling dismisses Rainbow's fan interests as she is more concerned with a key-shaped artifact she recently came into possession of and finding a lost treasure before Caballeron does.\n Discarding her A.K. Yearling persona, Daring Do asks Rainbow Dash to keep a lookout for suspicious activity around the convention hall. As Rainbow returns to the convention, Dr. Caballeron lurks close by, blending in with cosplayers as he searches for Daring Do. Rainbow once again bumps into Quibble Pants, who continues to voice his distaste for the later Daring Do books.\nAs Rainbow follows Caballeron and Quibble Pants follows her, Caballeron's henchponies overhear them talking about Daring Do's artifact and capture them.\n Caballeron and his henchponies drag Rainbow and Quibble out to a remote jungle, believing them to be working for Daring Do and intending to use them as bait to draw her in. However, Quibble believes the entire setup to be fake\u2014that Rainbow Dash signed them up for a Daring Do Experience adventu-cation and that Caballeron and his henchponies are merely actors.\nAfter the henchponies bind Rainbow and Quibble in chains, Quibble uses his intricate Daring Do savvy to lure the henchponies away and free himself and Rainbow. However, he still refuses to acknowledge that anything happening around him is real. Rainbow guides Quibble through the treacherous jungle, and it is only after Quibble nearly falls into raging rapids that he realizes his life is in genuine danger. Unfortunately, Caballeron and his henchponies quickly catch up with them, and through their unwitting help, Caballeron discovers the lost temple he had been searching for.\n Caballeron and his henchponies drag Rainbow and Quibble into the temple, and Quibble still believes everything happening around him to be a performance. As he continues to voice his cynicism, he inadvertently triggers some traps that releases a monstrous Cipactli and slowly fills the temple chamber with mud. Once he is face-to-face with the Cipactli, Quibble comes to a frightening realization:\nCaballeron traps Rainbow and Quibble in the mud chamber with the Cipactli, but Daring Do swoops to their rescue. Quibble is eager to escape the temple, but Daring Do says they have to find the treasure before Caballeron first.\n Rainbow, Quibble, and Daring Do find themselves in a chamber with seven doors, behind only one of which lies the treasure. With Quibble Pants' cynical help, Daring Do opens the correct door with her key-shaped artifact and claims the temple's treasure. However, as mud starts to fill the room, the temple entrance is sealed off and the Cipactli slowly closes in.\nUsing a vine to pull Quibble Pants along, Rainbow and Daring Do avoid the Cipactli and escape the temple through an open skylight. Once the three are outside the temple, they elude Caballeron and his henchponies by having the Cipactli chase them off.\nDaring Do thanks both Rainbow Dash and Quibble Pants for their help and flies off to bring the temple treasure to a museum.\n As Rainbow and Quibble return to civilization, Quibble admits that the later Daring Do books are more realistic than he realized, but he still does not like them. Before Rainbow can argue with him again, Quibble says he figured something out. While he prefers the intelligent and puzzle-solving Daring Do of the original trilogy and Rainbow prefers the brave and unbeatable Daring Do of the later books, it is okay for them to like the series in their own way, and neither of them are at fault for their personal preferences.\nQuibble also compliments Rainbow Dash for the bravery and awesomeness she demonstrated during their adventure. Rainbow returns the sentiment, complimenting Quibble for his perception and puzzle-solving skills. As they leave the jungle as friends, Quibble goes on an extended ramble about his Daring Do fan fiction that continues over the end credits.\n"}, {"summary": " At the Ponyville Schoolhouse, Miss Cheerilee announces to her class of foals that she is going to teach them about physics in order to prepare them for the upcoming Applewood Derby, in which the school foals will each build and race their own carts on a racetrack with an older pony assisting and riding with them.\nCheerilee explains that cart racers will be awarded ribbons based on three categories: fastest cart, most traditional cart, and cart with the most creative design.\nLater, when school is dismissed, Sweetie Belle researches old Applewood Derbies and wants to win first place for most traditional cart. Apple Bloom says that although the Derby is closely linked to Apple family history and they usually win the most traditional award, she wants to win the fastest cart award. Lastly, Scootaloo states she wants to win the most creative cart award as a change of pace from her high-speed scootering. The three fillies decide to seek help from their older sisters.\n At Rainbow Dash's cloudominium, Rainbow agrees to help Scootaloo build her cart, having fond memories of winning her own derby as a filly in Cloudsdale. However, she over-eagerly puts some of her own ideas to work as she goes to search for her own cart's blueprints. Similarly, Applejack favors a traditional cart over Apple Bloom's desire for a modern and fast cart, and Rarity takes charge of making Sweetie Belle's cart to make up for previously losing a first place \"Most Creative\" ribbon to Derpy.\nVery early the next morning, Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash take their little sisters to Sweet Apple Acres to start building their derby carts.

In spite of the Crusaders' continued frustration at being left out of derby activities, they ride in the carts with their older sisters. Cheerilee, dressed in a derby cheerleader outfit, signals the start of the race, and Applejack and Apple Bloom are left far behind due to the outdated design of their traditional cart.\nAs ponies race down the track, spectators sing a rousing song to cheer the racers on. Though their sisters excitedly sing along, the Crusaders have no fun in their roles as cart passengers. During the race, Rarity's cart blocks the other carts from passing. Near the finish line, Rainbow Dash's cart loses a tire, and the intersecting layout of the racetrack causes all of the carts to crash into each other.\n The Crusaders finally vent their frustrations to their older sisters, saying they were supposed to design and drive their own carts in the Derby and that the older ponies ruined things for everyone due to their selfishness. When asked why they did not say anything earlier, the Crusaders say it's hard to speak up to ponies older than them and they figured ponies who participated in the Derby before knew what was best.\nApplejack, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity apologize to the Crusaders for getting carried away and ignoring their feelings. They also convince Cheerilee to agree to a second Applewood Derby to make up for the first\u2014with the condition that the older ponies stay on the sidelines.\n The three older sisters help the Crusaders build their carts exactly how they were initially envisioned; providing the help that was originally desired.

Suddenly, a monstrous-looking creature appears in the shadows before them, causing them to flee and cower in terror. When the creature comes out of the shadows, it is revealed to be Rainbow Dash in disguise, pulling a prank.\nThough Rainbow is very amused by her own prank, Fluttershy finds no humor in it at all because she was scared. Rainbow Dash claims that Fluttershy is scared too easily, and when Fluttershy denies it, Rainbow scares her yet again just by saying the word \"boo\".\n The next day, the Mane Six gather in the Castle of Friendship throne room to discuss Rainbow's pranking habits. When Rainbow says her pranks are just harmless jokes, the others\u2014except for Pinkie Pie\u2014argue that they are not harmless if the party being pranked is not amused. During this discussion, Rainbow pranks Twilight Sparkle with a whoopee cushion in her throne. Similar to the night before, Rainbow and Pinkie Pie laugh, but Twilight does not.\nRarity makes the argument that if Rainbow Dash cannot put forth the effort to pull off a prank that everyone can enjoy, she might as well not pull off any pranks at all. Rainbow perceives this as a challenge and leaves the castle to plan more pranks.\n Later that day, Rarity enters her workshop to put the finishing touches on Sweetie Belle's uniform for the upcoming Filly Guide Cookie Drive. Inside, she finds the uniform standing atop a giant cake\u2014with a note attached that reads \"You asked for it.\" Expecting a booby trap by Rainbow Dash to be set off if she tries to retrieve the uniform, Rarity attempts to make a brand new uniform, but she finds her sewing machine has been replaced with a sewing machine-shaped cake.\nThat night, Applejack sets up bells, pots, wind chimes, and other noisemakers around her bedroom in case Rainbow tries to prank her in her sleep. These preventative measures fail, however, as Applejack wakes up the next morning in the pig pen. Over the course of the rest of the day, Rainbow Dash pulls similar pranks on Cranky Doodle Donkey, Spike, Big McIntosh, Mr. Cake, and Cheerilee\u2014pranks that are funny only to Rainbow herself.\n The ponies go to Pinkie Pie and inform her of Rainbow Dash's endless string of unfunny pranks. Though Pinkie herself has already been pranked and found it funny, the rest of Ponyville think Rainbow Dash is getting too carried away. Because Pinkie shares Rainbow's love of pranks, the ponies ask her to tell Rainbow to stop, much to Pinkie's discomfort.\nPinkie approaches Rainbow Dash at her house, but before she can tell her to stop pranking ponies, Rainbow shares her plans for her biggest prank yet. She plans to replace all the cookies being sold during the Filly Guide Cookie Drive with joke cookies that give everyone who eats them \"rainbow mouth\", causing their mouths and teeth to turn rainbow colors. Unable to see much humor in such a prank, Pinkie tries to convince Rainbow to stop pranking for a little while, but Rainbow refuses.\n Some time after replacing the Filly Guide cookies, Rainbow goes to Sugarcube Corner and finds Pinkie Pie sick in bed with rainbow mouth and craving more cookies. She tries to pull Pinkie out of bed so she can see the results of Rainbow's prank, but Pinkie is too weak to move...\nWith Applejack and Rarity's help, the Cutie Mark Crusaders prepare to begin their cookie drive. Rainbow Dash arrives to help out too, and Applejack warns her not to do anything that could potentially ruin the fillies' night. Rainbow promises to behave herself.\n The Crusaders then spend several hours selling cookies door-to-door until almost all of their boxes have been sold. Rainbow Dash eagerly waits to see the results of her prank, but she notices that all of Ponyville has gotten eerily quiet. She flies around town looking through ponies' windows and sees cookies and cookie boxes scattered everywhere, but there are no ponies in sight.

Pinkie Pie, Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake also appear exhibiting similar behavior.\nAs Rainbow flies out of the bakery and across town, she sees other ponies with rainbow mouth also acting like zombies and craving cookies, including her friends. She races back to Applejack, Rarity, and the Crusaders before they too fall victim to this plague and beckons them to find a hiding place. Before long, the zombified ponies catch up, and Rainbow and the others flee in terror.\n Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Rarity, and the Crusaders board themselves up inside the barn at Sweet Apple Acres, intending to wait until the effects of the cookie zombie plague wear off. However, the zombified ponies quickly surround the barn and pound at the doors and windows. Rainbow reveals to the others that she replaced the Filly Guide cookies with joke cookies as a prank, but she didn't intend for this to happen.\nUnfortunately, Rarity, Applejack, and the Crusaders have already eaten the joke cookies and have now turned into zombies as well, making Rainbow the only non-zombie left. The rest of the zombies break into the barn and close in on Rainbow. As she is backed into a corner, she admits that her prank was supposed to be funny, but this is not funny at all. With Rainbow's admission, the ponies suddenly drop the charade, having been only acting like zombies until now.\n Applejack reveals that, after Rainbow told Pinkie of her plan to prank the whole town, Pinkie orchestrated the fake zombie plague to teach Rainbow a lesson. Because Rainbow doesn't see the humor in this prank, she realizes how she has been making everyone else feel with her own pranks.

After the events of Cadance and Shining Armor's wedding, they are taking all necessary precautions, especially since changelings feed on love and the Empire is filled with more love than anywhere in Equestria ever since the Crystalling.

Since then, he has lived on his own in search of friends with which to share love, but his basic changeling instincts prevent him from venturing out into public.\nHaving a reputation among the Crystal Ponies as a hero, Spike offers to speak to them on Thorax's behalf.\n Spike returns to Shining Armor and the royal guards and says that he not only found the changeling but also befriended him. Unfortunately, the ponies are so disdainful toward changelings that they consider such a feat to be impossible and that Spike's ramblings are merely a joke.\nSpike returns to Thorax's cave to give the bad news, but he comes up with another plan. He brings Thorax to the castle under the guise of an average Crystal Pony and introduces him to Twilight as his pen pal \"Crystal Hoof\". After a successful meet-and-greet with Princess Twilight, Spike takes \"Crystal Hoof\" out in public to mingle with other Crystal Ponies.\n A short while later, Spike and Thorax return to the palace to meet with Princess Cadance and the others. As the disguised Thorax is openly welcomed, Cadance introduces him to Flurry Heart. However, the love coming from all around her causes Thorax to succumb to his basic changeling instincts, and he inadvertently drops his disguise.\nThe ponies immediately turn on Thorax, believing that he has taken \"Crystal Hoof\"'s place.

Thorax runs away in tears, and the royal guards give chase.\nAs Shining Armor and the royal guards search for Thorax, Spike looks for him in his cave. Thorax comes out of hiding and hisses at Spike, giving up hope that a changeling can ever have friends.

As the princess of friendship, she officially extends a warm hoof to Thorax, which he tearfully accepts. Having received the message of Spike's song, Cadance extends her hoof to Thorax as well on behalf of the Empire, and Shining Armor apologizes for not getting to know him and welcomes him as an official citizen.\n As representative of the changelings, Thorax looks forward to learning all he can about friendship and bringing that knowledge back to the Changeling Kingdom so that changelings can learn to share love among themselves instead of stealing it from others.\nAs the ponies cheer for Spike and Thorax, Starlight echoes Twilight's sentiment from the train: friendship lessons can happen anywhere."}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Fluttershy packing her bags for a trip away from Ponyville.

In order to prepare the two for the upcoming game, Applejack and Rainbow put them through rigorous training.\n Rainbow Dash compels Fluttershy to run an elaborate obstacle course, and Applejack tosses softballs at Pinkie to kick into goal baskets. The intensity of the training and Rainbow Dash's drill sergeant-like coaching cause Fluttershy to frequently trip up. When Applejack piles onto Pinkie the pressure of not letting Ponyville down, Pinkie gets so overwhelmed that she cannot make successful goal shots anymore. Snails, on the other hand, remains perfectly calm and collected as he practices catching balls in the goal.\nApplejack and Rainbow Dash are surprised by Fluttershy and Pinkie's sudden lack of talent after the skills they demonstrated earlier. Reasoning that they just need some rest, the two coaches call it a day and tell them to rest up for the next day's buckball game. On their way home, Pinkie and Fluttershy confide in each other about their worries of letting their friends down. However, they take relief in the fact that very few ponies in Ponyville have even heard of buckball...\n...until numerous ponies show up at the train station to cheer for the Ponyville team and see them off to Appleloosa.\n After their big send-off at the train station, Applejack, Rainbow, Fluttershy, and Pinkie ride the Friendship Express to Appleloosa. Fluttershy and Pinkie's anxieties are made even worse when Applejack mentions that Ponyville is planning a parade for their return and Rainbow suggests the possibility of a commemoration by Princess Celestia. Unable to deal with the overwhelming pressure of disappointing their friends, Fluttershy and Pinkie confess to Applejack and Rainbow that they don't want to play buckball anymore, and they run away upset.\nApplejack and Rainbow come to realize that they focused so heavily on what made the game important to them that they ruined what made it fun for Fluttershy and Pinkie. After finding the two hiding in the train's luggage car, Applejack and Rainbow tell them that they don't have to play against Appleloosa and that they will take their places instead. However, because they have not had any practice themselves, they ask Fluttershy and Pinkie to play one practice game against them before the game against Appleloosa starts.\n On a buckball field near Appleloosa, Applejack and Rainbow have a practice game against Fluttershy, Pinkie, and Snails. With the pressure of letting Ponyville down no longer on their shoulders, Fluttershy and Pinkie are able to play much better. Applejack and Rainbow reveal that their \"practice\" was set up to help show how amazing Fluttershy and Pinkie are when they have fun, and apologize for putting the two under so much stress to win. When Fluttershy and Pinkie still worry about letting their friends down, Snails advises them to simply not think about it \u2013 an approach that they eagerly agree with.\n Some time later, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, and Snails play against Braeburn's team in buckball, and the score is tied five-to-five. When Fluttershy and Pinkie worry about winning, their friends remind them not to think about it and just have fun. In the final seconds of the game, Fluttershy and Pinkie manage to score a point and win the game.\nBraeburn commends the Ponyville team for playing such a good game and resolves to get serious for their rematch. Fluttershy and Pinkie tell him not to get too serious, however, as the secret to good buckball is just having fun.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode opens with the Cutie Mark Crusaders visiting a mother and father in Ponyville. While Scootaloo keeps the filly Petunia Paleo busy in the backyard sandbox, Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle speak with her parents, who are concerned about the \"unsettling nature\" of their daughter's new cutie mark: a skull and two bones.\nAfter Scootaloo helps Petunia unearth a dinosaur skeleton in the sandbox, Petunia's parents are relieved that their daughter is an archaeologist and not a pirate as they had initially feared.\nLater that day, the Crusaders make their way through Ponyville, proud of the many cutie mark problems they have helped other ponies with, such as Bluenote, Bulk Biceps, and Tender Taps. On their way to their clubhouse, Sweetie Belle wonders if they will ever encounter an unsolvable problem when Apple Bloom spots a griffon perched atop the clubhouse. The fillies are alarmed since griffons are usually unfriendly and short-tempered. But when the griffon sees them, she greets them with a big, enthusiastic hug.\n The griffon introduces herself as Gabriella\u2014or Gabby for short. Having heard about the Crusaders solving cutie mark problems around Ponyville, she says she has been searching for them in order to get a cutie mark of her very own.\nInside the clubhouse, Gabby explains to the Crusaders that she has always felt out of place among the more antisocial griffons while working as a mail courier in Griffonstone. When Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash visited Griffonstone, Gabby observed them teaching Gilda about friendship and was convinced that their cutie marks were related to their desire to help others. So when Gilda needed a letter delivered to Rainbow Dash in Ponyville, Gabby jumped at the opportunity. She met with several ponies around town that the Crusaders helped and sought the fillies out so they could help her find her true purpose in life and get her own cutie mark.\n The Crusaders are at a loss as they have never heard of a griffon getting a cutie mark, but Gabby remains optimistic. While she goes to deliver Gilda's letter to Rainbow Dash, the Crusaders consult Twilight Sparkle at the Castle of Friendship for advice. However, not even Twilight has any knowledge of creatures other than ponies who can get cutie marks, and she reminds the fillies that using magic to make a cutie mark appear is never a good idea.\nThe Crusaders decide to tell Gabby that, while it is unlikely she will ever get a cutie mark, they can still help her find her purpose in life. Unfortunately, Gabby misinterprets them to mean that getting a cutie mark is guaranteed and becomes more ecstatic than ever. Even after the Crusaders explain to her what Twilight told them, Gabby maintains that it is not impossible.\n Scootaloo sympathizes with Gabby because of her own difficulties of achieving flight and promises to help her realize her dream of getting a cutie mark, much to Gabby's delight. Using a chart to map out various possibilities for Gabby's purpose, the Crusaders lead her in song as she seeks out other ponies struggling with their own problems.\nGabby demonstrates great aptitude for a variety of activities, but her cutie mark shows no signs of appearing. The Crusaders come to realize that Gabby is good at so many things, singling out her special talent is truly impossible. When they tell Gabby the harsh reality that they she will never get a cutie mark, she flies off in tearful denial.\n As the Crusaders wallow in their first failure at solving a cutie mark problem, Gabby bursts into the clubhouse and reveals that she earned her cutie mark after all. She shows off her cauldron cutie mark and reasons that, since helping Zecora brew potions was the first thing she tried, that must be her special talent. The Crusaders are elated and decide to tell Twilight the good news. However, Gabby suddenly becomes nervous at this suggestion and promises to meet the Crusaders at Twilight's castle after delivering Rainbow Dash's reply letter to Gilda.\nThe Crusaders go to the castle to inform Twilight about Gabby's cutie mark, but Twilight tells them that Gabby left them a note before quickly departing. As the Crusaders read Gabby's note aloud, in which she thanks the fillies for helping her earn a cutie mark, Twilight excitedly drops everything to research the first cutie marked griffon in history. Realizing that Gabby broke her promise, the Crusaders become suspicious and go to find her.\n The three find Gabby helping Dr. Hooves get his cart out of a mud puddle. When she trips and falls in the mud, her cutie mark is revealed to be fake. Gabby apologizes for lying about getting her cutie mark and admits that she did so to cheer up the Crusaders after they failed to help her. Before she leaves for Griffonstone in shame, Scootaloo gets an idea and tells her to meet them at the clubhouse.Later at the clubhouse, Gabby wonders that since she cannot get a cutie mark, she may not have a purpose in life. However, the Crusaders tell her that she does have a talent for helping others in need, even the Crusaders themselves. Gabby says that helping others is just something that she enjoys, and the fillies tell her what makes her talent special is what she enjoys doing most, which she doesn't need a cutie mark for.\n In recognition of her talent, the Crusaders give her a makeshift cutie mark in the form of two mailbag clips modeled after their own marks. With this, they welcome Gabby as the first griffon member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders.\nSome time later, all of Ponyville throws Gabby a cute-cea\u00f1era to celebrate her cutie mark. Immensely grateful to the Crusaders for their help, Gabby promises to share what they taught her with the rest of Griffonstone, and the Crusaders tell her to come back soon.\n"}, {"summary": " At the Castle of Friendship, Applejack and Fluttershy are alarmed to learn that the Cutie Map is calling them to Las Pegasus, a city reputed for being a wild vacation spot with loud noises and large crowds. Twilight Sparkle assures her friends that the Cutie Map would not have chosen them for this mission if they were not the perfect candidates.\nApplejack thinks the city will not be as bad as she believes, but when she and Fluttershy arrive, they find it to be even noisier and more crowded than they imagined.\nAt a Las Pegasus luxury resort filled with games and carnival rides, Applejack and Fluttershy are overwhelmed by all the excitement and activity, believing that Pinkie Pie or Rainbow Dash would be more suited to such an environment. Applejack suggests they solve the friendship problem they were summoned to solve quickly so they can return home. As they explore the resort, they hear a barker pony promoting an event called Pone Fantastique and crediting the event's sponsoring to the owner of the resort, Gladmane.\n Gladmane himself appears to greet Applejack and Fluttershy, pleased to meet the friends of Princess Twilight Sparkle. Calling himself a \"friendship connoisseur\", Gladmane credits the success of his resort to friendship and hard work. He offers to give the two a tour of the resort, and they accept so they can find the friendship problem they were called to solve.\nIn a backstage area, Applejack and Fluttershy meet several performers in Pone Fantastique, including a trapeze artist, the trapeze artist's director, and a pair of exotic animal trainers. The ponies they meet have nothing but praise and admiration for Gladmane.\n At the end of the tour, Applejack and Fluttershy are surprised to find that everyone in Las Pegasus gets along very well. All of a sudden, they hear the familiar voices of Flim and Flam promoting Pone Fantastique. However, while Flim promotes the event's acrobatics act, Flam promotes the exotic animal act, and the two appear to be on sour terms. Fluttershy believes this is the friendship problem they were called for, but Applejack vehemently refuses to help them.\nGladmane explains to Applejack and Fluttershy that Flim and Flam have been arguing ever since they arrived at his resort. While he compliments Flim's showmanship and Flam's business sense, Applejack says they are better apart than together. Fluttershy suggests they help Flim and Flam, but Applejack still refuses and leaves to find other ponies with friendship problems.\n Fluttershy speaks with Flim and Flam one-on-one and learns they had a falling-out over harsh words and a disagreement in business direction. Fluttershy tries to get them to reconcile their differences, but they refuse to even speak to each other. Meanwhile, Applejack discovers other arguments being had between the Pone Fantastique performers. A stagehand and one of the animal trainers state that the arguments between them prevent them from finding greater success outside of Gladmane's resort.\n Applejack and Fluttershy meet up later in the resort cafeteria and share their surprise in finding three friendship problems in the same place. They also realize that the ponies' arguing only serves to benefit Gladmane\u2014as long as they argue, they are forced to stay at his resort and make him money. However, when they talk to the performers about Gladmane's possible double dealings, the performers deny such claims and only praise the resort owner further.\nApplejack and Fluttershy's suspicions about Gladmane are confirmed when Fluttershy speaks with the animals featured in Pone Fantastique: Gladmane deliberately causes arguments between the show performers in order to keep them working for him. But because he does it behind the ponies' backs, they remain ignorant to his deceit. Applejack wonders how to expose Gladmane's lies, and Fluttershy proposes they fight trickery with trickery by getting help from Flim and Flam.\n Despite Applejack's reluctance, she and Fluttershy decide to help Flim and Flam reconcile. However, Flim and Flam do not believe their claim that Gladmane drove them apart. When asked precisely how they started fighting in the first place, Flim explains Gladmane told him that Flam thinks he is just a mouthpiece with no good ideas. Similarly, Flam heard from Gladmane that Flim thinks he has zero business sense. However, each brother's only proof that the other said such things is based on what Gladmane told them.\nApplejack and Fluttershy assert that Gladmane keeps them apart in order to keep them from taking over his resort. Realizing that Applejack would never lie about such a thing, Flim and Flam agree to help them expose Gladmane's lies.\nFollowing Flim and Flam's plan, Fluttershy disguises herself as wealthy pony \"Impossibly Rich\", with Flam posing as her guide. Flim informs Gladmane that Impossibly Rich is scouting locations to build a resort of her own and cut in on Gladmane's business. Feeling threatened, Gladmane enters to give Impossibly Rich a tour and asks Flam to meet him later in his office.\n In Gladmane's office, Gladmane shares with Flam his intentions to own multiple resorts on the Las Pegasus resort strip and the threat that Impossibly Rich poses to such plans, revealing his crooked side. Later, as Gladmane shows Impossibly Rich around the resort, she and Flam try to get him to reveal the true, dishonest secret to his success using a microphone that Applejack and Flim have set up. Unfortunately, Gladmane sees through their ruse and laughs as he walks away.\nLater, Applejack and Fluttershy confront Gladmane in his office directly and tell him to stop exploiting ponies' disagreements to his own ends. However, Gladmane gloats that his duplicitous form of friendship will soon bring all of Las Pegasus under his control, and that, as a professional conpony, he is always one step ahead. Unfortunately, Fluttershy had her hoof pressed on Gladmane's loudspeaker button the entire time he was talking, revealing his true nature to everyone in the resort.\n The Pone Fantastique performers reconcile their arguments and subsequently quit as Gladmane's employees, ruining his business and reputation. Applejack and Fluttershy's cutie marks start to glow, indicating a successful friendship mission, and they realize it was Applejack's history with Flim and Flam and Fluttershy's inclinations toward kindness that helped them see it through.\nWith Gladmane no longer managing the resort, Flim and Flam quickly step in to take over, much to Applejack and Fluttershy's frustration.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins at the Castle of Friendship in the early morning. Twilight Sparkle prepares to quiz her pupil Starlight Glimmer with a full day's worth of magic spells to perform, including rapid teleportation to multiple locations, object transfiguration, and magic shields.\nStarlight excels at her magic studies with Twilight, even using advanced spells to go incredibly fast and duplicate herself. However, Twilight points out that Starlight hasn't addressed any friendship lessons since she befriended Trixie. Becoming uneasy, Starlight says she will find the time to tackle some between her \"many commitments\". Twilight says now is the perfect opportunity since she and Spike are expected in Canterlot to give a presentation at Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns. She suggests that Starlight complete a friendship lesson before they return later that evening.\n Though Starlight outwardly insists that it will be no problem, her unease around Twilight \u2013 and later Spike \u2013 indicate otherwise. In her castle bedroom, she has several friendship problems planned out: baking with Pinkie Pie, scrap-booking with Applejack, sewing with Rarity, helping animals with Fluttershy, and \"chillaxing\" with Rainbow Dash.\nA short while later, after Twilight and Spike have left, Starlight Glimmer gathers the rest of the Mane Six at the castle to carry out her friendship lessons with them. Applejack advises Starlight to take her time with her lessons, but Starlight is certain she can handle it as long as they work as a team.\n She assigns Pinkie Pie to the kitchen, Applejack and Rarity to the library, and Fluttershy and her animals to the castle foyer. However, Rarity has reservations about sewing in a dusty environment, and Fluttershy's animals each require specific habitats. In addition, Rainbow Dash suggests \"specific conditions for optimal chillaxing\", and Applejack has over eighty moons' worth of photos to scrapbook. Starlight is overwhelmed by the taxing requirements of the friendship lessons before her, and she retreats to the library.\nAs she worries about completing her lessons in time for Twilight's return, Starlight decides to use magic to lighten her stressful workload. Using the Fiducia Compelus spell in conjunction with Cogeria and Persuadere, she brings her friends under her direct control.\nWith the ponies now under her control, Starlight directs them to the locations in the castle that she originally assigned them to, and they follow without question or hesitation. First, she bakes in the kitchen with Pinkie Pie, and Pinkie simply follows Starlight's orders in a cheerful, stilted tone. In the library, Rarity and Applejack exhibit identical behavior, doing whatever Starlight tells them to do, and Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash do the same in the foyer.\n As time goes on, however, Starlight grows bored of Applejack's long-winded stories, Rarity takes Starlight's orders too literally while sewing clothes, Pinkie Pie makes a large mess in the kitchen, and Fluttershy gets carried away in her animal care by bringing together all of the spiders and snakes in the castle. To make matters worse, Starlight accidentally fills the castle with smoke when she leaves the cakes in the kitchen oven unattended. Starlight commands Rainbow Dash to get water, and she responds by bringing storm clouds into the castle and causing a flood.\nJust as Starlight Glimmer thinks the situation could not get any worse, Twilight and Spike return from Canterlot to behold the big mess in the castle.\n As Twilight and Spike clean up Starlight's mess, Starlight tries to figure out what went wrong with her spell. She believes she did not cast it correctly or reverse its effects earlier than she was supposed to, but Twilight and Spike agree that she is missing the point.\nWhen asked how things got as out of control as they did, Starlight admits that she has been deliberately avoiding her friendship lessons. Though she excels greatly at magic, she feared failing such simple tasks as baking with Pinkie or sewing with Rarity and thus letting Twilight down. However, Twilight points out that the purpose of her friendship lessons is to get to know other ponies better, not to complete tasks as baking or sewing.\n At the Ponyville Cafe, the rest of the Mane Six are left suffering from hangover-like fatigue by the lingering effects of Starlight's magic. When Starlight approaches them, they express how upset they are at Starlight using her magic to mind-control them. Starlight accepts the consequences of her actions and offers her sincerest apologies to her friends. Before she leaves, the ponies see how genuinely sorry she feels. They offer to help her clean up the mess she made at the castle and give her a second chance for them to have fun together.\n Over the course of the day, Starlight spends time with each of Twilight's friends, getting to know them better while Twilight supervises. She fixes up the castle tapestries with Rarity, listens to Applejack's family anecdotes, helps Fluttershy find a home for the castle spiders, and bakes with Pinkie Pie. As she finishes tidying up the castle, Starlight says it may be a while before she tries addressing any friendship problems, but Twilight says she has been doing so all day without realizing. The only task that remains is \"chillaxing\" with Rainbow Dash.\nStarlight Glimmer, Mane Six, and Spike conclude their day by lounging together on the castle roof, and Twilight commends Starlight for completing another friendship lesson. As Starlight asks how long they need to \"chillax\", the eight friends share a laugh.\n"}, {"summary": "Twilight Sparkle races to the Ponyville train station, eager to greet Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie when they return from their boat trip at Seaward Shoals. She mentions to Spike that the trip was an opportunity for them to \"get out of their element\"\u2014to try something new. Just in case the three talk over each other out of excitement to share the details of their trip, Twilight gives Spike a scroll and quill to take notes.\nAs the Friendship Express pulls into the station, Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie step out with sour faces and disheveled manes and covered in mud and seaweed. When a surprised and nervous Twilight asks them how their trip was, the three do nothing but pile out of the train and walk off in separate directions.\n In an effort to get Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie to talk out their apparent disagreements with one another, Twilight organizes a tea party at the Castle of Friendship. When there's a knock at the door, Twilight expects her friends to enter, but their pets, Winona, Opalescence, and Gummy enter instead. Each pet offers a letter or message to Twilight saying that each of her invited friends refuse to attend a tea party that the other two are also attending.\nTwilight decides that if her friends will not come to her and explain what happened on their boat trip, she will go to them instead.\nTwilight and Spike start at Carousel Boutique, where Rarity is still combing the seaweed and crabs out of her mane and bemoaning the ruined state of her overcoat. Twilight\u2014after giving Spike his scroll and quill again\u2014asks Rarity what happened on the boat trip, and Rarity explains that \"it all started at the docks\".\n In a flashback, Rarity meets with Applejack and Pinkie Pie at the Seaward Shoals docks, having planned a surprise cruise for the three of them to help get them out of their element. However, while Pinkie Pie remains the same in Rarity's retelling, Applejack strangely exhibits the appearance and characteristics of a salty seafaring captain. When the three get out onto the open sea, Rarity treats her friends to a tray of fancy dishes and hors d'oeuvres such as cucumber sandwiches, and Pinkie Pie offers assorted sugary treats. Rarity offers a cucumber sandwich to Pinkie Pie, before she can try it, Applejack tosses the entire tray of food overboard and laughs it off.\nTwilight and Spike agree that doesn't sound like something Applejack would do. Rarity continues that Pinkie tried to lighten the mood with party games.\n Pinkie raises a pi\u00f1ata on the ship and gives Rarity the first turn, but the ship starts to sail into stormy waters. Now wearing a handkerchief like an eye patch, Applejack steers the ship directly into the heart of the storm. Rarity tells Applejack to steer toward calmer waters, leading to an argument over the map that Pinkie soon joins. As the three fight over the map, a giant tidal wave suddenly appears to capsize and sink the ship.\nTwilight is skeptical about Applejack getting sea madness and deliberately causing the ship to sink, believing that Rarity is embellishing on some details. Before Spike can learn how the three even made it back to shore, Rarity suggests they hear Pinkie's side of the story since she can corroborate.\nAt Sugarcube Corner, Pinkie denies Rarity's retelling of the events of the trip, saying she was the one who caused the ship to sink. Like Rarity's story, Pinkie's story \"started on the docks\".\n In a second flashback, Pinkie meets with Applejack and Rarity at the Seaward Shoals docks, having planned a big boat party to help get them out of their element. In Pinkie's retelling, Applejack doesn't talk as much like a salty sea dog as in Rarity's retelling, but Rarity dresses like an extravagant seafarer with over a dozen ponies carrying her luggage. Soon after the three set sail, Pinkie offers a tray of sugary party treats, but Rarity rudely dismisses them as \"simple\" and replaces them with her tray of fancy hors d'oeuvres. She stuffs a cucumber sandwich in Pinkie's mouth, and before Applejack can help herself to the dishes, Rarity tosses them overboard, claiming \"cucumber sandwiches are so ten seconds ago\".\nAs with Rarity's story, Twilight says that Rarity would never act in such a manner. Pinkie continues that she tried to lighten the mood with party games.\n After Pinkie sets up the pi\u00f1ata, she offers Rarity a turn, but Rarity laughs her off. Applejack volunteers to have a turn, but just as the blindfold is put on her, the ship starts to sail into stormy waters. As Applejack and Rarity argue over the map, Pinkie mistakes it for a game of tug-of-war and joins in. At that moment, the giant tidal wave appears. Despite Rarity's claim that \"luxury cruises never sink\", the ship capsizes.\nTwilight finds Pinkie's retelling of the boat trip's events to be just as farfetched as Rarity's, and Pinkie tells her to get Applejack's side of the story. Spike again tries to learn how the three made it back to shore, but before Pinkie can explain, she is interrupted by muffins burning in the oven.\nAt Sweet Apple Acres, Applejack refutes Rarity and Pinkie's accounts of the trip's events by claiming they were both responsible for the ship sinking.\n In a third flashback, Applejack meets with Pinkie and Rarity at the Seaward Shoals docks, having planned a treasure hunt to help get them out of their element. In Applejack's retelling, Rarity dresses and acts even more extravagantly, and Pinkie appears to be dimwitted. After the trio sets sail, Pinkie and Rarity ignore Applejack's efforts to bring them adventure by focusing on their snacks. Before Pinkie can devour Rarity's entire tray of hors d'oeuvres, Applejack trips over a volleyball and accidentally knocks it overboard, earning disdain from both of her shipmates.\nAs with Rarity and Pinkie's stories, Twilight and Spike believe that they would never act like that. Applejack's story continues familiarly with Pinkie's mood-lightening party games.\n After setting up the pi\u00f1ata, Pinkie offers a turn to Rarity, but she brushes her off. Instead, Pinkie gives Applejack a turn by blindfolding her without warning. As the ship sails into stormy waters, Applejack tries to correct the ship's course using the map, but Rarity takes the map to use as a tablecloth. They fight over the map, and Pinkie joins shortly after. Like the previous two stories, it ends with the large tidal wave capsizing and sinking the ship.\nUpon finishing her story, Applejack resolves to never speak to Rarity or Pinkie again until they apologize. Twilight and Spike worry how they are going to get their friends to make amends if they all blame each other for the disastrous trip.\nBack at the Castle of Friendship, Twilight tries to piece together the boat trip's true course of events based on her friends' different accounts and what they had in common. When she thinks she realizes what truly happened, Twilight has an idea to get her friends to reconcile.\n Twilight summons Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie back to Seaward Shoals for a \"friendship emergency\", and they are immediately annoyed to have all been called to the same place. As they argue over who caused the ship to sink, Spike finally demands an answer as to how they made it back to shore. They admit that they hadn't taken the ship very far out to sea, and they simply swam back to the docks. With that answered, Twilight offers to show her friends how she believes the ship really sank.\nOnce the ponies are out to sea, Twilight explains that her friends' stories all shared a common thread: cucumber sandwiches. She tosses the sandwich into the sea and points out another common thread in her friends' stories: the bubbling sea water and the sudden shift in weather. As it turns out, cucumber sandwiches are the favorite food of the tri-horned bunyip, and the tidal wave that sank the ship was caused by the bunyip surfacing from deep water. Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie are skeptical of this claim until the bunyip appears before them and expresses regret for sinking the ponies' ship.\n However, Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie point out the rudeness they showed each other before the ship sank. Twilight explains that each of them was so focused on bringing the other two out of their element that they failed to notice the others doing the same. As a result of this lack of communication, their activity ideas inadvertently clashed. The three ponies are touched by the trouble that their friends went to enjoy themselves on the boat trip and make amends. The ponies and Spike share a group hug and even invite the bunyip to join in.\n In the final scene, the ponies and Spike have a do-over on their boat trip and have fun doing the different activities that Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie originally planned, ending with a round of ice cream. Twilight expresses to Spike that \"there's nothing like a luxurious adventure boat party to get you out of your element\". She replaces Spike's scroll and quill with an ice cream goblet, and Spike agrees with the sentiment."}, {"summary": "The episode opens with Applejack and Big McIntosh giving Filthy Rich his yearly supply of zap apple jam as part of the arrangement between the Apple family and Rich's Barnyard Bargains. Inside the barn, Apple Bloom, eager to take on more responsibility around Sweet Apple Acres, has packed all of the cider to be sold during cider season in crates. However, the cider crates are identical to the zap apple jam crates given to Filthy Rich.\n Applejack asks Apple Bloom if she kept track of what went into each crate, and Apple Bloom nervously assures her that she did. When Applejack discovers zap apple jam in the cider crates, Apple Bloom's little white lie is exposed. After the mix-up with Filthy Rich is straightened out, Applejack asks Apple Bloom why she lied. Apple Bloom explains that she wanted to fix things before anyone found out.\nApplejack says she knows from experience that lies only create trouble. Big McIntosh and Granny Smith support this by claiming Applejack was a compulsive liar when she was a filly and that her lies once landed the Apple family in the hospital.\n In a flashback to Applejack's youth, she and Big McIntosh argue frequently over who would run Sweet Apple Acres more efficiently\u2014Applejack was more idea-oriented while Big Mac, being far more talkative as a teenage colt, valued physical strength. Granny Smith interrupts their arguing and tells them to go into town and buy more blight spray before a recent outbreak of apple blight ruins their entire apple crop for cider season.\nAs Applejack and Big Mac enter Ponyville, they meet Filthy Rich and his fianc\u00e9e, Spoiled Milk. Spoiled is haughty toward the Apple siblings, but Filthy informs her of the close relationship between the Apple family and Rich family dating back to when Ponyville was first founded.\n Having inherited Rich's Barnyard Bargains from his father, Filthy has ideas that he wants to implement to bring the store more business, such as selling the Apple family's cider during cider season. Applejack is intrigued by this idea, but Big Mac says Granny Smith is a tradition-upholding stickler about Sweet Apple Acres being the sole cider seller in Ponyville. Because Filthy appreciates Applejack's ideas more than Big Mac, Applejack agrees to give him three barrels of cider to start out and to give him more if those sell well.\nWhen Applejack and Big McIntosh return to the farm with blight spray, Applejack informs Granny Smith of the deal she made with Filthy Rich, but Granny refuses to allow the Rich family to sell Apple family cider, noting the slower expiration of zap apple jam compared to cider. Having already made her promise to Filthy Rich, Applejack asks Granny to make an exception, but Granny still refuses, especially with the spread of apple blight dwindling the family's crop.\n Applejack and Big Mac go to Filthy Rich's store, with Big Mac expressing \"I-told-you-so's\" along the way. At Filthy's store, Filthy has already set up a display to sell the Apple family's cider. When Applejack tells him that she has to back out of their previous arrangement, Filthy takes offense and chastises her for not keeping her word. He goes so far as to consider cutting all business ties between their two families.\nDesperate to keep relations between the Apples and Riches stable, Applejack claims that Granny Smith is sick and unable to manage the farm as well as she normally does. Filthy Rich takes this into consideration and understands Applejack backing out of their deal.\n Later that evening, as the Apple family sits down for dinner, Big McIntosh has more harsh words for Applejack for making the situation worse by lying. While Granny Smith is busy in the kitchen, Filthy Rich and Spoiled Milk stop by to convey get-well wishes to the supposedly sick Granny. Before they discover the elderly mare is not sick, Applejack distracts Granny by having her go out to the barn and do inventory on the blight sprayers.\nOnce Granny is kept occupied, Applejack compels Filthy and Spoiled to leave, stating that Granny is too sick to see visitors. Unfortunately, she is almost caught in her lies a second time, and she distracts Granny further with old family anecdotes. Applejack goes on to tell Filthy and Spoiled that Granny is suffering from apple blight\u2014an affliction thought to only affect trees\u2014and has been admitted to the Ponyville Hospital.\n Filthy Rich and Spoiled Milk suddenly leave to go visit Granny Smith at the hospital, making the situation even worse. To counter this development, Applejack convinces Granny Smith that she is needed at the hospital because ponies have started to become afflicted with apple blight and the doctors need her expertise on how to cure it. Before Big Mac can say anything in protest, Applejack stuffs an apple in his mouth.At Ponyville Hospital, Applejack brings Granny Smith inside through the back door to avoid being seen by Filthy Rich and Spoiled Milk. She then dresses Granny up in a hospital gown and surgical mask to \"protect\" her from the apple blight outbreak. At the front desk, Applejack meets with Filthy and Spoiled, who are unable to find Granny's hospital room. Applejack gives them a series of convoluted directions to keep them distracted further.\n Returning to Big Mac and Granny Smith, Applejack tries to get Big Mac to pose as Granny in a hospital bed so Filthy and Spoiled can see her quickly and leave. Fed up, Big Mac tells Applejack that the situation is spiraling out of control and goes on a lengthy and emotional rant. Applejack, equally fed up with Big Mac's \"I-told-you-so's\", tells him that she's no longer concerned about realizing her ideas and just wants to preserve the relationship between the Apples and Riches. Reluctantly, Big Mac agrees to go along with Applejack's lie and keep silent.\nBefore Filthy and Spoiled discover the non-sick Granny again, Applejack shoves her into a supply closet. She then takes Filthy and Spoiled to visit Granny in the room where Big Mac is posing as her, but by this time, one of the doctors has wheeled his gurney away. Applejack tells Filthy and Spoiled to follow the gurney while she retrieves Granny from the supply closet. As she searches the hospital for Big McIntosh, she comes across a surgery viewing room, and Granny is mistaken for a doctor about to perform surgery on Big Mac.\n Granny Smith believes she is giving a presentation on apple blight, and she mistakes Big Mac's hooves for rotted tree branches. Before she amputates Big Mac's hooves with a saw, Applejack puts a stop to everything and confesses her lies. She explains that she made promises to Filthy Rich that she couldn't deliver and told lie after lie in order to maintain the Apple family's business ties with him. Big Mac accepts some of the blame for being more of a talker instead of a listener, and he and Applejack reconcile over their earlier arguing.\nHowever, after everything that has happened, Granny Smith is certain she'll be in charge of the farm for a long time, and she warns Filthy Rich not to cut any ties with the Apple family or else she'll inform his grandfather.\n The flashback ends, and Apple Bloom is surprised to learn how much of a liar Applejack was when she was younger. Though Applejack is not proud of the incident, it did instill in her the values of honesty, which Apple Bloom also now appreciates. With everyone in agreement that Granny is the one who really runs Sweet Apple Acres, Granny tells her grandchildren to get back to work...\n"}, {"summary": " At the Wonderbolt Academy, Rainbow Dash finishes her spring training with the Wonderbolts and looks forward to spending her time off with her friends. Spitfire briefly laments being stuck at the academy during her time off training new academy recruits before Rainbow reminds her that she loves yelling and blowing her whistle. On her way home to Ponyville, Rainbow Dash's cutie mark suddenly starts glowing, indicating that she is being summoned by the Cutie Map.\nShe flies to the Castle of Friendship, where Twilight Sparkle tells her that she has been summoned by the map as well. Unfortunately, the map is calling the two to where Rainbow Dash just came from: the Wonderbolt Academy.\n Twilight and Rainbow fly to the academy, where Spitfire instructs a small group of Pegasi for the academy's week of trials. When Twilight and Rainbow appear, the trainees are excited to meet the Princess of Friendship and the most recent full-fledged member of the Wonderbolts before Spitfire commands them to do laps. When Spitfire asks why Rainbow has returned to the academy so soon, she explains that she is on \"official friendship business\". Twilight asks Spitfire if she's noticed any ponies having friendship problems, but Spitfire says she hasn't.\nAs the trainees demonstrate poor form and technique during their laps, Twilight suggests that Rainbow give them advice, but Rainbow states she doesn't want to mess with their confidence. Luckily, the academy's trials week has a classroom portion, and Twilight sees this as an opportunity to both teach the trainees and observe their relationships.\n In the academy classroom, Twilight and Rainbow introduce themselves to the trainees. Among them are two particular trainees: an overconfident stallion named Sky Stinger and his timid wingpony/best friend Vapor Trail. The two have always flown together, but Rainbow points out that part of the trainees' final evaluations is a solo flight trial. Vapor Trail is intimidated by this, but Sky Stinger is certain that he'll pass.\nAfter class, Sky Stinger approaches Twilight and Rainbow and admits, although he is sure of his own flying skills, he worries about Vapor Trail's chances. With the freestyle training portion of the academy trials about to start, Twilight and Rainbow offer to observe their team flying.\n In their observations of Sky and Vapor, Twilight and Rainbow discover that Vapor is using her wings to boost Sky's flight power, meaning he's not as great a flyer as he thinks. At the same time, Vapor is so focused on making Sky look good, she disregards her own flying. As a result, the two are unintentionally holding each other back from succeeding. Twilight realizes this is the friendship problem that they've been summoned to solve. However, while Twilight thinks they should tell Sky and Vapor what they are doing, Rainbow Dash believes telling them could harm their performance in the academy trials.\nIn the academy locker rooms, Twilight and Rainbow speak with Vapor Trail alone and reveal they know she's been supporting Sky Stinger. Vapor Trail feigns ignorance, but they inform her that her secret could negatively affect Sky's evaluation during the solo trials. When asked why she supports Sky the way she does, Vapor explains that Sky grew up with a lot of brothers and sisters and often struggled to get attention from his parents. Meanwhile, Vapor grew up as an only child and received too much attention from her parents.\n When Sky struggled to perform aerial tricks for his parents, Vapor secretly gave him a boost with her wings and offered him praise, and the two became friends. Since then, the two have always flown together, with Vapor boosting Sky's flying, but Sky remained ignorant of Vapor's actions. Twilight and Rainbow explain that Vapor and Sky need to improve their skills as individuals or else they won't be able to get into the academy. Vapor agrees but wants to keep Sky in the dark about what she's been doing so his confidence isn't damaged.\n Rainbow Dash helps Vapor Trail improve her aerobatic tricks, and Twilight personally tutors Sky Stinger in strengthening his wingpower. Unfortunately, only Vapor shows a marked improvement; Sky under-performs at every aspect of Twilight's training. Despite this, Sky remains certain that he'll easily get into the academy and become a Wonderbolt. Unable to keep her secret any longer, Vapor admits to having helped Sky fly the whole time.\nWhen Sky fails to do an aerial trick on his own, he becomes bitter and takes it out on Vapor, accusing her of trying to humiliate him. Sky flies off in anger, wondering why he was ever friends with Vapor in the first place.\n Later, during the Dizzitron trials, Sky Stinger refuses to acknowledge Vapor Trail, much to her heartbreak. Twilight believes this could've been avoided if they had just done things Rainbow Dash's way, but Rainbow realizes that Twilight's solution was better after observing Sky's earlier lack of effort. As a result of Sky and Vapor's falling-out, Sky performs terribly in his trial evaluations. Spitfire is irritated to see one of her most promising trainees suddenly fail, but Rainbow vows to fix things.\n Some time later, Twilight approaches the downtrodden Sky Stinger and explains to him that she was once just as bad at friendship as he is at performing tricks. However, she improved over time with practice and the help of her friends. Meanwhile, Rainbow Dash goes to Vapor Trail and tells her that she would be an amazing flyer if she came out from under Sky Stinger's shadow. Having had no interest in being a Wonderbolt before, Vapor Trail admits that she had fun practicing tricks with Rainbow earlier and decides this is indeed what she wants for herself.\nAt Twilight and Rainbow's encouragement, Sky Stinger and Vapor Trail reconcile their differences and misunderstandings. Sky makes more of an effort to improve his own flying skills, and he gives Vapor advice on her aerobatic feats.\n When the day arrives for the trainees' solo trials, Sky Stinger and Vapor Trail each give impressive performances, much to the amazement of their fellow trainees. As a result, they are accepted into the Wonderbolt Academy with flying colors. Sky Stinger acknowledges that, even though Vapor Trail is a better flyer than him, she can be his wingpony anytime. As they fly off together, Twilight and Rainbow's cutie marks start to glow, meaning their friendship mission is a success.\n With their friendship mission complete, Twilight and Rainbow Dash return home to Ponyville. But before Rainbow can enjoy spending time with her friends, Misty Fly appears on Twilight's castle doorstep and informs Rainbow of a \"Wonderbolt emergency\" at the academy that requires her immediate attention.\n"}, {"summary": " At the Castle of Friendship, Twilight Sparkle, Starlight Glimmer, and Spike carry some old boxes of books into storage. When Twilight thanks the two for their help, Starlight conveys her own thanks to Twilight for all she has taught her about the magic of friendship. As Twilight expresses how proud she is to call Starlight her pupil, Spike looks out the castle window and sees something approaching from the sky. Moments later, mailpony Derpy comes crashing in.\nShe delivers a letter to Starlight Glimmer from her old village. Twilight and Spike believe the town is in danger or upset with Starlight, but Starlight says it is much worse:\n The next day, Starlight travels to her old village, where Double Diamond, Party Favor, Night Glider, Sugar Belle, and the other villagers have decorated for the Sunset Festival. When Starlight greets them, they cruelly turn her away and tear up her festival invitation. As the villagers start to laugh at her, Starlight shuts her eyes. When she reopens them, day has turned to night, and everyone around her has vanished. Just then, Princess Luna appears through the fog and reveals that Starlight is only having a dream.\nRealizing she is more nervous about the festival than she thought, Starlight asks Luna what she should do. Luna tells Starlight that the Mane Six have helped her time and time again and suggests that she share her concerns with them.\n The next morning, the Mane Six and Spike are gathered in the castle throne room, and Starlight confides in them her worries about going to the Sunset Festival, questioning how much they have truly forgiven her and how much she has really changed. The ponies assure Starlight that she has changed for the better and that she would not have been invited to the Sunset Festival if the villagers did not believe the same.\nTwilight suggests that Starlight bring a friend along to help make things easier. Though Twilight subtly hints that Starlight bring her along, Starlight instead chooses to bring along Trixie, much to Trixie's delight and Twilight's disappointment.\n Some time later, Starlight and Trixie arrive on the outskirts of Starlight's old village. Starlight hopes to enjoy the festival without attracting too much attention, and Trixie promises to drag her out of there if she gets too uncomfortable. As they enter the town, the villagers greet Starlight much more positively than they did in her nightmare. However, they quickly overwhelm her with questions about where she is living and how long she will be staying.\nSurrounded by ponies on all sides, the panicked Starlight pushes them away with a magical force field and cowers to the ground in fear. Recognizing her friend's discomfort, Trixie spirits them away from the town with a smoke bomb. As they return to Ponyville, Starlight feels ashamed about how she left, but Trixie tells her that everyone makes mistakes\u2014even Trixie herself.\n Back in Ponyville, Starlight Glimmer meets up with some of her friends, but she notices them acting strangely: Pinkie Pie does not know Starlight's name or where she went, Applejack and Rarity laugh at her misfortune, and Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy whisper to the others in secret. When she goes to speak to Twilight about it at the castle, Spike almost refuses her entry, and when she explains to Twilight what happened at the village, Twilight advises her to \"cut her losses\" and never go back there. Starlight is considerably surprised to hear such advice from the princess of friendship.\nThat night, Starlight Glimmer has another dream about her old village. The villagers she encounters all ignore her, and Twilight appears with her friends to harshly scold Starlight for disobeying her orders. As Starlight senses there is something wrong, the Mane Six vanish into thin air. Princess Luna appears out of the moon, but something appears to hold her back. She informs Starlight Glimmer that the changelings have returned and captured her and Princess Celestia. She tells Starlight to find help but to also be careful of who she trusts. As Luna is detained by the changelings, Starlight is forcibly awakened from her dream.\n Starlight sneaks out of the castle and goes to wake up Trixie in her nearby cart. After determining that Trixie is not a changeling herself, Starlight brings her up to speed on the situation. They sneak back to the castle and find the Mane Six and Spike\u2014changelings in disguise\u2014in the throne room using a magical scarab beetle array to communicate with Queen Chrysalis. The changeling drones report to their queen they have taken the Mane Six's places and seized control of the castle. Chrysalis reports that Celestia and Luna have also been replaced in Canterlot.\nHaving thought too small the last time she attempted to take over Equestria, Chrysalis has organized a systematic capture of all of the most important ponies in the land, leaving no one left to stop the changelings from taking over. When their communication ends, Starlight nearly gives herself and Trixie away with a creak in the throne room doorway, but they avoid being discovered with Starlight's invisibility spell.\n Starlight teleports herself and Trixie back to Trixie's wagon, and Trixie feels unqualified to deal with such a situation as a changeling invasion. With Twilight, Celestia, and Luna captured, Starlight suggests seeking the help of Princess Cadance and Shining Armor in the Crystal Empire, but Thorax appears to inform them that Cadance, Shining Armor, and Flurry Heart have all been taken prisoner as well.\nTrixie and Thorax look to Starlight Glimmer for guidance, but Starlight is unsure of what to do. As they are certain there is no one around with powerful magic to help them, Discord appears.\n After determining that Discord isn't a changeling, Starlight informs him that the Mane Six and all of the royals of Equestria have been taken prisoner. Discord is furious to learn that Fluttershy has been taken, and he transports the four of them to the outskirts of the Changeling Kingdom, where Queen Chrysalis' castle lies."}, {"summary": " On the outskirts of the Changeling Kingdom, Discord is confused as to why he and his allies didn't instantly teleport to Fluttershy's location. Before Thorax can explain or Starlight Glimmer can make a plan, Discord attempts to storm the changeling castle on the back of a flying pig, but as soon as he breaches the changelings' perimeter, his magic fades away. Thorax explains that Queen Chrysalis' throne is carved from ancient dark stone that soaks up all non-changeling magic, rendering Starlight, Trixie, and Discord virtually powerless.\nAs before, Starlight's friends look to her for guidance, despite her discomfort being in a leadership role. Hesitantly, she makes a plan for them to infiltrate the hive, destroy the throne, and regain their magic. On their way to the hive, Discord and Trixie squabble. Starlight suggests they come up with a way to identify each other in case they get separated, like a secret code. After Discord trips over a rock, Trixie comes up with the code phrase \"klutzy draconequus\", much to Discord's chagrin.\n Inside the hive, Starlight, Discord, and Trixie find the inner layout to have a constantly shifting geography; chamber doorways are always opening and closing in random locations, and only changelings are able to navigate it. As Starlight and her friends traverse the inner workings of the hive, Starlight is unsure how they will even destroy the throne when they find it while Discord and Trixie continue to argue.\nStarlight is barely able to keep it together being thrust into her role as leader, and the situation is made worse when they become lost in the hive in spite of Thorax's navigation. As Trixie gives up hope, she asks Thorax about changelings' feeding habits, and Thorax explains that he hasn't been hungry since meeting Spike, despite the fact that changelings are always hungry. He also explains that, since becoming friends with the Crystal Ponies, he has disregarded his usual feeding habits, and his wings became embedded with crystal.\n When Discord loudly announces his intention to save Fluttershy, he attracts the attention of a changeling patrol. Starlight Glimmer comes up with the idea of Thorax disguising himself as Trixie and evading the changelings with smoke bombs. After giving them the slip, Starlight expands her plan further by following some of the changelings to Chrysalis' throne room.\nStarlight and her friends follow the changelings to Chrysalis' inner sanctum, but with the hive now on high alert, the entrance is heavily guarded. Trixie is out of smoke bombs, so Discord distracts the changeling guards with stand-up comedy. The changelings chase after him, allowing Starlight, Trixie, and Thorax to enter the inner sanctum.\n Discord eventually eludes the changelings in a cocoon nursery, and he reunites with Fluttershy, sobbing with her tail caught under a rock. Fluttershy is overjoyed to see Discord, but Discord immediately recognizes this to be a trap. As Fluttershy continues to cry, numerous crying Fluttershy duplicates appear, and Discord is left wondering if one of them is the real Fluttershy.\nStarlight, Trixie, and Thorax wait for Discord to return, but Trixie believes he might have been captured, and Thorax suggests they move on toward the throne room. Just then, Discord appears to regroup with his friends and says he learned from the changelings where the throne room is. However, he doesn't recognize their \"klutzy draconequus\" code phrase, and the others immediately realize he's a changeling.\n As \"Discord\" leads his friends down the left path at a fork in the road, Thorax warns that he's leading them into an ambush. Trixie volunteers to distract the changeling while Starlight and Thorax find the throne, but Starlight is unsure of moving on without her best friend. Trixie assures Starlight that, even without magic, she has been an excellent leader thus far. After Trixie distracts \"Discord\" with a magic trick that binds their wrists together, Starlight and Thorax escape, leaving Trixie to be captured by the waiting swarm.\nAs Starlight and Thorax continue running from the changelings, they split up in order to avoid capture. Eventually, Starlight finds her way into Chrysalis' throne room and discovers the throne \u2013 as well as all of her friends trapped in cocoons on the ceiling. Unfortunately, Chrysalis had been waiting for Starlight to arrive, and the changelings come out of hiding to restrain her.\n Chrysalis brags that she thought so little of Starlight that she didn't bother replacing her with one of her changeling drones. With all of the most important and powerful ponies in Equestria captured, Chrysalis is certain of her victory. However, Starlight reminds her of Thorax, and Chrysalis angrily tells her not to mention the \"traitor\". As Chrysalis threatens to teach Thorax a lesson for betraying the hive, Starlight's eyes glimmer with a blue light, and Chrysalis realizes that Thorax has been in front of her the whole time.\nMeanwhile, Starlight herself attempts to break the throne, but she is caught in the act and forced to take shelter from Chrysalis' attacks inside the hollow throne. Despite this development, Chrysalis remarks that everything has gone according to her plan to harvest all the love in Equestria and feed her hive for generations.\n Remembering Thorax's crystallized wings and satisfied hunger, Starlight proposes to Chrysalis that she and her changelings don't have to take others' love by force. Chrysalis dismisses this notion, stating that changeling hunger can never be satisfied. Starlight explains that ever since Thorax made friends and started sharing love, he hasn't needed to feed as often as changelings usually do.\nStarlight's words start to reach the changeling drones, but Chrysalis is still dismissive of the claims of a \"mewling grub\". Despite her powerlessness, Starlight confronts Chrysalis directly, understanding what it's like to lead through fear and intimidation.\n Ignoring Starlight's words, Chrysalis starts to drain the love that Thorax gained from the Crystal Ponies. Thorax is unable to hold onto the love inside him, so Starlight tells him to share it with Chrysalis willingly. This creates a tremendous burst of light that blows Chrysalis away and transforms Thorax into a new form of changeling: he is now taller with a green coat, orange pincers, and luminescent wings, and the holes in his hooves have been healed.\nThe other changelings follow Thorax's example of sharing love and take on similar, colorful forms. The resulting magical energy causes Chrysalis' throne to explode, and the ponies that the changelings captured are all freed. As Princess Luna commends Starlight on her accomplishment, Chrysalis emerges from the rubble. Starlight Glimmer stands before her again, telling her that she can be a leader her subjects deserve, and offers her hoof in friendship. However, Chrysalis rejects Starlight's offering and swears absolute revenge upon her before flying away.\nWith Chrysalis' abandonment of her kingdom, Thorax is declared the changelings' new ruler, and Princess Celestia looks forward to improving relationship between ponies and changelings. Discord proposes a tea celebration at Fluttershy's Cottage, but Starlight Glimmer has a better idea.\n Starlight returns to her old village, and Double Diamond and Party Favor are surprised to see her again after the way she left just recently. Starlight expresses how much she has changed since she first founded the village and how comfortable she is being a more positive and listening leader. With that in mind, she offers to help oversee the remainder of the Sunset Festival and asks to allow her other friends to join, to which the villagers happily agree.\nAs the ponies join in the festival, Discord and Trixie reconcile after their earlier arguing, and Discord even offers to incorporate some of his chaos powers into her magic act.\nTaking Trixie at her literal word, Discord conjures up a pair of untamed flying pigs, and he and Trixie go flying down the street, much to the confusion of the Mane Six and Spike.\n"}]}, {"season": "7", "eps": [{"summary": " The episode begins with Spike speaking with Starlight Glimmer at her Castle of Friendship bedroom door.

For their accomplishment, the four of them are each awarded with the \"Pink Heart of Courage\". During the reception party, while Starlight and Trixie mingle with their friends, Discord asks Twilight what her plans are for her student. Twilight says she has three more years of friendship lessons planned out, but Discord laughs it off, saying Starlight has progressed beyond needing friendship lessons.\nDue to Discord's persistent needling on the subject, Twilight gets very nervous about her plans for Starlight, to the point of retreating to her library. Realizing that Starlight has mastered nearly every lesson that Twilight mapped out for her, Twilight turns to her own mentor Princess Celestia for advice. In the throne room, Twilight explains her dilemma to Celestia and comes to realize that, just as Celestia had sent Twilight away to Ponyville to learn about friendship, she must now send Starlight away. Celestia sympathizes with Twilight and tells her no matter how difficult or painful her decision, she must decide for herself what's right.\n As Discord informs the rest of the Mane Six about Twilight's upcoming decision, Twilight tries to decide where to send Starlight to further her friendship studies through a series of magical simulations. In the first simulation, she considers sending Starlight to the Changeling Kingdom to help them adjust to their new way of life. Celestia approves of the idea, but Twilight becomes nervous about the possibility of one of the changelings making Starlight look bad and instigating a rebellion against her.\nIn the second simulation, Twilight considers sending Starlight to the Dragon Lands to spend time with Ember and the dragons. However, she worries that the more rambunctious dragons' activities will be too much for Starlight to handle. In the third simulation, she considers sending Starlight to the Crystal Empire to continue her magic studies with Sunburst. But she worries if they get ambitious enough to try more complicated spells, Starlight could potentially gets sucked into a black hole.\n After watching all of Twilight's simulations and listening to all of her worries, Celestia starts to laugh. She reveals that, when they were teacher and student, Celestia had the same fears about Twilight that Twilight now has about Starlight. When Twilight was a filly, she demonstrated great academic aptitude but always kept herself isolated from other ponies. Eventually, Celestia decided the best thing was to send Twilight to Ponyville, but she kept coming up with excuses to not send her away. She realized it was because she didn't want Twilight to go and that once she made friends, she wouldn't need her teacher anymore. Twilight conveys to Celestia that she will always need her, and Celestia assures her that Starlight feels the same way.\nTwilight returns to the party in the castle dining hall, and the ponies eagerly await her announcement. Twilight officially recognizes Starlight's completed lessons and many accomplishments and says she has nothing left to teach her. With this, she announces that today is her pupil's graduation day, and the ponies cheer for Starlight Glimmer.\n Before Starlight makes plans with her friends to celebrate her graduation, she pulls Twilight aside to discuss what this means in more detail. While Twilight is very proud of her student and assures her that she's ready, Starlight reveals that she isn't ready to leave yet. This comes as a great relief to Twilight, and she presents her with her graduation gift: a decorative wall mirror with photographs of her friends.

As Starlight becomes more frustrated, a magical cloud of red smoke begins to emanate from her horn, but it dissipates when she calms down.\n At the Ponyville train station, Starlight, Trixie, and Spike see Twilight and her friends off as they leave for Manehattan. Starlight assures Twilight that they'll take care of the castle while she's gone, with Trixie jokingly remarking if anything goes wrong, Starlight can go back in time and fix it.\nLater, Starlight offers to teach Trixie some more magic, and Trixie says she wants to learn teleportation. Starlight explains that her own magic is tied to her emotions\u2014the stronger she feels, the stronger her magic. When Trixie brings up Starlight's dubious past, Starlight's anger causes more red smoke to manifest from her horn. Despite this, she agrees to teach Trixie about teleporting, using an apple placed on the Cutie Map as a target. Unfortunately, when Trixie casts the spell, it teleports the map away instead of the apple.\n Starlight panics over the map's disappearance, and Trixie's overall lack of concern over the situation only causes her more frustration, generating more red smoke. When Starlight finally notices the smoke cloud over her head, she uses a spell to contain her anger inside a glass bottle before it causes her to drive Trixie away.

At every turn, Trixie makes Starlight more and more frustrated, causing her to bottle more and more of her anger. The more anger Starlight bottles up, the weaker she inadvertently becomes. Once Trixie realizes what Starlight is doing, she tries to seize the bottle, and she causes Starlight to accidentally toss the bottle away at the precise moment that the jeweler pony and Granny Smith are buying cinnamon nuts from Bulk Biceps. The bottle shatters on the ground near them, and they are possessed by Starlight's anger.\nBack in Manehattan, the Mane Six's great teamwork leads them to finding the key to the escape room's door.

They chase Trixie across town, and because of all the anger Starlight bottled up, she is too weak to help. Trixie is subject to more of the ponies' anger, but she doesn't know why they're mad at her. Starlight eventually drains the anger out of them and explains to Trixie that their anger actually came from her. She finally vents all of her pent-up frustrations about Trixie's behavior throughout the day. Once Trixie apologizes for how she acted, Starlight's anger subsides, and she realizes the negative repercussions of bottling up her emotions.\nAs Starlight and Trixie reconcile, Trixie finally remembers the last thing she was thinking of before teleporting the Cutie Map. She had sent it to the Ponyville Day Spa because she was thinking how glad she was to have befriended Starlight, and the Day Spa was where they first met.\n Starlight and Trixie return the Cutie Map to the castle throne room just as the Mane Six return from their friendship retreat.

There, she reads a story to the sick foals about a heroic pony named Gusty the Great and a villain named Grogar.

After giving her very short \"vale-rock-torian\" speech, Maud receives her diploma from Professor Rusty Tenure, much to her parents' delight and Pinkie's utter excitement.\n On the Friendship Express train, Pinkie Pie is thrilled to learn that Maud is considering moving to Ponyville now that she has graduated, already planning out the fun they will have together. Specifically, Maud is trying to decide between Ponyville and Ghastly Gorge, saying that it has to be a \"rock-based decision\". Thus, Pinkie is determined to show Maud that Ponyville has better rocks to study than Ghastly Gorge does.\nOn their first stop, Pinkie and Maud meet Rarity and Spike as they mine for gemstones in a crystal cave. Rarity explains that she's trying to find rare chartreuse gems for Coloratura's album release party. However, Maud effortlessly finds a vein of chartreuse, remarking that it and all the gems in the cave are fairly common.\n Next, Pinkie takes Maud to the impressive Castle of Friendship. However, Maud is still unimpressed, saying that a lot of structures are built from rocks. Pinkie starts to get desperate for Maud to choose Ponyville over Ghastly Gorge until Maud admits that her decision is not entirely \"rock-based\". Having always studied rocks by herself, Maud also wants a friend to talk to besides her sister and pet Boulder.\n At that moment, Starlight Glimmer comes running out of the castle and bumps into Maud. Much to Pinkie's surprise, Starlight and Maud had met once before; while traveling Equestria for her rocktorate dissertation, Maud encountered Starlight back when she first founded her village. As Starlight leaves to run some errands, Pinkie encourages Maud to accompany and befriend her.\nAs Maud helps with Starlight's errands, the two find a little common ground about liking kites. However, Pinkie Pie serves as a constant, intrusive presence, trying to make them close friends as quickly as possible. As Starlight and Maud explore the crystal cave again and bond over rocks, they discover a secret waterfall grotto hidden behind a hollow wall of granite, piquing Maud's interest. Unfortunately, Pinkie continues to be a third wheel, using methods to push Starlight and Maud closer such as intentionally causing a cave-in. Maud makes a way out using Boulder, but Pinkie's constant meddling starts to annoy her.\n That night, at Sugarcube Corner, Pinkie comes up with even more ways to make Maud and Starlight closer friends. Maud tries to talk to Pinkie about her pushiness, but Pinkie is so excited for her sister to move to Ponyville that she doesn't listen. The next morning, Maud has left, and Pinkie discovers her note saying she decided to move to Ghastly Gorge. Pinkie informs Starlight Glimmer about Maud's departure and laments that the two couldn't become friends. Starlight tells Pinkie that she liked Maud, but her efforts to push them together did more harm than good. Meanwhile, Maud mines for rocks in Ghastly Gorge and discovers a piece of emerald jasper, unaware of the monstrous quarray eels that lurk nearby.\nWhen Pinkie catches up with Maud, she saves her from being eaten by a quarray eel, and they escape the eel-infested canyon together. Pinkie apologizes to Maud for trying to force her and Starlight together and for underestimating her ability to make friends on her own. She begs Maud to give Ponyville another chance and promises to give her space, and Maud accepts.\n Back in Ponyville, Starlight and Maud fly kites together, and Maud tells Starlight she has decided to move to Ponyville, having moved into the waterfall grotto they discovered in the crystal cave near town.

While running an obstacle course built out of books and household items, Angel trips and injures his leg. Fluttershy, fresh out of bunny leg braces, takes him to the clinic of veterinarian Dr. Fauna.\nUnfortunately, Dr. Fauna's clinic is packed with injured or sick animals, and the doctor is overwhelmed because most of the animals refuse to leave even after they have recovered. Fluttershy feels guilty about this due to her recommending Dr. Fauna to all of her animal friends and comes up with a solution to satisfy both the doctor and her many patients.\n Fluttershy gathers the rest of the Mane Six to her cottage to explain the situation, and the ponies eagerly agree to help. With their assistance, Fluttershy sees this as an opportunity to realize a lifelong dream of hers: building an animal sanctuary that caters to critters of all species and sizes. Fluttershy's friends are so inspired by her confidence and passion for her dream project that they enlist the help of a few expert ponies to make it a reality:\nApplejack recommends Fluttershy to Wrangler, an expert in herding and animal enclosures. Pinkie Pie recommends Hard Hat, Ponyville's foremost construction worker. Finally, Rarity recommends Canterlot interior decorator Dandy Grandeur, who helped her establish Canterlot Carousel.\n Some time later, Wrangler, Hard Hat, and Dandy Grandeur assemble at Fluttershy's cottage to discuss her sanctuary project. When she shares with them her vision of what she wants the sanctuary to look like, however, they appear uncertain. Nonetheless, they agree to help Fluttershy on behalf of her friends who recommended them to her.\n First, Fluttershy takes Hard Hat to an open field and explains the layout of her sanctuary. Hard Hat, picturing the sanctuary to look more like a hospital building, suggests clearing away some trees to make room, but Fluttershy insists on incorporating the trees into the sanctuary. Next, Dandy Grandeur suggests lavish designs for the sanctuary's curtains, but Fluttershy says there's no need, insisting on a natural color scheme of greens and browns.\nLastly, Wrangler offers a variety of cages to keep the animals in, but Fluttershy is firmly against the use of cages in her sanctuary. Later, when Fluttershy checks on the expert ponies' progress, she discovers that they have gone against her wishes and started building the animal sanctuary according to their own respective expertise. As a result, the front door is too small for larger animals to fit through, Dandy's curtains block out the sunlight, and Wrangler's cages are too confining.\n Because the expert ponies did not do as she asked, Fluttershy dismisses them from the project. When Dr. Fauna brings the animals by to see the sanctuary, Fluttershy's fears are confirmed when the animals disagree with the inhospitable amenities, and the incomplete building comes crashing down.\nThat evening, Fluttershy and Dr. Fauna find themselves in the same situation as when they started: with an overcrowded animal clinic. Dr. Fauna thanks Fluttershy for trying her best, but Fluttershy refuses to give up on her dream. The next day, she assembles her friends at her cottage again and decides to take charge of the sanctuary project herself. To help her realize her dream, Fluttershy has enlisted the help of someone she knows she can trust to abide by her wishes: Big Daddy McColt of the McColt family.\n With Fluttershy and Big Daddy McColt overseeing the project, the ponies and their friends succeed in building the animal sanctuary in accordance with Fluttershy's intended vision. Fluttershy shows Dr. Fauna to the completed sanctuary, dubbed the Sweet Feather Sanctuary, and it is met by the doctor and animals' unanimous approval.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins in Canterlot, where Sassy Saddles frantically tries to get Canterlot Carousel ready for the transition from winter to spring fashions.

Before the Cutie Mark Crusaders can consider alternative means of travel, the slingshot rockets Scootaloo into the sky.\nUpon arriving in Cloudsdale, Scootaloo ends up at the home of Rainbow Dash's parents, Bow Hothoof and Windy Whistles, much to her extreme excitement. After her initial starstruck awe, Scootaloo explains to Bow and Windy that she's doing a school report about their daughter and putting together a scrapbook dedicated to her. Bow and Windy, the incredibly proud parents they are, give Scootaloo a tour of their house and show her Rainbow's bedroom and vast collection of medals and trophies.\n When Scootaloo asks where Rainbow's \"Wonderbolt stuff\" is, Bow and Windy think she's referring to her collection of Wonderbolts memorabilia. However, Scootaloo actually refers to mementos from her time as a Wonderbolt Academy cadet and eventually a full-fledged Wonderbolt, drawing much confusion from the two parents.\nAt the Wonderbolt Academy, Rainbow Dash practices a flying routine with the Wonderbolts when Bow Hothoof and Windy Whistles' loud cheering suddenly disrupts them. After Scootaloo informed them that their daughter is a Wonderbolt, the already proud parents are even prouder. They smother Rainbow with pride and affection and introduce themselves to Spitfire and the other Wonderbolts. Rainbow chews Scootaloo out about telling her parents that she's a Wonderbolt without her permission, saying that while she loves her parents dearly, they can be very embarrassing.\nDuring the next Wonderbolts show, Scootaloo recounts to Bow and Windy their daughter's journey to becoming a Wonderbolt, from her acceptance into the academy to becoming a Reserves member to her encounter with deceitful veteran Wind Rider and her eventual induction as a full member. As the Wonderbolts perform, Bow and Windy get considerably carried away in showing their daughter support, cheering boisterously and setting off fireworks. Their overzealous support of Rainbow Dash even carries over into Wonderbolt autograph signings, ribbon-cutting ceremonies, and photo-ops.\n When Rainbow's parents go as far as cheering for her in the Wonderbolts locker room, she finally snaps and angrily says their support is too much for her to bear. She tells them their over-passionate cheering is why she didn't tell them she was a Wonderbolt in the first place, and she asks them to leave.

Scootaloo, shocked by Rainbow's cruel dismissal of her supportive parents, decides to write her school report about someone else.\n Rainbow Dash catches up with Scootaloo to offer an explanation for why she snapped at her parents. She reveals that, when she was a little filly, she wasn't always a fast flyer, and the only thing she could win in competitive races was participation awards. However, her parents cheered for her just as loudly and embarrassingly as in the present day, despite her never winning any races. Over time, she started to win races and place higher in competitions, but her parents' overzealous support alienated the other foals.\nScootaloo expresses some jealousy that Rainbow Dash has parents as supportive as they are.

Sugar Belle expresses to Big Mac how excited she is to bake apple-flavored treats but needing more shelf space in her bakery to display them. When the Crusaders see how Big Mac acts toward Sugar Belle, they realize he has a crush on her. Big Mac is nervous about telling Sugar Belle how he feels, but the Crusaders are sure she feels the same way about him because she orders so many apples just to see him. With the Crusaders' encouragement, Big Mac approaches Sugar Belle with a flower. However, before he can say anything, he gets pushed out of the way by a smooth-tongued stallion named Feather Bangs who also has affection for Sugar Belle.\nRealizing he can't compete with Feather Bangs' confidence and smooth talk, Big Mac walks away dejected, but the Crusaders offer to help him win Sugar Belle's heart. Big Mac accepts\u2014as long as the fillies agree not to use any love potions.\n Sweetie Belle applies her knowledge of fairytale romance stories to help Big McIntosh win Sugar Belle's affections.

In Sugar Belle's bakery, Big Mac sings her a heartfelt country ballad that seems to move her. However, Feather Bangs interrupts yet again with a heavily-autotuned pop song and backup dancers. As Big Mac and Feather Bangs' singing escalates into a musical duel, Sugar Belle gets more and more annoyed. Their efforts eventually result in Sugar Belle's bakery being destroyed, and she angrily tells both of them to leave her alone.\nDiscouraged by his failure to impress Sugar Belle, Big McIntosh falls into despair. When Sweetie Belle wonders why her fairytale-inspired plans didn't work, Big Mac explains Sugar Belle isn't a fairytale princess\u2014she's a real, kind, and hardworking pony. Apple Bloom suggests abandoning the fairytale plans and doing something that would mean a lot to Sugar Belle personally, and Big Mac gets an idea.\n As Scootaloo keeps Sugar Belle distracted in town, Big Mac and Apple Bloom assemble something in her bakery. When Scootaloo is unable to distract Sugar Belle any longer, she returns to her bakery and discovers that Big Mac has built her a new display case to exhibit her baked goods. Sugar Belle immediately starts dreaming about the new desserts she can make, and she thanks Big Mac for his efforts, revealing that she indeed likes him in return.

To serve as the contest's judges, Rarity has enlisted Hoity Toity, Photo Finish, and a surprise guest:Applejack overhears this while walking past, and she is confused as to why Rarity would select her to be a judge in a fashion contest. Rarity explains that, while Hoity Toity is an expert at fashion and Photo Finish has an artistic eye, neither of them share Applejack's practicality and honesty. Applejack is still unsure about being a judge, however, so she agrees to think it over. While she returns to Sweet Apple Acres, Rarity and Spike continue putting up flyers.\n At Sweet Apple Acres, Applejack confides in Apple Bloom and Big McIntosh about her uncertainties in being a fashion judge, but she demonstrates her practicality during apple-bucking by helping Apple Bloom with a new look she's trying out. Realizing the fashion community could benefit from her sensible outlook, Applejack returns to Rarity and agrees to be a contest judge. Just then, Photo Finish and Hoity Toity arrive, and Applejack demonstrates her ability as an honest and practical judge for them by bluntly criticizing photos from Miss Pommel's recent fashion debut.\n In the boutique sewing room, Rarity, Hoity Toity, Photo Finish, and Applejack meet the three ponies taking part in Rarity's contest: a flighty unicorn mare with a Valley girl accent named Lily Lace, an Earth pony stallion with a taste for avant-garde named Starstreak, and a goth Pegasus mare named Inky Rose. For the contest, Lily Lace intends to present designs inspired by bird songs, Starstreak looks to more cutting-edge and \"futuristic\" designs, and Inky Rose's designs incorporate mostly black and dark colors.\nHoity Toity and Photo Finish approve of the designers' inspirations, but Applejack's reactions are mainly those of criticism, questioning the functionality of the designers' clothes. Both the designers and the other judges are put off by Applejack's words, but Rarity assures Applejack that her practicality is exactly what the contest needs. However, Applejack's blunt critiquing wears on the contestants' patience as the day goes on.\nBefore she upsets the designers and other judges too much, Rarity cuts the day short for the contestants to get ready for the public showing of their designs the next day. While Applejack is pleased by the day's progress, Rarity worries that Applejack's candid opinions about fashion will jeopardize the contest results.\n The next day, Rarity and the contest judges oversee the final adjustments of the contestants' designs before their evening debut. Like the day before, Photo Finish and Hoity Toity are mostly receptive to the contestants' work, but Applejack once again favors function over fashion, criticizing their designs until they meet her satisfaction.\nWhen Photo Finish and Hoity Toity get into an argument over which belt to accessorize Starstreak's designs with (despite both belts appearing to be completely identical), Applejack vents her frustration and admits she finds all fashion ridiculous. Feeling insulted, Photo Finish, Hoity Toity, and the contest designers leave, and Rarity follows them in tears.\n With her contest now ruined, Rarity tells the construction ponies assembling the runway to stop building, placing blame for this fiasco on Applejack. When Applejack argues she was just being honest like Rarity wanted, Rarity sets out to prove that some honesty can be hurtful. She takes Applejack to the home of Strawberry Sunrise, who bluntly reveals that she hates apples. This greatly offends Applejack, but Rarity points out that it's just Strawberry's \"honest opinion\". Applejack realizes that Strawberry's harsh opinions about apples mirror her own opinions about the contest designers' hard work, and she resolves to fix the mess she made.\n Before Photo Finish, Hoity Toity, and the contest designers leave Ponyville, Applejack brings them back to Carousel Boutique\u2014mainly by tying them up and hijacking their modes of transportation\u2014and apologizes to them for being unintentionally hurtful with her honesty. She also admits that, while she still doesn't fully understand fashion, she can appreciate the passion and hard work they put into it. Applejack asks them to finish the contest, and the designers and judges agree.\n Applejack helps the construction ponies rebuild the contest runway and assists the contest designers finish their designs. When Rarity returns to the boutique\u2014after Pinkie Pie kept her distracted for an hour\u2014Applejack apologizes for nearly ruining the contest, and Rarity thanks her for her efforts.

Twilight warns Starlight, however, that the last time the sisters fought, Luna turned into Nightmare Moon and Celestia had to banish her for a thousand years.\nThe following morning, Starlight and Celestia share a pancake breakfast again, and like the previous morning, Luna quickly enters only for food and attempts to leave. This time, Starlight confronts the two sisters about their respective lack of appreciation for the other's efforts. Celestia and Luna try to talk about their problem, but it quickly turns into an argument over whose royal duties are more difficult.\n In an effort to stop their arguing, Starlight Glimmer uses her magic to switch their cutie marks for twenty-four hours. The princesses are angered at first, but Starlight sees this as an opportunity for them to trade places and learn to appreciate the burden of each other's daily duties. Begrudgingly, Celestia and Luna agree. When Starlight informs Twilight of this development, she hyperventilates. Later that day, Luna sees to Celestia's checklist of royal duties, many of which involve public appearances and smiling uncomfortably to her subjects. During a photo-op at a School for Gifted Unicorns fundraiser, the photographer takes Luna's picture right when her cheeks are so sore that she stops smiling. This causes her to get discredited in the newspaper and the fundraiser to fail.

After addressing a three-hour-long dispute between the mayors of Fillydelphia and Baltimare, an exhausted Luna turns in for the day.\n That night, after everyone in Equestria has gone to sleep, Celestia sees to Luna's royal duties; the solitude of being the only pony awake causes her to start talking to herself. With Luna's magic, Celestia travels to the dreamscape to observe ponies' dreams and relieve them of their nightmares. She finds Starlight Glimmer having a nightmare, doubting her own decision to switch Celestia and Luna's cutie marks and causing them to drift even further apart. She fears her inability to solve their friendship problem will cause Nightmare Moon to return, and Nightmare Moon herself suddenly appears.\nAs Princess Celestia protects Starlight Glimmer from Nightmare Moon, an evil and fiery alter ego of Celestia also appears: Daybreaker.\n Daybreaker tries to make Celestia doubt her relationship with Luna, and she fights against Nightmare Moon. With Celestia and Starlight caught in the middle, Starlight fears she has doomed Equestria. Using the power of the dream world, Celestia observes Luna's nightmare, in which she fears causing further sadness to the school foals. Celestia appears to pull Luna out of her nightmare and into Starlight's, where Luna witnesses the struggle between Nightmare Moon and Daybreaker.\nAs Starlight continues to despair, Luna tells Celestia that it is up to her alone to stop the nightmare. Celestia doubts herself, admitting that Luna's responsibility and burden are much harder than her own. Luna admits the same about Celestia's responsibilities and provides her support. With her sister's faith and trust, Celestia intervenes in Nightmare Moon and Daybreaker's conflict, eventually succeeding in dispelling the nightmare visions.\n The next morning, Luna offers her own pancake breakfast to Celestia\u2014albeit poorly made\u2014and the two sisters reconcile over their previous disagreements with a better appreciation of each other's duties. As Starlight Glimmer joins them, they commend her for having the boldness to do what she did. The effects of the cutie mark switching spell wear off, returning Celestia and Luna's cutie marks to normal, and Starlight's own cutie mark starts to glow, signifying a successful Cutie Map mission.\nSuddenly, a hyperactive Twilight appears to congratulate Starlight and asks for a detailed summary of events.

Prince Rutherford assures Pinkie that this happens during every Yickslurbertfest and that the tenacious yaks will have the snow removed shortly.

Her story involves a situation very similar to that of Yakyakistan's\u2014substituting the yaks for goats, the snow for desert sand, and the ponies for cows\u2014and tells of how the goats reached out to the cows for help in their time of need. Unfortunately, Rutherford fails to absorb the lesson of Pinkie's story.\n Pinkie then tries using reverse psychology to get Rutherford to invite the rest of her friends to enjoy the snow-covered Yakyakistan. However, Rutherford responds with a questionable tale about his childhood and reaffirms that yaks don't ask for help from others. When Pinkie starts to get desperate, Rutherford decides that she doesn't truly understand yak culture, and he revokes her honorary yak title. Frustrated by the prince's stubbornness, Pinkie Pie leaves Yakyakistan.\n As Pinkie Pie returns to Ponyville, Prince Rutherford and the yaks consign themselves to their new snow-filled lifestyle\u2014despite growing unrest among the yaks toward their prince's leadership. Meanwhile, at the Castle of Friendship in Ponyville, Pinkie Pie explains the yaks' situation to her friends and decides to help Yakyakistan anyway. Applejack offers to bring the yaks apples to eat and Rarity offers fabrics to keep them warm, but Pinkie insists that, because the yaks are too proud to ask for help, the ponies must help them covertly.\nThe Mane Six return to Yakyakistan after dark and sneak into the village. As the yaks sleep, the ponies remove most of the snow, clear the storm clouds, restore their crops and hay beds, and bake fresh Yakyakistan cakes. When the yaks wake up the next morning, they are surprised to find their village back to normal. The yaks' faith in Rutherford is restored, but Rutherford notices the ponies just as they are leaving.\n When Rutherford confronts Pinkie Pie outside the village gates, she fears his angry retribution, but he is instead grateful that Pinkie had the sensitivity to help his village without making them ask. Because she truly does understand yak culture, Rutherford declares her an honorary yak again and gives her a set of fake yak horns."}, {"summary": " The episode begins at Fluttershy's cottage during Fluttershy and Discord's weekly tea party, with Discord supplying his usual signature brand of chaos to the mix. When Fluttershy mentions having to restock on sugarcubes, Discord realizes how much effort she puts into organizing their weekly get-togethers. Feeling like he has taken advantage of Fluttershy's hospitality enough, Discord offers to throw their next tea party in his home realm of Chaosville the very next day.\nFluttershy is not only looking forward to Discord's tea party but also to visiting his home for the first time, and Discord, realizing he has never hosted a party before, leaves to make appropriate preparations. In Ponyville, he has a conversation with a duplicate of himself about how to put together the best tea party that Fluttershy has ever had.\n Discord goes to Fluttershy's usual tea shop and, upon seeing the boring teas that the shopkeeper is selling, buys some bags of ginseng and uses his magic to make them sing. At a china shop, he buys a tea set for two and uses his magic to make the teapot sprout wings. Finally, at a party store, he buys a sneezing pi\u00f1ata and glowing, flying napkins. During his party shopping, Discord runs into Pinkie Pie and asks for her advice on how to make the ideal tea party for Fluttershy. Pinkie tells him to simply make Fluttershy feel comfortable.\nUpon returning to his home in Chaosville, Discord realizes that the chaos around his house would make Fluttershy uncomfortable. With the help of several duplicates of himself, Discord sets out to create an environment that Fluttershy would like. First, he gets rid of all the new party supplies that he bought in Ponyville. Next, he gets rid of the various chaotic elements already in his house, such as chairs that hang from the ceiling and staircases that don't lead anywhere.\n After placing more normal-looking household decor, Discord finally gives himself a new, normal look. With his own duplicates, Discord also practices more conventional party conversation.\n When the time for their scheduled tea party arrives, Discord transports Fluttershy to his realm, and Fluttershy is excited to finally see where he lives. However, she is surprised by how normal Discord and everything around him looks. Without the usual chaos that Fluttershy has come to expect from Discord, she appears considerably disappointed. She asks Discord about the drastic changes he has made to himself, but Discord assures her that he feels perfectly normal.\nWhen Discord picks up the tea kettle, however, it suddenly phases through his hand and falls on the floor. Much to Fluttershy's shock, he is starting to fade out of existence. Each time Discord exhibits \"normal\" behavior, he fades away even further, and Fluttershy realizes that his new, non-chaotic persona is slowly destroying him. Unfortunately, Discord is unfazed by this development and continues to act normal, despite the effect it is having on him.\n In an effort to stop Discord from fading, Fluttershy begs him to do something chaotic, but his ghostlike appearance prevents him from doing so. Therefore, Fluttershy starts causing her own chaos around Discord's house\u2014knocking over teacups, talking to her own reflections, disorganizing the furniture, and nailing chairs to the ceiling. This inspires Discord's old chaotic self, and he starts to recorporealize. Once he's back to physical form, he joins in the fun and brings back the singing ginseng tea bags and floating furniture.\n When Discord mentions that his style of party throwing is the complete opposite of Fluttershy's, Fluttershy says she never expected him to throw a party like her because of how different they are. Discord fears driving Fluttershy away because of their differences\u2014because their friendship doesn't make sense. But Fluttershy reveals that he's introduced her to so many things since they became friends and that she likes him because of their differences.With Discord back to his old self, he throws a proper Chaosville tea party for himself and Fluttershy, replete with sneezing pi\u00f1atas, singing tea bags, and upside-down sandwich butterfly-catching games.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Apple Bloom walking through the busy Ponyville marketplace, where she meets a friendly elderly pony named Grand Pear selling pear jam. Originally from Ponyville himself, Grand Pear says he recently moved back to town from Vanhoover for \"a change of pace\". He gives Apple Bloom a jar of pear jam\u2014free of charge\u2014and Apple Bloom bids him a fond farewell before leaving.\nBack at Sweet Apple Acres, Applejack and Big McIntosh make pancakes for dinner. When Apple Bloom returns with the pear jam to use as a pancake topping, Applejack and Big Mac suddenly panic. They seize the jam jar and hide it under the kitchen floorboards before Granny Smith discovers it. Applejack explains to the confused Apple Bloom that there is a long-standing feud between the Apple family and Pear family, though she and Big Mac admit that they're not sure why.\n After her friendly encounter with Grand Pear, Apple Bloom wants to know what happened between the Apples and Pears. Because Granny Smith would get upset any time she was asked about it, the Apple siblings decide to ask family historian Goldie Delicious. The next morning, Applejack, Apple Bloom, and Big McIntosh travel to Goldie Delicious' cabin and ask her about the feud between the Apples and Pears. Goldie is nervous about going behind Granny Smith's back, but she decides to tell the Apple siblings the story.\nLong ago, Sweet Apple Acres was located directly next to the Pear family's pear farm, but the Apple and Pear families were constantly at odds with each other over who were the better farmers, especially Granny Smith and Grand Pear. The only two members of each family to get along were Pear Butter of the Pears and Bright Mac of the Apples\u2014the Apple siblings' mother and father, respectively.\n Goldie Delicious explains to the Apple siblings that, despite the heated rivalry between their families, their childhood friendship eventually blossomed into a beautiful romance. However, she is unable to give them more details, so she tells them to talk with firewood salespony Burnt Oak, their father's old friend. Back in Ponyville, Applejack, Apple Bloom, and Big McIntosh meet with Burnt Oak in the marketplace and ask about their father. In another flashback, Bright Mac and Burnt Oak have a plow race across the apple fields, but Bright Mac gets distracted by Pear Butter in the nearby pear fields and accidentally crashes into a water silo, causing the pear fields to get flooded. Before Grand Pear can blame Pear Butter for this, Bright Mac steps in to take responsibility. After chewing out Bright Mac, Grand Pear takes Pear Butter away from the scene, forbidding his daughter's relationship with the Apple stallion.\nIn present day, Applejack realizes that she inherited her father's honesty, and Burnt Oak explains that Bright Mac spent the next several weeks repairing the Pear family's water silo and growing closer to Pear Butter. When the Apple siblings ask for more details about their mother, Burnt Oak suggests that they talk to Mrs. Cake, who was friends with Pear Butter when they were young. Just before leaving, Big Mac asks Burnt Oak if it would be okay for them to come by again and listen to more of his stories, and Oak happily obliges.\n At Sugarcube Corner, Applejack, Apple Bloom, and Big Mac meet with Mrs. Cake and ask about their mother. Mrs. Cake reveals that their mother originally convinced her to pursue baking and helped her get her cutie mark, and Apple Bloom realizes that she inherited her mother's love of helping others find their calling.\nIn another flashback, Pear Butter helps Mrs. Cake\u2014then named Chiffon Swirl\u2014perfect many of her baking recipes. One day, Chiffon goes to surprise Pear Butter with a thank-you cake, and she finds her having a romantic picnic with Bright Mac in a field between their families' farms. They discover Chiffon hiding in the bushes, and Chiffon promises to keep their relationship a secret. However, Granny Smith wanders by while picking apples and, upon seeing Bright Mac and Pear Butter together, drags her son away.\n Despite this, the two continue to see each other in secret. On the anniversary of when they first met, Pear Butter sings a soft love ballad on guitar for Bright Mac, and Bright Mac leads her to a spot where he carved their cutie marks into a rock, revealing their strong romantic feelings for one another. Unfortunately, some time later, Grand Pear tells Pear Butter that they're moving away to Vanhoover not only to expand their family's pear business but also to get away from the Apple family.\n A heartbroken Pear Butter informs Bright Mac of her father's decision to move the Pears to Vanhoover, being forced to choose family over him. In the present day, before Mrs. Cake tells the Apple siblings any more, she tells them to ask Mayor Mare for the rest of the story. At Ponyville Town Hall, Mayor Mare tells the Apple siblings about the role she played in their parents' love story.\nIn the last flashback, on the night before the Pear family moves away, Bright Mac organizes a secret wedding ceremony at the edge of Sweet Apple Acres, with Burnt Oak and Chiffon Swirl as witnesses and Mayor Mare as the officiant. He asks Pear Butter to marry him, and she happily accepts. As part of their wedding vows, they plant an apple seed and a pear seed next to each other.\n Just as Mayor Mare declares them husband and wife, Grand Pear and Granny Smith discover the ceremony and voice their extreme displeasure. Before Grand Pear can drag Pear Butter away, she says the Apples are her family now, and being forced by her father to choose between being an Apple and being a Pear, she tearfully chooses the Apples. Angered by his daughter's decision, Grand Pear leaves, leaving Pear Butter behind to be comforted by Bright Mac and a sympathetic Granny Smith.\nIn present day, the Apple siblings are shocked by everything they've heard, and they decide to confront both of their grandparents over this matter. Back at the Ponyville marketplace, Apple Bloom asks Grand Pear about his real reason for coming back to Ponyville. Grand Pear confesses that he wanted to make up for his past mistakes and get to know his estranged grandchildren. Upon hearing this, the Apple siblings hug their grandfather.\n At Sweet Apple Acres, the Apple siblings reunite Granny Smith and Grand Pear.

After putting an end to their ice cream and cupcake-flinging, Twilight helps them make amends, concluding with the lesson that \"friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt it's worth fighting for\". As Toola Roola and Coconut Cream make up, Twilight realizes her own lesson sounds familiar.\nReturning to the Castle of Friendship, Twilight finds her and her friends' old friendship journal gathering dust on a bookshelf and shows it to Starlight Glimmer. She remembers the lesson she just gave to Toola Roola and Coconut Cream was the same lesson she herself learned when they first fought Discord. However, the journal has become old and worn due to its recent disuse.\n Twilight and Starlight gather the rest of their friends in the castle throne room and show them the worn-out friendship journal. After Rainbow Dash comments on the journal's disorganized and at times hard-to-read contents, Starlight uses her magic to create fresh, crisp copies of the journal for each of the Mane Six. As the ponies reminisce about the many lessons they've learned together, Twilight comes up with the idea of making the journal available for everyone in Equestria to read so that they can also benefit from the lessons within. The other ponies are in full support of this idea.\nThrough Twilight's efforts, the journal is published and distributed to bookstores and newspaper stands in Cloudsdale, Canterlot, and Manehattan. As Twilight hands out copies of the journal to foals outside the Ponyville Schoolhouse, she overhears Toola Roola and Coconut Cream arguing again, and she encourages them to read some lessons in the journal for advice.\n With the popularity that the journal is bringing them, the Cutie Mark Crusaders have even more applicants for their upcoming cutie mark summer camp. While Twilight is pleased that her and her friends' lessons are reaching so many ponies, she is discouraged by how the lessons are being applied and hopes that ponies are actually learning from them. While walking through town, Twilight and Starlight meet a group of fanatical ponies from Fillydelphia who ask Twilight to autograph their journal copies. When Twilight asks what their favorite lesson was, the ponies admit they haven't actually read the journal and plan to keep their copies as mere collector's items. Elsewhere in town, two ponies sitting at a cafe table comment on the journal's illumination into the Mane Six's lives but also remark that they wish Rarity's sections were excluded. Rarity, sitting just a few feet away from them, is heartbroken and runs off in tears.\nTwilight chases after Rarity to console her, but she is intercepted by Pinkie Pie, whose lessons have also brought her \"giggly feedback\". Pinkie is pleased that so many ponies think she's funny, but when they laugh at every single thing she says, it becomes unnerving. Meanwhile, Rainbow Dash is harassed and followed around by little fillies\u2014they ask her about the exploits she's written about while ignoring the lessons that the rest of the Mane Six wrote.\n Elsewhere, a group of journal readers accost Fluttershy, claiming that she \"keeps learning the same thing over and over again\", and accuse her of not being assertive enough. Before Twilight and Starlight can stand up for her, Fluttershy stands up for herself, arguing to the ponies that her journey to assertiveness was a slow one, not an instant one.\n Twilight and Starlight go to Carousel Boutique, where Rarity has taken to \"stress sewing\" as a way to work through her despair. Because of the negative reception of Rarity's lessons in the friendship journal, multiple ponies have cancelled their orders from her and are even boycotting her fashion designs.\nConversely, Applejack has become immensely popular because of her lessons, and dozens of ponies have flocked to Sweet Apple Acres to become members of the Apple family, calling themselves the \"Sweet Apple Admirers\". Unfortunately, this popularity has caused Applejack, Apple Bloom, Big McIntosh, and Granny Smith to run themselves ragged trying to provide them all with food and cider.\n Twilight returns to the castle and confides in Starlight Glimmer, regretting ever publishing the journal in the first place. Starlight assures her that it isn't her fault, but Twilight is convinced that it is and that she's made her friends' lives miserable. The rest of the Mane Six soon arrive at the castle seeking refuge from both their overbearing fans and mudslinging critics. Twilight is even more convinced that this situation is her fault for publishing the journal, but Starlight says it's everyone else's fault for focusing on the wrong aspects of her friends' lessons. This gives Starlight an idea, and she teleports away.\n Twilight goes outside to try and calming the arguing ponies down. When asked by a reporter for the Canterlot Chronicle why she moved to Ponyville, she says it was to learn about friendship, which is why the friendship journal even exists. However, the reporter argues that Twilight's \"character\" would have been more interesting if she stayed in Canterlot. This comment annoys Twilight, who argues that she and her friends are real ponies, not characters in a book.\nAs the ponies continue to argue, Twilight and her friends interrupt with a song, singing that they are not flawless but their flaws make them special and their friendship possible. Unfortunately, this does nothing to appease the ponies, and they immediately go back to arguing.\n When the Mane Six go back inside the castle, Starlight Glimmer returns with Toola Roola and Coconut Cream. The two fillies express their utmost gratitude to the ponies; after reading their lessons in the journal, their friendship is stronger than ever. Twilight and her friends are very pleased to know that someone learned from the lessons they published, and they come to the conclusion that \"fads come and go, friendship is forever\". When Applejack wonders what they're going to do about the ponies arguing outside, Twilight says they can wait a little longer and suggests enjoying the moment.\n"}, {"summary": "The episode begins in Ponyville, where Spike\u2014official friendship ambassador to the dragons\u2014is overseeing preparations for Ember's arrival. Because of the dragons' inherently competitive nature, they are having difficulty embracing friendship, so Spike has invited Ember to Ponyville to give her advice. Despite Spike's nervousness, Twilight Sparkle and Starlight Glimmer are certain that he can handle it.\n Just then, Thorax appears, and Spike remembers that he also invited him to Ponyville, not realizing that he'd extended invitations to both the Dragon Lord and the leader of the changelings on the same day. Spike is afraid that Ember's aggressive and intimidating personality will clash with Thorax's kind and sensitive nature to the point that it will spark a conflict between dragons and changelings. As Spike talks to Thorax about his recent leadership troubles, he sees Ember approaching from the sky. He urges Thorax toward the Castle of Friendship so Twilight can give him a tour.\nMeanwhile, Spike and Starlight welcome Ember to town, but she immediately scares some townsfolk with her fire breath and aversion to bright colors. She asks where Twilight is, and Spike inadvertently mentions that she's at her castle.\n At the castle, Spike makes certain that the coast is clear before inviting Ember inside. He treats her to a welcoming banquet of treats, but Ember mostly eats the food bowls and castle walls made of gems. As Ember helps herself to the \"banquet\", Spike excuses himself. Meanwhile, Twilight shows Thorax her favorite chairs in the castle library. Spike enters and suddenly pulls Twilight away, informing her that Ember is in the castle.\nBecause Ember wants to talk to Twilight and Thorax wants to talk to Spike, Spike suggests that he and Twilight switch places. All of a sudden, the scales on Spike's head start to glow, and a holographic image of Spike appears floating over the Cutie Map.\nStarlight enters to see the map summoning Spike to Ponyville, and Spike starts to panic. He asks Twilight and Starlight to keep Ember and Thorax distracted and away from each other while he seeks out the friendship problem he's been summoned to solve. While walking through town, he finds Lyra Heartstrings and Sweetie Drops having an argument over cupcakes.\n Back in the castle dining hall, Twilight meets with Ember, who\u2014despite the banquet that was prepared for her\u2014feels like she is being avoided. Twilight assures her that everyone is just getting everything ready for her welcoming party later on, and she offers to show Ember around town. Meanwhile, Starlight returns to Thorax in the library, tells him that Twilight and Spike are busy with paperwork, and offers to take him to lunch. Thorax accepts, but he is disappointed over not being able to talk with Spike.\nIn town, Spike successfully resolves Lyra and Sweetie Drops' disagreement, but his scales don't glow, meaning he hasn't completed his friendship mission. With Starlight and Thorax having lunch nearby, Thorax takes the opportunity to talk to Spike, and he mentions having trouble dealing with a renegade group of changelings who still feed on love. Elsewhere, Ember tries to make friends with other ponies, but her boldness and aggressiveness scares them away. Twilight and Starlight try to help, but Ember accidentally angers them when she fails to tell them apart.\n Back at the cafe, Spike zones out in the middle of Thorax's rambling and sees Crusoe Palm and \"Rainbow Stars\" arguing over a table seat. Spike helps them resolve their issue, but his scales still don't glow. Thorax is impressed by Spike's conflict resolution skills and asks for advice on how to deal his own problems. However, before Spike can offer any, he notices Ember approaching and quickly excuses himself to join her. Ember gets upset at Spike for avoiding her all day, but Spike assures her that he hasn't. Feeling accused of being a liar, Ember loudly snaps at him. Thorax hears this and jumps to Spike's defense, transforming into a ferocious bear and charging at Ember.\nBefore Ember and Thorax attack each other, Spike yells for them to stop, and they realize that they are both trying to protect Spike from harm. Spike finally admits that he accidentally invited them to Ponyville on the same day and has been trying to keep them apart for fear that they wouldn't get along. Ember gets offended that Spike thinks she's so bad at friendship that Thorax wouldn't like her and flies off. Likewise, Thorax gets upset due to Spike reinforcing his personality and leadership issues and also flies away. Spike laments over having driven both of his newest friends away.\n Ember meets with Thorax next to Saddle Lake, and Thorax admits he doesn't want to go home because of his recent leadership troubles. Ember is surprised to learn that Thorax is a leader and tells him to be more assertive, reminding him of how he turned into a bear to defend Spike. When Thorax asks Ember about her own problems, she says she doesn't want to talk about it. Thorax urges her to do so, explaining that talking things out is more effective than the dragons' usual method of winning duels and humiliating others.\nEmber and Thorax take each other's advice and decide to confront Spike once more.\n As Spike and his friends take down the town decorations, Ember and Thorax appear before him. Using the advice they gave one another, Ember talks about her feelings regarding the day's events, and Thorax assertively scolds Spike for his blundering. Spike fully accepts responsibility for his mistakes and asks for his friends' forgiveness. Ember and Thorax forgive Spike, and Thorax cements the three's friendship with a group hug, much to Ember's discomfort. With this, Spike's scales glow, signifying a successful friendship mission.\nSome time later, a ceremony is held in the Ponyville town square, where Spike extends the flame of friendship to both Ember and Thorax, uniting dragons and changelings in harmony.

Rarity and Sweetie Belle also soon arrive, with Rarity having packed lighter than their first camping trip. Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo are also nearby picking berries. After their first camping trip together, Scootaloo is still nervous about the woods' potential dangers, but her \"big sister\" Rainbow says she'll look after her.\n As the ponies finish setting up camp, however, they are suddenly surrounded by a large swarm of Fly-ders\u2014spiders with wings. They take shelter from the swarm's bites and webs in a nearby cave. Applejack explains that the typically Luna Bay Area-indigenous Fly-ders were probably attracted by the camp food and that they'll have to wait until the swarm moves on, much to Apple Bloom's disappointment.\nAfter making a campfire, Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash offer to tell the fillies stories to pass the time. Applejack starts off by telling her and Apple Bloom's favorite legend: the legend of Rockhoof.\n In Applejack's story, Rockhoof is a scrawny Earth pony colt who lives in a village at the foot of a giant volcano. The village is protected by a group of elite pony guards called the Mighty Helm. Rockhoof dreamed of becoming a member of the Helm, but his weak stature and inability to lift an axe got in the way, bringing him ridicule from the other guardponies.\nOne day, while Rockhoof was digging holes with his shovel, the volcano explosively erupts, threatening to cover the village in lava. Unable to think of a way to save the village, the Mighty Helm orders its immediate evacuation, but the villagers are reluctant to leave the home where they spent their entire lives. Rockhoof, however, uses his shovel to start digging a trench to divert the lava away from the village, even though he couldn't dig fast enough.\n Suddenly, in the middle of Rockhoof's digging, a mysterious magic surrounds his shovel, and he transforms from a scrawny colt to a brawny stallion. With his newfound strength, Rockhoof is able to dig multiple times faster than before, and he successfully diverts the lava into the ocean. For his bravery and determination, Rockhoof is invited to join the Mighty Helm's ranks. Back in the cave, Applejack's friends are very entertained by her story. Unfortunately, the Fly-der swarm has not yet moved on outside, having covered the ponies' entire campsite in spider webs. Sweetie Belle is disappointed to have abandoned their beautifully-made camp for such a drab-looking cave, but Rarity assures her that there is beauty in everything, which she demonstrates by uncovering flecks of gold in the cave walls and making shadow puppets. To further illustrate her point, Rarity decides to tell Sweetie Belle her favorite legend: the legend of Mistmane.\n In Rarity's story, Mistmane is a talented unicorn sorceress who is hailed and beloved as the most beautiful pony in Equestria. Some time after being accepted into a prestigious magic school, Mistmane receives a letter saying her best friend Sable Spirit was crowned empress of her old village home. However, when she returns home, she finds it a dismal dictatorship where the empress keeps the villagers working all hours on her palace and takes everything with beauty for herself.\nMistmane confronts Sable Spirit in her palace and demands an explanation. Sable explains that she was always jealous of Mistmane's beauty and talent, and after she left for magic school, Sable used a spell to make herself beautiful. The spell backfired, however, and made her hideous. Therefore, she decided if she couldn't have beauty, she would take it from everyone and everything else. Mistmane refuses to allow this, and she faces Sable Spirit in a magic duel. After a fierce clash of fire- and water-conjuring spells, Mistmane wins by trapping Sable in a cocoon of plant roots.\n Afterward, Mistmane plants a flower at the center of the village and uses her magic to restore its beauty\u2014as well as Sable Spirit's\u2014while also sacrificing her own beauty. Sable Spirit is so moved by Mistmane's sacrifice that she rules with kindness and compassion from then on. Though Mistmane is no longer physically beautiful, she dedicates her life to spreading beauty all over Equestria. Sweetie Belle is very moved by Rarity's story, declaring Mistmane to be her favorite legend as well. Suddenly, the Fly-der swarm outside the cave starts to make its way inside. Rainbow Dash collapses the cave entrance to block their entry, but she and her friends are now trapped inside the cave. As Scootaloo gives in to overwhelming panic, Rainbow Dash tries to calm her down and cheer her up by telling her favorite legend: the legend of Flash Magnus.\n In Rainbow Dash's story, Flash Magnus is a cadet in the Cloudsdale Royal Legion during a time before the founding of the Wonderbolts. One day, while flying over the Dragon Lands to reach their teammates on the other side, the Legion is intercepted and attacked by dragons, including Torch. Several members of the Legion are captured and taken to the dragons' lair.\nFlash Magnus wants to rescue their captured comrades, but Commander Ironhead forbids it, saying the dragons are too powerful to challenge head-on. Therefore, Flash volunteers to lure the dragons away from their lair so that Ironhead and the rest of the Legion can retrieve their friends. Ironhead recognizes Flash's bravery and gives him the fireproof shield Netitus to assist in his mission.\n After Flash gets the dragons' attention and lures them away from their lair, Ironhead and his soldiers infiltrate the cave. Once the captured Legionnaires are saved, Ironhead and the Legion gather together a large collection of storm clouds, which Flash leads the pursuing dragons into. Overwhelmed by lightning, the dragons retreat. Flash is praised by his fellow Legionnaires for his bravery, and Commander Ironhead allows him to keep the Netitus shield.\nScootaloo is indeed cheered up by Rainbow Dash's story, and Rainbow says Flash Magnus has always inspired her to be brave and awesome. When Applejack no longer hears the Fly-ders buzzing outside the cave, she realizes the swarm has finally left. However, with the front entrance blocked off, the ponies decide to venture deeper into the cave to find another way out. Scootaloo is nervous about this, but Rainbow Dash tells her to be brave like Flash Magnus.\n The ponies eventually come across a stream that empties into the rushing waters of Winsome Falls. Applejack apologizes to the Cutie Mark Crusaders for the disappointing camping trip, but the fillies say they enjoyed themselves and want to stay. Inspired by the legendary stories they just heard, the Crusaders decide to make the most of their situation and have fun in the areas around Winsome Falls."}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Starlight Glimmer and Trixie teleporting to the Changeling Kingdom to pay a surprise visit to Thorax and the changelings. In his letters to Starlight, Thorax has written that not only is he dealing with the responsibilities of being a leader but also the threat of a half-bear, half-mole creature called a maulwurf that keeps eating the changelings' plants. Trixie, however, is skeptical about the existence of such a creature.\nJust then, an unreformed changeling appears before Starlight and Trixie, hissing menacingly at them. Starlight tries to fend off the attacking changeling with her magic, and Trixie tries to teleport them away, but the changeling quickly captures them. He takes them before Thorax, believing them to be trespassers, but Thorax says they are friends and to let them go. He apologizes to Starlight and Trixie for the rude welcome, explaining that the unreformed changeling is his older brother Pharynx.\n Thorax says he has taken Ember's advice to be more assertive and dealt with most of the renegade changelings, but Pharynx is the only one who still refuses to adopt the hive's new way of sharing love. As a result, all of the other changelings avoid him. Thorax gives Starlight and Trixie a tour of the new Changeling Kingdom. Having abandoned their previous routines of hunting and patrolling, the changelings have adopted a variety of new activities including theater, dancing, arts and crafts, and the occasional potluck. Unfortunately, Pharynx constantly undermines these new ways, upsetting the rest of the changelings. Thorax fears if he can't convince Pharynx to accept love and friendship, it will cause the hive to question his leadership.\nWhile Thorax and his subjects leave to lure the maulwurf away from the kingdom, Trixie and Starlight offer to talk with Pharynx. The ponies approach the rebellious changeling and try to connect with him, having their own experiences with being outsiders among their own kind. However, despite their lives being richer for letting go of the past, Pharynx considers them both losers and tells them to stay away from him.\n When Thorax returns, he shows Starlight and Trixie to the changelings' \"feelings forum\", where members of the hive come together to talk about their issues in a welcoming and open-minded environment. While the participants in the forum feel good talking about their problems, they are also very open about their grievances toward Pharynx. Pharynx enters to find his fellow changelings talking behind his back and voices his own outrage about the hive's weak and cowardly new ways. When Pharynx leaves, the rest of the changelings demand that he be banished from the Changeling Kingdom.\n When the feelings forum is adjourned, Starlight regretfully considers the possibility that Pharynx is a lost cause and simply cannot be changed. Trixie agrees, and they decide to tell Thorax that he may have no choice than to banish his older brother. As they leave to talk to Thorax, Pharynx is revealed to have been listening in on their conversation.\nAt Thorax's throne, Starlight and Trixie try to talk to him about Pharynx, and Thorax tells them a story about his and Pharynx's childhood. When they were little, while Pharynx occasionally made fun of Thorax for his sensitivity, he also protected him from other changelings' similar ridicule. Despite his rebelliousness, Thorax is certain that Pharynx loves him in his own way and that there is good in him. Moved by Thorax's story, Starlight changes her mind about pushing for Pharynx's banishment and comes up with another idea.\n Outside the kingdom, Starlight lays a trail of leaves to lure the maulwurf to the hive. Her plan is to have Pharynx save the hive from the maulwurf so that the rest of the changelings will finally accept him. Unfortunately, Trixie cannot find Pharynx anywhere; having overheard their earlier conversation, Pharynx has apparently left the kingdom on his own.\n Starlight and Trixie inform Thorax of this development; while the changelings are thrilled that Pharynx is gone, they are terrified that the maulwurf is headed their way. Upon learning that his brother is somewhere alone in the Badlands while the maulwurf is on the loose, he goes to save him, and Starlight and Trixie follow. The rest of the changelings, however, are too scared to also come along. Starlight attempts to rally the nervous changelings with an inspiring speech, saying that while they were forced to follow Queen Chrysalis against their will, Thorax's rule gives them the freedom to choose.\nUnfortunately, the changelings are unmoved by the speech, and Starlight, Trixie, and Thorax head out to find Pharynx by themselves. Somewhere in the desert, they find Pharynx battling the rampaging maulwurf on his own. Starlight, Trixie, and Thorax try to help him, but the maulwurf's thick hide makes it impervious to most of their attacks. Suddenly, the rest of the changeling swarm appears to provide support, but they are unable to help much due to being out of combat practice.\n Pharynx comes up with an idea inspired by how he used to tease Thorax when they were little, and the changeling brothers team up to make the maulwurf hit itself over and over. When the maulwurf's stamina is worn down enough, it retreats underground. Thorax asks Pharynx why he challenged the maulwurf if he was leaving the hive. Pharynx explains that he couldn't just let it attack them; despite his distaste for the kingdom's new ways, he still cares about the hive and its safety. The other changelings admit their fault for dismissing Pharynx, saying they still need a protector from outside threats. Pharynx is so moved by the hive's acceptance of him that he transforms into a form similar to theirs.\nStarlight apologizes to Pharynx for calling him a lost cause, and Pharynx thanks Thorax for not giving up on him. In recognition of his acceptance of the hive's new ways, he decides to share stories of his and Thorax's childhood.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode opens with Pinkie Pie buying a copy of the Ponyville Chronicle newspaper and mentioning to Rainbow Dash the various goings-on around Equestria, though Rainbow is largely uninterested. When Pinkie reads the headline \"Author A. K. Yearling Announces Retirement\", Rainbow's interest is instantly sparked.\n Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie race to A. K. Yearling's jungle cottage, with Rainbow believing her sudden retirement is covering up something terrible. At the cottage, Rainbow frantically knocks at the door, and Yearling invites them inside with a depressed expression. When asked why she's retiring so suddenly before her next book is published, Yearling explains that her latest adventure in Southern Equestria turned up multiple news articles disparaging Daring Do and blaming her for the damage that her adventures cause. This has caused her to lose confidence in herself as both an adventurer and as a writer.\nRainbow Dash is certain that the ponies Daring Do has helped far outnumber those she unintentionally harmed, and she suggests traveling to Southern Equestria to disprove the rumors circulating about her.\n Upon arriving in the desert village of Somnambula, Rainbow Dash starts asking around about Daring Do, but the villagers condemn her for destroying several objects around the village, including the sacred statue of its legendary namesake. One of the villagers\u2014a mysterious stallion in a red cloak\u2014supports these claims, calling Daring Do \"a menace who destroys everything she touches\". A. K. Yearling's confidence is broken even more, and she runs out of the village in shame.\nDetermined to make Yearling realize that ponies appreciate Daring Do, Rainbow and Pinkie follow her to the Get On Inn, a barn-and-breakfast where she commonly stays during her adventures. There, they talk to the manager Mrs. Trotsworth about Daring Do, and Mrs. Trotsworth criticizes her for not only leaving without paying her bill but also luring a band of ruffians that destroyed half the rooms looking for her. In addition, there have also been recent reports of Daring Do stealing glowpaz from villagers looking to offer it to Somnambula's statue.\n Rainbow and Pinkie find A. K. Yearling at an inn table, and they overhear the same red-cloaked stallion from earlier continue to publicly condemn Daring Do to the villagers. Yearling denies all allegations of stealing glowpaz, and Rainbow assures her that they'll fix all of this after a good night's sleep. The next morning, Rainbow, Pinkie, Yearling, and the villagers congregate at the broken Somnambula statue in the village square. There, the stallion in the red cloak continues to publicly slander Daring Do's name. Rainbow Dash steps forward to challenge the cloaked stallion's claims, arguing that Daring Do's actions have been nothing but heroic. However, when she belittles the destroyed statue, one of the villagers speaks up to defend the legendary pony that the village was named after.\nLong ago, the once-unnamed village fell under siege by an evil sphinx that demanded most of their crops as tribute. To keep the poor villagers from giving up hope, Somnambula used what little she had to give them food. Prince Hisan, the son of the pharaoh, was so moved by Somnambula's compassion that he stood up to the sphinx to free the villagers from her tyranny. However, the sphinx captured Hisan and told the pharaoh that she would only set him free if someone solved her riddle.\n Somnambula volunteered to try and solve the sphinx's riddle: \"I shine brightest in the dark. I am there but cannot be seen. To have me costs you nothing. To be without me costs you everything.\" Somnambula correctly answers \"hope\", enraging the sphinx. Fearing that the sphinx would go back on her promise to release Hisan, Somnambula asks for another challenge and tells the sphinx to leave the kingdom forever if she completes it. The sphinx challenges Somnambula to walk across a bridge to Hisan\u2014blindfolded and without the use of her wings.\nGuided by Hisan's voice and the power of hope, Somnambula succeeds, and the sphinx flies off in a rage. Hisan replaces Somnambula's pearls with a string of glowpaz as thanks for saving him, and glowpaz became the village's symbol of hope from then on.\n Rainbow reminds the villagers of how both Daring Do and Somnambula fought to protect their home, but the stallion in the red cloak reminds them of how Daring Do destroyed the statue in the first place. As the villagers curse Daring Do's name, A. K. Yearling walks off with her reputation in ruins. Rainbow Dash finally confronts the cloaked stallion about his vendetta against Daring Do, and he reveals himself to be Dr. Caballeron. He thanks Rainbow for helping him break Daring Do's spirit once and for all, and he and his henchponies capture her before she can tell Daring the truth.\nAs Rainbow cries out for help, Pinkie Pie and A. K. Yearling see Caballeron and his henchponies drag her away. Pinkie follows Caballeron through the desert, and Daring Do\u2014discarding her A. K. Yearling persona\u2014follows shortly afterward. After the damage done to her reputation, Daring is unsure of herself, but Pinkie reminds her that she'd never let anything bad happen to Rainbow. With this boost in confidence, Daring pursues Caballeron to the pyramid, where he has trapped Rainbow Dash in the same way that the sphinx trapped Hisan in Somnambula's story.\n Rainbow Dash starts to slowly sink into a pit of green slime, and the sphinx's magic still prevents the use of wings. Inspired by Somnambula's story, Daring Do and Pinkie Pie take a leap of faith, using steam vents to jump across the slime pit and save Rainbow. A short while later, the three intercept Caballeron and his henchponies as they leave the village. Glowpaz spills out of the large bag they're dragging, revealing them to be the ones who stole from the villagers.\nCaballeron reveals that his defamation of Daring Do's name was to remove her from the picture so he could carry out his plans unhindered. However, Daring Do has gotten her confidence back, and with his evil plans exposed and the villagers turned against him, Caballeron runs off in defeat.\n The villagers of Somnambula cheer for Daring Do, and she thanks Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie for helping her. Daring vows to try and be more responsible for her actions in the future and to never lose hope if she does something she didn't mean to do. With that lesson, she decides not to retire from writing books, and she uses her personal funds to replace the village's damaged carts, reimburse Mrs. Trotsworth, and restore the Somnambula statue."}, {"summary": " The episode opens in Ponyville, where ponies are crowding around Daisy, Lily Valley, and Rose's flower stand and buying flowers for Mares Day. As the flower ponies are overwhelmed by customers, Rarity arrives to help with \"color consultations\". Once the crowd thins, Rarity orders some lavender for an upcoming photo shoot with Photo Finish for Vanity Mare, a magazine that showcases the most beautiful manes in Equestria. She also buys a large fan from Mr. Breezy and a new chaise lounge from Davenport and helps them with their businesses in the process.\n At Sugarcube Corner, Rarity seeks to buy some snacks for Photo Finish's arrival, but she finds Pinkie Pie celebrating Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake's \"sneeze-iversary\"\u2014the anniversary of their first sneeze. As part of the occasion, she sprays silly string all over the bakery, covering herself, Rarity, and the Cake twins in sticky, hard-to-remove string. Rarity, worried about her photo shoot the next day, suggests visiting Zecora for some special shampoo for her and a magical cleaning solution for Pinkie Pie.\n At Zecora's hut in the Everfree Forest, Zecora presents to them two bottles of liquid\u2014one containing sudsy shampoo for Rarity's mane and one containing magical removing potion for Pinkie Pie's silly string. When Zecora mentions some horrific examples of trying to fix one's mane with magic, Rarity is frightened, causing her to knock the two bottles off the table. She picks up one bottle and quickly heads out the door, leaving Pinkie Pie to depart with the other bottle.\nBack at Sugarcube Corner, Pinkie and the Cake twins use the solution in Zecora's bottle to clean up the silly string. But instead of removing the string, it lathers like shampoo. Meanwhile, at Carousel Boutique, Rarity uses the other bottle on her mane in the shower, and when she emerges, she discovers in horror that almost all of her mane hair has fallen out.\n Rarity returns to Zecora's hut to find out why this happened, and when Zecora sees Rarity's mane, she realizes that the shampoo and removing potion bottles had gotten mixed up. Rarity asks Zecora to make a cure, believing her situation can be easily fixed, but Zecora reminds Rarity that mane-fixing magic is not simple and will take time. She tells Rarity to go and finish her errands while she brews an antidote in the meantime. While Rarity feels certain that Zecora's cure will be ready in time for her photo shoot, she is nervous about walking in public with a ruined mane. While walking through the marketplace in a disguise, she is cut in line at Rose's flower stand, called \"non-fabulous\" at Mr. Breezy's store, and outbid for her new chaise lounge at Davenport's store.\nRarity goes to the Castle of Friendship to lament her situation to Twilight Sparkle and Starlight Glimmer. Desperate, Rarity asks Twilight and Starlight to use their magic to try and restore her mane, despite Zecora's warnings. Unfortunately, they are unable to make a new mane for Rarity without taking the mane of someone else. To make matters worse, Zecora arrives and explains that she can't restore Rarity's mane in time for her photo shoot; Rarity will have to wait until her mane grows back on its own.\n A short while later, Rarity brings her situation to Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy's attention, and they agree to help as well. Applejack offers Rarity a wig, Rainbow Dash makes a mane out of clouds, and Fluttershy's animal friends make a mane out of leaves and twigs. However, none of their ideas seem worthy of Vanity Mare magazine, and Rarity considers cancelling the photo shoot altogether. Later that day, Twilight and the others go to Carousel Boutique to offer Rarity their moral support. As Rarity sulks in the dark with tubs of ice cream, her friends tell her that her mane isn't the only thing about her. They remind her of her growing fashion empire, how she makes her friends feel beautiful with her dresses, and how she generously gave up her tail for a crying sea serpent. Moved by her friends' words, Rarity decides to adopt a new, punk-inspired look so that she can \"shine from the inside out\".\n Rarity goes back to town to show off her new look and give more help to her friends in the marketplace, including Filthy Rich and Mr. Breezy. Despite missing out on Vanity Mare, she thanks her friends for reminding her that she can look good on the outside as long as she feels good on the inside. When Twilight asks how Rarity used magical remover potion on herself, Rarity remembers Pinkie Pie, and the ponies return to Sugarcube Corner to find it a mess of silly string and shampoo bubbles.\n Several months later, Rarity's mane has grown back to its original state. At a newspaper stand, Rarity discovers her punk-style mane from months earlier gracing the front cover of Vanity Mare magazine, even though she had cancelled her shoot with Photo Finish. Her friends reveal that they talked to Photo Finish about her new mane and positive outlook, and Photo Finish took pictures of Rarity from the bushes.\nRarity thanks her friends for their help as ponies in Ponyville walk around with similar punk-styled manes.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins at a swamp where Zecora helps Fluttershy collect crisscross moss for the Sweet Feather Sanctuary. During her moss collection, Zecora slips and falls into the swamp water, and she floats past a lilypad flower that sprays her with pollen. When Zecora emerges from the water, she suddenly finds herself covered in orange spots, much to Fluttershy's alarm.\nLater, at Dr. Horse's office, Zecora has starting coughing up bubbles. After an examination, the doctor diagnoses Zecora with Swamp Fever, a rare disease characterized by orange spots, bubble-coughs, and shock-sneezes. In the disease's final stage, the victim transforms into a tree that drops the flowers that spread the disease. Even worse, no cure for Swamp Fever has been discovered.\n Feeling guilty for getting Zecora sick, Fluttershy promises to find someone who can help. Zecora tells her about a legendary masked healer from long ago who cured many diseases before mysteriously vanishing without a trace. Fluttershy knows of the legend of this \"Mystical Mask\" from stories that her parents told her when she was little. Fluttershy and Zecora believe the Mystical Mask really exists, and Fluttershy is determined to seek her out. At the Castle of Friendship, Fluttershy interrupts a cooking competition between Twilight Sparkle and Spike and asks for help in learning more about the Mystical Mask. Unfortunately, after several hours of searching the castle library, Twilight and Fluttershy fail to find anything. Twilight suggests turning in for some well-needed sleep, but Fluttershy refuses to rest until Zecora is healed.\nThe next morning, Fluttershy excitedly wakes up Twilight and tells her that she has discovered the Mystical Mask's true identity: Mage Meadowbrook, the legendary sorceress of Hayseed Swamp who disappeared a long time ago. Fluttershy wants to head to the swamp to see if Meadowbrook left anything behind. Twilight mentions Fluttershy's lack of sleep, but Fluttershy still refuses to rest and urges Twilight out the door.\n Before leaving for Hayseed Swamp, Fluttershy and Twilight check in on Zecora, whose condition has worsened to the point where she is sneezing bolts of lightning and unable to speak in rhyme. As Fluttershy and Twilight hurriedly take their leave, Fluttershy bumps into Zecora's door due to her sleep deprivation.\nFluttershy and Twilight fly to Hayseed Swamp and find a seemingly abandoned bayou village. They discover Mage Meadowbrook's old home built out of a large, twisted tree. Inside, they find samples of the same flower that infected Zecora, and they meet the home's caretaker and a descendant of Meadowbrook's named Cattail. Upon learning of Fluttershy and Twilight's situation, Cattail grants them access to Meadowbrook's old medical journals.\n One of Meadowbrook's journals says that, after she perfected a cure for the sniffles, she was given her own healer's mask by her mother. One day, one of the villagers appeared on their doorstep with Swamp Fever. Using the flowers that spread the disease, Meadowbrook and her mother tried to make a cure but made little progress. Before long, the disease spread to the other villagers, including Meadowbrook's mother, leaving Meadowbrook to find a cure on her own.\nWhile observing the flowers in the swamp, Meadowbrook noticed a swarm of flash bees collecting nectar from them, immune to their poison. Reasoning that the bees' honey contains the cure for Swamp Fever, Meadowbrook follows the swarm to their hive and tries to collect some. However, the overly protective swarm attacks Meadowbrook with their electrified stingers, preventing her from reaching the honey. Therefore, she put on her healer's mask and came up with a plan.\n Meadowbrook eventually succeeded in retrieving the flash bees' honey and curing everyone in the village, though her journal doesn't say exactly how she accomplished it. In her final entries, she wrote that she would dedicate her life to curing ponies all over Equestria\u2014which, according to Cattail, she did up until her disappearance. With the information given by Meadowbrook's journal, Fluttershy decides to seek out the flash bee swarm and secure some of their honey for Zecora. However, Twilight and Cattail notice orange spots on Fluttershy's body, indicating she has also caught Swamp Fever. Fluttershy puts masks on Twilight and Cattail to keep them from getting infected and prepares to head to collect the honey. Twilight and Cattail urge her not to push herself and worsen her symptoms, but she is still determined to see her mission through and confident in her ability to reason with the bees.\nCattail leads Fluttershy to the flash bees' hive, and Fluttershy tries asking them for some of their honey, but they sting her in response. Fluttershy tries using the Stare on the bees, but they prove immune to it and sting her even more. After receiving the swarm's aggression, Fluttershy finally succumbs to her intense exhaustion and loses consciousness.\n When Fluttershy reawakens in Meadowbrook's house, Twilight and Cattail reveal that she has been unconscious for three days and that Zecora's condition has worsened to the point where leaves have started growing on her body. Fluttershy is distraught about wasting so much time, and Twilight and Cattail say they have already tried everything they could to reach the honey. Just then, a flash bee flies into the room and starts to nuzzle Meadowbrook's mask affectionately.Back at the flash bees' hive, Fluttershy explains that the stripes on Meadowbrook's mask resemble those of the queen bee, causing the male bees to become docile around it. Using the mask as a disguise, Fluttershy poses as the flash bees' queen and succeeds in taking some of their honey.\n Some time later, at Zecora's hut, a cured and fully-rested Fluttershy feeds the honey to Zecora, and she makes an instant recovery. Zecora thanks Fluttershy for the struggles she went through to cure her, but Fluttershy admits that she could've helped Zecora sooner if she listened to Twilight and didn't disregard her own health. Just then, Dr. Horse arrives with Swamp Fever symptoms and asks if Fluttershy found the cure.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode opens with the Cutie Mark Crusaders giving \"cutie mark counseling\" to a filly named Kettle Corn, who likes to paint circles. Unfortunately, it gets late in the day, and after wrapping up their session with Kettle Corn, the Crusaders have to turn away the foals lined up outside their clubhouse.\nUnable to work with blank flanks one at a time, the Crusaders decide to open a Cutie Mark Day Camp so they can help multiple blank flanks at once as well as foster teamwork among the foals themselves. Because they need a wide open area with a lot of activities for it, they decide to open their day camp at Camp Friendship, where Applejack and Coloratura used to go when they were little.\n As the Crusaders advertise their day camp in Ponyville, they see Rumble passing by and extend a flyer invitation for him to join. Rumble starts stomping on the flyer when his older brother Thunderlane appears. He flies off wanting to show Thunderlane a new flying trick he's been practicing, but Thunderlane notices the crumpled-up flyer and gets an idea. Some time later, the Crusaders open their camp to the blanks flanks of Ponyville, encouraging a variety of fun activities and fostering togetherness as they try out for their cutie marks. When Thunderlane arrives to drop off Rumble, the rest of the foals marvel at meeting one of the Wonderbolts, and Thunderlane briefly impresses them with his horseshoe-tossing and aerial skills before flying off to Wonderbolts practice.\nThroughout the day, Rumble shows little to no enthusiasm for the camp activities, from horseshoe-tossing to kayaking to archery to line-dancing to writing haikus. Not having any fun, he eventually flies off. In his absence, Kettle Corn gets her cutie mark in haiku-writing. Even though she isn't a blank flank anymore, she wants to come back to camp and keep painting circles, which Scootaloo happily encourages.\n The Crusaders are proud that their day camp is such a success, but they worry about Rumble and his lack of enthusiasm, figuring that he is feeling discouraged by a supposed failure at his activities. They find him at the Wonderbolts' practice stadium watching them perform. The Crusaders apologize for failing to find something that Rumble can excel in, and they promise to help him get his cutie mark.The Crusaders are shocked by Rumble's declaration and ask him why he doesn't want a cutie mark. Rumble explains that cutie marks force ponies to do only one thing for their entire lives, using the Crusaders themselves and their cutie mark counseling as an example. When the Crusaders fail to convince him otherwise, he flies off in frustration again. The Crusaders decide not to force Rumble and help the rest of the camp foals.\n On the Ponyville racetrack, Rumble practices his aerial diving when Thunderlane appears and breaks his concentration. Rumble expresses some frustration at being interrupted, and his brother apologizes, saying he's sure that Rumble will be a great flyer one day. When asked why he isn't at cutie mark camp, Rumble says he doesn't want to get a cutie mark in any of their activities. Regardless, Thunderlane says he's going back the next day, saying he \"can't be a blank flank forever\". His words gives Rumble an idea.\nThe next day, the Crusaders' day camp lets out after jam-making, though Pipsqueak is upset that he still doesn't have his cutie mark. As he expresses concern about getting a cutie mark in something he's good at or something he likes to do, Rumble bursts in spouting his ideology on how cutie marks limit ponies to doing just one thing. He suddenly breaks into song and slowly turns the rest of the campers over to his way of thinking, much to the Crusaders' dismay. At the end of the song, Rumble declares that he's opening his own camp on the other end of Camp Friendship where foals embrace being blank flanks.\n A short while later, the Crusaders watch from afar as Rumble's campers engage in activities that aren't very different from the activities they were doing before. They confront Rumble and argue that cutie marks make ponies special, but Rumble and the foals refuse to listen. They go back to doing camp activities, but when they start having fun and fear getting their cutie marks in those activities, they stop doing the activities altogether. As the Crusaders get even more annoyed with Rumble's stubbornness, the Wonderbolts fly over the camp, and Scootaloo thinks of someone who can reason with him. Back at the practice stadium, the Crusaders explain the situation to Thunderlane, who reveals that Rumble is actually good at all the camp's activities. Thunderlane explains that ever since he became a Wonderbolt, Rumble has watched him constantly and wanted to fly like him. Because he wants to be a Wonderbolt himself someday, he refuses to give anything else a chance. Apple Bloom realizes Rumble isn't afraid of doing just one thing\u2014he's afraid that one thing will prevent him from realizing his dream.\n Back at camp, Rumble and the other foals have become bored from not doing anything. Suddenly, the Crusaders return\u2014with special guest Thunderlane\u2014and invite the foals to do camp activities and play games with a member of the Wonderbolts. Little by little, the foals are convinced to return to the Crusaders' camp, leaving Rumble all by himself. Jealous of the fun his fellow blank flanks are having, Rumble eventually joins in. He sees Thunderlane making food, and Thunderlane says even though his cutie mark is about going fast, he really likes to cook.\n Finally convinced that ponies aren't limited by their cutie marks, Rumble joins his brother in making food. When the Crusaders invite him to run the camp obstacle course, Rumble says he'll do it tomorrow and that he's no longer worried about what kind of cutie mark he'll get.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins at the Castle of Friendship where Twilight Sparkle is filling out tall stacks of tedious paperwork.

Rainbow thanks Pinkie for the gesture and takes the pie inside the barracks with her, and Pinkie is satisfied by her friend's happiness.

When Sunburst arrives, Starlight looks forward to spending time with him and doing all the things they used to do together, like practice magic and play games. However, Sunburst also wants to do some antiquing, an activity that Starlight had no idea he was interested in.\nAt the antique store, Sunburst marvels at the various antiques and relics on display, but Starlight shows barely any interest. The two run into Twilight Sparkle, and she and Sunburst bond over their shared interest in antiquing, causing Starlight to feel left out. Sunburst notices her lack of enthusiasm and says she doesn't have to pretend to like antiquing, but Starlight appreciates how much he likes it himself, even as Twilight and Sunburst bond further at the Castle of Friendship.\n When Twilight and Sunburst notice how left out Starlight is feeling, they ask her what she wants to do, and Starlight takes out her and Sunburst's favorite board game from when they were little: Dragon Pit. After an afternoon of playing, Starlight helps Sunburst get settled in. She tries to discuss what they'll do together the next day, but all Sunburst can talk about is how well he and Twilight get along. The next day, Starlight wakes Sunburst up before the sun's barely even begun to rise. With Twilight busy with her princess duties, Starlight is excited to spend time with Sunburst alone. She takes him to see the apple trees at Sweet Apple Acres, and when Starlight demonstrates some applebucking, she drops some apples on Trixie's head. Trixie offers to show the two a new escape trick she's been working on, and Sunburst eagerly accepts. Unfortunately, the trick doesn't go well, prompting Sunburst and Starlight to assist.\n Being interested in stage magic himself, Sunburst unexpectedly bonds with Trixie as well and they share stage tricks with each other, causing Starlight to feel left out again. Later that day, Starlight takes Sunburst to see the magical Mirror Pool, and they run into Maud Pie, whose new cavern home is connected to the Mirror Pool's chamber. As Maud continues her geological studies, Sunburst joins her, having a moderate interest in geology as well. Once again, Starlight feels left out and leaves.\nSoon after, Twilight finds Starlight sulking by herself in the castle library. Starlight confides in Twilight that she and Sunburst had so much in common when they were little, but now she feels like he has more in common with her friends than he does with her. Twilight tells her that everyone changes over time and that they still have a common interest in magic, and this gives Starlight an idea.\n Some time later, Sunburst meets up with Starlight in the throne room, and Starlight shows him a new spell she invented. She uses her magic to turn the throne room into their old childhood home and revert themselves to the size of foals so they could relive their foal days of playing Dragon Pit together. Sunburst, uncomfortable with the lengths to which Starlight is going to spend time with him, angrily says he doesn't want to play, and Starlight undoes the effects of her spell. When Twilight enters to see what's going on, Starlight leaves the throne room in tears.\n Sunburst consults with Twilight on the situation and claims, even though he gets along well with Starlight's friends, he and Starlight still have plenty in common. Twilight advises Sunburst to remind Starlight of what those things are. To this end, he consults Trixie and Maud about what they have in common with Starlight. However, he learns that he doesn't have the same things in common with Starlight that they do, like Starlight and Trixie's troubled pasts and Starlight and Maud's shared feeling of being different from others.\nTwilight guides Starlight to the library, with Starlight feeling like she and Sunburst have grown so far apart that he doesn't want to be her friend anymore. Twilight proves her wrong by showing her what Sunburst, Trixie, and Maud put together in the library: a life-sized version of Dragon Pit. Starlight is touched by Sunburst's gesture and joins in.\n A few days later, Starlight, Twilight, Trixie, and Maud see Sunburst off at the train station when he leaves. Starlight and Sunburst agree that it doesn't matter what they have in common as long as they enjoy each other's company. As Sunburst leaves on the Friendship Express for the Crystal Empire, he looks through the mystery contents of a barrel he bought at the antique store. One of the items inside is an old, musty book with Star Swirl the Bearded's cutie mark on the cover.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins with narration by Star Swirl the Bearded explaining how he and five other ponies were brought together to maintain and spread the virtues of strength, bravery, healing, beauty, hope, and sorcery\u2014to serve as Equestria's \"pillars\". But when the pony who brought them together was believed to be covetous of the Pillars' power, they cast him out. The pony thus turned to darkness for power and revenge, and transformed into the Pony of Shadows. In order to stop the beast, the Pillars sacrificed themselves and left behind a seed that would eventually grow into the Tree of Harmony and protect Equestria in their absence.\n The story then cuts to the throne room at Canterlot Castle, where Sunburst finishes reading Star Swirl's last known journal entry in the book he acquired in the previous episode. Princess Celestia and Princess Luna are surprised to learn what became of their old teacher after he vanished, and Twilight Sparkle and her friends are shocked to learn that not only their favorite ponies of legend but also the Pony of Shadows are real. Curious about where the Pillars went after they defeated the Pony of Shadows, Twilight and Sunburst decide to apply their knowledge of ancient Equestrian history to decipher the rest of Star Swirl's writings.\n After three days of research and cross-referencing, Twilight and her friends have made little progress in deciphering Star Swirl's writings, largely due to their illegibility. Fortunately, Starlight Glimmer is able to make out the hard-to-read journal scrawlings, and the ponies learn that the Pillars of Old Equestria's final stand against the Pony of Shadows took place at the Temple of Ponhenge.\nThe ponies travel to the ancient temple of Ponhenge and find several rock formations with magical runes carved into them. When Twilight places Star Swirl's journal on one of the rock platforms, it activates an old holographic recording of Star Swirl, Rockhoof, Mistmane, Flash Magnus, Somnambula, and Mage Meadowbrook. In the recording, the Pillars of Old Equestria use talismans of the elements they each represent to seal away the Pony of Shadows, sacrificing themselves in the process.\n After deciphering more of Star Swirl's writings, Twilight learns that the Pillars of Old Equestria used a spell to trap the Pony of Shadows in limbo\u2014a space between worlds where time stands still. However, in order to imprison him for good, the Pillars had to trap themselves with him. With her knowledge of how Star Swirl's banishment spell works, Twilight believes she can set him and the other Pillars free.\nIn order to accomplish this, the Mane Six need to retrieve the magical artifacts and talismans that the Pillars used to imprison the Pony of Shadows: Rockhoof's shovel, Mistmane's everlasting flower, Flash Magnus' shield, Mage Meadowbrook's mask, and the blindfold Somnambula wore during the trial of the sphinx. The Cutie Map suddenly activates and shows the Mane Six where to find these items.\nApplejack retrieves Rockhoof's shovel from an archaeological dig at his old island home. Rarity retrieves Mistmane's flower from her old village and helps an elderly descendant of the village's residents restore her family garden. Rainbow Dash and Spike retrieve Flash Magnus' shield from the Dragon Lands when Garble is revealed to be using it as a surfboard. Fluttershy retrieves Meadowbrook's mask from Cattail in the Hayseed Swamp. Finally, Pinkie Pie retrieves Somnambula's blindfold from the pyramid outside the desert village with the help of Daring Do.\n Back at Ponhenge, Twilight, Starlight, and Sunburst make the last necessary preparations to cast Star Swirl's spell. Starlight expresses her misgivings about going through with the ritual, saying Star Swirl and the Pillars knew what they were doing and things should be left alone. Twilight and Sunburst argue, however, that saving the greatest ponies of legend from a thousand-year-old prison is too important to ignore.\nWhen the rest of the Mane Six return with the talismans, Twilight arranges them and Star Swirl's journal in a hexagonal pattern on the rock formations of Ponhenge. Twilight, Starlight, and Sunburst then use their magic to cast Star Swirl's spell, and the magic between the six talismans successfully releases the Pillars of Old Equestria from limbo. When Star Swirl the Bearded regains consciousness and Twilight\u2014starstruck at meeting her magical idol\u2014tells him what she and her friends have done, Star Swirl becomes instantly distressed.  He demands they undo what they've done and put them back, but Twilight says they can't.\n\nAs dark clouds gather in the sky, a black, amorphous creature comes into being, taking the form of a large horned pony with wings of smoke.

With Star Swirl still too weakened to challenge the beast, the Pony of Shadows attacks him, but Twilight Sparkle and Starlight Glimmer fend him off. Star Swirl vows to banish the Pony of Shadows again, but the Pony of Shadows is defiant. Also weakened from his thousand-year imprisonment, he escapes to regain his power.\nThe Pillars of Old Equestria are intent on stopping the Pony of Shadows before he gets all of his strength back. After hearing how accomplished the Mane Six are in dealing with threats such as Discord, Queen Chrysalis, and King Sombra, they decide to team up with them\u2014though Star Swirl is skeptical of their accomplishments and bitter toward Twilight for undoing his banishment spell.\n In order to locate the Pony of Shadows, the Mane Six take the Pillars to the Castle of Friendship, a byproduct of the Tree of Harmony that grew from the seed they planted long ago. Without the Temple of Ponhenge, they decide to use the Tree's magic to send the Pony of Shadows back to limbo, which would require sacrificing the Elements of Harmony. Twilight tries to dissuade Star Swirl from making such a sacrifice, but he is dismissive of her input.\nUsing the Cutie Map, the ponies seek out the darkest places in Equestria that the Pony of Shadows can draw power from. Meanwhile, Twilight looks for a solution in the castle library, feeling regret for unleashing a great evil upon Equestria just to meet her idol. She soon finds a portal spell that could banish the Pony of Shadows to limbo without sacrificing the Pillars. Starlight Glimmer suggests a solution that doesn't involve banishment, but Twilight is confident in Star Swirl's plan and wants to prove herself to him.\n Twilight's friends and the rest of the Pillars travel across Equestria in search of the Pony of Shadows, and the Pillars are surprised at how much Equestria has changed over the last thousand years. Later, back at the castle, the Pony of Shadows' possible whereabouts are narrowed down. When Twilight enters to share her idea of banishing the Pony of Shadows without sacrificing the Pillars, Star Swirl dismisses her again, but her friends stand up for her, and Star Swirl begrudgingly gives her idea some consideration.\n As the ponies wonder where the Pony of Shadows is hiding, the Mane Six's cutie marks suddenly start to glow, and the Cutie Map points them toward a remote, abandoned region of Equestria called the Hollow Shades. After finally giving Twilight some praise, Star Swirl leaves to prepare the new banishment spell while the others prepare for battle. Like before, Starlight Glimmer opts for a more peaceful solution than banishment, but Star Swirl refuses to consider it, saying \"Once a villain, always a villain.\"\nWith Star Swirl and Twilight refusing to listen, Starlight asks the other Pillars about the Pony of Shadows. Long ago, the beast was originally a unicorn named Stygian, who brought the Pillars together against the threat of the Sirens. As the Pillars were hailed as heroes, the ordinary Stygian became jealous of their abilities and stole artifacts from them for a spell. The Pillars cast him out as punishment for his actions. When Stygian later appeared before them again, he was consumed by darkness and revenge and became the Pony of Shadows. When asked what spell Stygian was trying to cast, the Pillars admit they don't know for sure, but they believe it was to steal their powers for himself.\n Starlight approaches Star Swirl and Twilight again, still curious about Stygian's true motives back then. When Star Swirl asserts that Stygian was driven purely by envy and that there is no return from the path he chose, Starlight argues that she herself is living proof of the contrary. She tries to convince Twilight that the map is calling her and her friends for a friendship problem, but Star Swirl maintains there is no way to befriend a pony like Stygian.\nIn the Everfree Forest, Star Swirl extracts the Elements of Harmony from the Tree of Harmony, calling them a necessary sacrifice to banish the Pony of Shadows. With the Elements still attuned to Twilight and her friends, the Mane Six and Pillars team up in pairs to use their magic.\n Upon reaching the Hollow Shades, the Mane Six and Pillars challenge the Pony of Shadows. They are suddenly dragged underground to the Well of Shade, where Stygian had originally become one with the darkness, and the Pony of Shadows appears before them. The beast bears contempt toward the Pillars for turning their backs on him, and Twilight starts to believe Starlight was right about this being a friendship problem. The ponies cast their spell and open a portal to limbo, and the Pony of Shadows starts getting dragged inside.\nBefore Twilight can complete the spell, she sees Stygian's true form sticking out of the Pony of Shadows' body, and she flies inside. At the depths of the darkness, Twilight finds Stygian despairing over his friends' betrayal. When Twilight claims he betrayed the other Pillars by trying to steal their power, Stygian argues that he only wanted the Pillars' respect. Wishing to help them in their battles, he took their artifacts so he could replicate them and become a Pillar as well; the Pillars hear this and realize how wrong they were. The darkness inside Stygian starts to consume him again, but Twilight offers to help him overcome it, and Starlight enters to support her.\n The Mane Six and Pillars of Old Equestria work together to free Stygian from the darkness, and the darkness is banished to limbo. Because the ponies used the Elements of Harmony for healing instead of banishment, the Elements remain intact. Star Swirl apologizes to Stygian for letting pride cloud his judgment and driving him away, and he thanks Twilight for helping him and his fellow Pillars see the error of their ways. The Mane Six's cutie marks glow again, indicating a successful friendship mission.\n Some time later, in Canterlot, Star Swirl reunites with his old pupils Princess Celestia and Princess Luna. The princesses ask Star Swirl to stay and teach magic again, but Star Swirl decides to travel and see how much Equestria has changed before settling down in one place. In addition, the other Pillars wish to see what has become of their old homes. Celestia hopes that the Pillars will return on occasion to share wisdom of their experiences, and Star Swirl points to Twilight in recognition of her own wisdom on the Magic of Friendship.\nAs the ponies and Pillars come together for a group hug, Twilight thanks Starlight for helping her look past her idol worship and see things clearly in the end.\n"}]}, {"season": "8", "eps": [{"summary": " The episode begins at the Castle of Friendship shortly after the events of My Little Pony The Movie.

Tempest Shadow, the former lieutenant of the Storm King, has left to travel Equestria and spread the word of his defeat. Realizing that there are so many creatures beyond Equestria who know nothing about friendship, Twilight decides to open a friendship school.\nAt the School for Gifted Unicorns, Twilight informs Princess Celestia of her plans, and Celestia gives her full approval and support. When Twilight bombards Celestia with questions on how to run the school properly, Celestia tells her that her time as Celestia's pupil has already more than prepared her. In addition, Celestia informs Twilight that her school plans must be approved by the Equestria Education Association\u2014or E.E.A.\u2014the leading authority on all school-related matters.\n When Twilight and Spike meet with the E.E.A.'s hard-nosed Chancellor Neighsay, Twilight assures him and his council that her friendship curriculum will make Equestria a safer place. Neighsay places an emphasis on teaching ponies rather than other creatures, but he and the council accept Twilight's plans and grant provisional approval for the opening of her school. Some time later, the School of Friendship is officially opened near Twilight's castle. To realize her goal of teaching friendship to others, Twilight has appointed her friends as teachers and Starlight Glimmer as a guidance counselor. Some of the ponies are unsure about their qualifications to be teachers, but Twilight is confident that everything will be fine as long as they follow the E.E.A.'s guidelines.\nThe school doors open, and Twilight's friends discover that she has invited not just ponies to be school students but also dragons, griffons, yaks, changelings, and Hippogriffs. As the students get settled in, several key characters start to interact with their new teachers as well as each other: an easygoing Earth pony named Sandbar, a sarcastic griffon named Gallus, a cheerful but clumsy yak named Yona, a gruff dragon named Smolder, a shy changeling named Ocellus, and a hyperactive Hippogriff named Silverstream.\n In her first address to the new students, Twilight welcomes them to the school and invites them to \"Friends and Family Day\" so that students' family members can see their education progress. In the song School of Friendship, both teachers and students are bright-eyed and hopeful for the classes to come. However, as days pass and Twilight forces her friends' lessons to be in accordance with the E.E.A.'s guidelines, the fun that the rest of the Mane Six and the students are having rapidly dwindles.\n As some of the students get bored and frustrated with their classes and teachers, they start to argue amongst themselves. Smolder challenges Yona's claims that yaks have the best of everything, and Gallus criticizes Sandbar's soft pony sensibilities. Rainbow Dash, Applejack, and Starlight Glimmer break up the argument and tell the students to get to class. With their students arguing around them instead of learning about friendship, the ponies wonder if they are cut out to be teachers.\nThe next day, in Twilight's office, the ponies complain to her about their lack of teaching progress. But Twilight assures them that, despite their rough start, they will be fine as long as they stick to the E.E.A.'s guidelines. Starlight suggests a teaching method not outlined by the E.E.A., but Twilight says Chancellor Neighsay will be visiting later for Friends and Family Day to make sure the guidelines are being followed.\n Frustrated with the boring lessons, Gallus and Smolder decide to ditch class to take a \"mental health break\". Sandbar, Silverstream, Yona, and Ocellus join them with the assurance that they will be back in time for Friends and Family Day. Before Fluttershy nearly catches them playing hooky, Ocellus disguises herself as Rarity and says she is taking the others on a field trip to the lake. Her quick-thinking is met by Smolder's approval. Later that day, Chancellor Neighsay arrives at the School of Friendship to check on Twilight's progress. Rainbow Dash informs Twilight and Starlight that her students are gone, but the three of them keep this a secret from Neighsay and distract him. Meanwhile, as Gallus, Silverstream, Smolder, Yona, Sandbar, and Ocellus spend time together at the lake, they start to get along better than earlier, and Ocellus impresses her new friends with her changeling transformations.\nAt the lake outside the school, ponies and various other creatures gather together for Friends and Family Day. Just as Twilight and Neighsay join them, the students return from ditching class, with Ocellus disguised as a giant insect-like monster. The event attendees erupt into a panic, and Neighsay believes the school is under attack. When the students inadvertently make a mess of Friends and Family Day, Neighsay perceives it as an act of aggression, and Twilight apologizes on behalf of her students.\n Neighsay is shocked to learn that Twilight has non-ponies among her students, calling the other races \"dangerous\" and believing they would use Twilight's lessons against Equestria. Thorax, Ember, Prince Rutherford, and Grampa Gruff take extreme offense to Neighsay's insinuations and pull the students they represent out of the school.

Starlight tells Twilight she gave up too easily and should stand up for what she believes in, regardless of what anyone says. Twilight is unsure about going against Chancellor Neighsay and the E.E.A.'s rules, but Starlight says, as the Princess of Friendship, she should write her own rules.\n Taking Starlight's words to heart, Twilight meets with the rest of her friends in the castle throne room and declares she is reopening the school.

Pinkie Pie is disappointed that Maud has had other plans for the past several days and they haven't spent much time together lately. Before Maud can explain the reason for this, Pinkie says they can still spend time together before Maud's upcoming birthday, and they make plans to hang out the following morning.\n However, when Pinkie goes to meet Maud at her cavern home the next morning, Maud is strangely not there.

At first, Pinkie is very excited that her sister is in a relationship, but when Maud introduces Pinkie to her boyfriend, it is revealed to be the annoying stallion she met in the bakery, named Mudbriar. Maud explains that the two of them met during a rock show, and Mudbriar is as passionate about sticks as Maud is about rocks.\n Though they have much in common and make each other smile, Pinkie still thinks Mudbriar's mannerisms and constantly pointing out technicalities are annoying and weird.

Pinkie takes offense to the notion that Mudbriar knows Maud better than she does and suggests asking her straight out.\nOn a hill where Starlight and Maud are flying kites, Pinkie and Mudbriar appear, and Pinkie asks Maud whether or not she likes surprise parties. Maud explains that, while she likes surprise parties because it makes Pinkie happy to throw them, she would prefer a smaller party with just Pinkie, Starlight, and Mudbriar. In disbelief over this revelation, Pinkie admits that Mudbriar is impossible to like and accuses Maud of choosing him over her.\n Maud insists that she didn't choose either of them over the other and says Mudbriar makes her happy, even adopting some of his mannerisms.

Unable to find a solution to her dilemma, she asks them why Maud would like Mudbriar and what he has that she doesn't.\nLimestone and Marble lead Pinkie over to what appears to be an ordinary rock. When Marble cracks it open, it's revealed to be a geode with sparkling blue gems inside. Limestone explains that Pinkie may see Mudbriar as a rock, but Maud sees him as a beautiful gem. Even if Pinkie can't see past Mudbriar's dullness, all that matters is how happy he makes Maud. Pinkie thanks her sisters for their insight.\n Back in Ponyville, Pinkie returns to help Mudbriar wrap a birthday present for Maud, and she extends an olive branch to him in truce and apology. Though Mudbriar points out that her gift is technically a quercus and not an olive branch, he accepts Pinkie's apology and friendship, and they team up again to plan Maud's party. At the end of the episode, ponies gather outside Town Hall for Maud's birthday, but the pony of honor is just a cardboard cutout. Meanwhile, the real Maud has a smaller party on a nearby hill with Pinkie and Mudbriar like she wanted. Maud is pleased with this outcome, and Pinkie gives Mudbriar all the credit for the idea.

The ponies try to talk to her, but she continues to act as her salespony characters toward them and dismisses her raccoon friends as unwanted rodents. When they try to tell her there's a better way to address the customers, she kicks them out of the boutique.\nAt the Canterlot Royal Fashion Show, Rarity and her designer assistants still struggle with the centerpiece dress of Rarity's new collection.

When Rarity sees the state the shop is in and Fluttershy's insensitive views toward its clientele, she fires Fluttershy three times\u2014once for each of her individual new personas. Finally dropping the act, Fluttershy apologizes for taking her salespony characters too far and for hurting her raccoon friends' feelings. She explains that acting like the ponies of Saddle Row gave her the confidence to interact with them.\nRarity tells Fluttershy that she wanted a friend to run her shop instead of someone like the rude ponies of Saddle Row and that she already had all the strength and confidence she needed to run it. This lesson gives Rarity the inspiration she needs to finish the centerpiece dress of her new collection.\n With Fluttershy as her model, Rarity debuts her \"Warrior of Inner Strength\" dress to the ponies of Manehattan, and it is met with great positive reception. Fluttershy feels sorry that Rarity had to leave the Canterlot fashion show early, but Rarity insists that making the perfect dress is more satisfying than showing it off. When a Saddle Row pony insinuates that Rarity's dress debut is an attempt to undercut the Canterlot fashion show, Fluttershy demonstrates her real inner strength by telling the pony off.\n"}, {"summary": " In the Wonderbolts locker room, Rainbow Dash overhears Soarin, Fleetfoot, and Misty Fly talking about a famous rollercoaster at Las Pegasus called the \"Wild Blue Yonder\", which all of the Wonderbolts have ridden except her. After hearing Soarin describe the ride, Rainbow Dash excitedly tells all of her friends in Ponyville about it. Unfortunately, the rollercoaster is scheduled to permanently close soon, and Rainbow is unable to go and ride it because of her classes at the School of Friendship.\nRainbow asks Applejack to cover her classes for her while she goes to Las Pegasus. Applejack agrees on the condition that Rainbow chaperone the \"Gold Horseshoe Gals\"\u2014Granny Smith, Auntie Applesauce, Apple Rose, and Goldie Delicious\u2014during their own annual Las Pegasus trip. Rainbow doesn't want to look after a group of slow, elderly ponies, but she agrees for the sake of riding the Wild Blue Yonder before it closes.\n As the Gold Horseshoe Gals board the Las Pegasus-bound hot-air balloon, Applejack gives Rainbow a list of rules to follow while chaperoning them, including making sure they don't overexert themselves and not letting them out of her sight. Rainbow wonders how she's going to ride the rollercoaster while following Applejack's rules, and Applejack tells her she'll find time and even learn how to have a good time from the elder mares. After a slow and boring balloon ride, Rainbow Dash and the Gold Horseshoe Gals arrive at Las Pegasus, where Rainbow is thrilled to discover the Wild Blue Yonder is inside the very hotel where they are staying. As they check into the hotel, the elderly ponies are eager to participate in some exciting hotel games and activities, but Rainbow Dash remembers Applejack's rules. Not wanting anything to jeopardize her chances of riding the rollercoaster, she encourages the others to get some rest in their hotel room.\nThe Gold Horseshoe Gals pretend to agree and retire to their beds. While the elderly ponies sleep, Rainbow tries to get a ticket to ride the Wild Blue Yonder, but the wait line is very long. With her chaperone responsibilities a priority, she begrudgingly gives her spot in line to someone else. However, when she checks in on the elderly ponies in the hotel room, she discovers they're gone.\n Rainbow Dash frantically searches the hotel for the missing old ponies, but she's unable to find them. But when she hears a crowd chanting Goldie Delicious' name, she finds them in the arcade playing a horseshoe-tossing game. The other hotel ponies are greatly impressed by their horseshoe skills, and even Rainbow Dash is impressed. However, she remembers Applejack's rule about not letting the old ponies get too excited, and she ends the game prematurely, much to everyone else's disappointment.\nGranny Smith suggests going to the hotel's buffet next. But when she picks up a plate of hard, crunchy nachos, Rainbow remembers Applejack's rule about only letting the old ponies eat soft food, and she gives them carrot soup instead, making them even more disappointed. Rainbow hears over the hotel's P.A. system that only one day remains before the Wild Blue Yonder is closed. She once again tries to get the Gold Horseshoe Gals to take it easy during their trip, but the old ponies refuse and want to go dancing instead.\n At DJ Pon-3's dance club, the Gold Horseshoe Gals bust a move on the dance floor, but Rainbow remembers Applejack's rule about not letting them overexert themselves. Their dancing draws the attention of two middle-aged stage magicians named Big Bucks and Jack Pot. They invite the gals to their magic show at the Pone Fantastique theater later that evening and give them complimentary VIP tickets to the event. Realizing their evening will drag on even longer, Rainbow Dash starts to lose hope that she'll ever get a chance to ride the Wild Blue Yonder.\n During Big Bucks and Jack Pot's magic show, they invite the Gold Horseshoe Gals onstage to be assistants in their signature magic trick. The trick involves the gals trying to escape from a tank filled with water. Rainbow Dash, fearing for the gals' safety, interrupts the magic trick and knocks the water tank over. Big Bucks and Jack Pot quickly leave the stage, and the Gold Horseshoe Gals chew Rainbow out for ruining their chance at performing with their favorite magicians.\n The gals finally voice their frustration at Rainbow Dash for interrupting or ruining every activity they wanted to do throughout their Las Pegasus trip. Rainbow Dash apologizes to the gals and admits she just wanted to ride the Wild Blue Yonder, but her responsibilities to them as enforced by Applejack got in the way.\nThe gals are annoyed by Applejack's over-worrying, and Rainbow fears she'll never get to ride the rollercoaster because of the long wait line. Luckily, the Gold Horseshoe Gals use their Las Pegasus VIP connections to skip to the front of the wait line, and Rainbow Dash is finally able to ride the Wild Blue Yonder, much to her delight.\n On the hot-air balloon ride back to Ponyville, Rainbow Dash admits that the elderly ponies are actually really cool. The old ponies return the sentiment and invite Rainbow to be an honorary member of the Gold Horseshoe Gals, which she happily accepts.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins with the Cutie Mark Crusaders excitedly bursting into Twilight Sparkle's throne room, having been summoned for their first friendship mission by the Cutie Map. The map calls the trio to Mount Aris, the home of the Hippogriffs. Twilight accompanies the three on their journey since she needs Silverstream's parents to sign a permission slip for her to go on a School of Friendship field trip.\nDuring the Friendship Express ride to the Mount Aris train station, Apple Bloom recalls what befell the Hippogriffs as told to her by Applejack. Long ago, the Hippogriffs once lived happily on Mount Aris but were forced to flee to the underwater realm of Seaquestria when the Storm King attacked their home, using Queen Novo's Pearl of Transformation to transform into seaponies.\n At Mount Aris, the Crusaders wonder what cutie mark-related problem they were summoned to solve, but Twilight points out that Hippogriffs don't have cutie marks. The Crusaders are unsure of where to start looking for their mission, but Twilight says they and whoever needs their help will find each other. Twilight and the Crusaders meet with Silverstream's brother Terramar, and the Crusaders are surprised to see him transform from a seapony to a Hippogriff. Terramar explains that, after the Storm King was defeated, some Hippogriffs came out of hiding and returned to live on Mount Aris while others remained as seaponies in Seaquestria. Queen Novo's Pearl of Transformation was then split into hundreds of fragments and distributed among her subjects so that they, including Terramar, could travel back and forth between the two realms.\nFollowing the Storm King's defeat, the Mount Aris capital city of Hippogriffia was restored to its former glory, and Twilight and the Crusaders arrive in the middle of a weekly celebratory festival. As Twilight goes off with Silverstream and Terramar's father Sky Beak, Terramar shows the Crusaders around, and Sweetie Belle becomes particularly enamored with an area called Harmonizing Heights. When the Crusaders marvel at how Terramar has two great places to live, he says he can't decide which one to stay in, and the Crusaders realize this is the problem they were summoned to solve.\n Terramar explains to the Crusaders that both Mount Aris and Seaquestria are great places to live, but he feels torn between the two because his father and sister live on land while his mother lives underwater. The Crusaders offer to help, listing the pros and cons of each place. Taken by the beauty and wonder of Harmonizing Heights, Sweetie Belle thinks Terramar should live on Mount Aris, but the others point out that they should visit Seaquestria before making such a decision. Twilight returns after getting Sky Beak's signature on Silverstream's permission slip, and they all go to Seaquestria together.\n On the shores of Mount Aris, Terramar uses his pearl fragment to transform himself, Twilight, and the Crusaders into seaponies. Scootaloo becomes fascinated with the weightless sensation of swimming underwater, imagining that it must be what flying feels like. Terramar leads the others to his mother Ocean Flow's house in Seaquestria. While Twilight speaks with Ocean Flow about Silverstream, Terramar once again gives the Crusaders a tour. Scootaloo is completely in love with the underwater realm, but Sweetie Belle is unimpressed, preferring Harmonizing Heights.\n Back on dry land, Twilight once again goes off with the Hippogriffs while the Crusaders help Terramar with his decision through song. Sweetie Belle sings about the beauty and serenity of Harmonizing Heights, and Scootaloo sings about the fun and excitement of Seaquestria. This drives an unexpected wedge between them, and Terramar ends up even more uncertain than ever. Because of their disagreement, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo refuse to talk to each other, leaving Apple Bloom stuck in the middle. When Twilight returns, the Crusaders explain what happened, and Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo admit their fault in Terramar's struggle. Twilight believes that Terramar is making his dilemma harder than it has to be by forcing himself to choose. When Sky Beak and Ocean Flow appear to invite Twilight to more activities, Twilight expresses that this must be how Terramar feels all the time. Seeing the Hippogriffs and seaponies come together, the Crusaders get an idea.\n On the outskirts of Mount Aris, the Crusaders find Terramar sulking by himself on a tree branch and apologize for making his decision even harder than before. They bring him to where the Hippogriffs and seaponies have come together for a picnic on the beach. Sky Beak and Ocean Flow apologize to Terramar for making him feel like he had to choose between his two homes and tell him he can keep going back and forth as he pleases. Terramar is overjoyed by this, and as he thanks the Crusaders for their help, their cutie marks glow to signify their completed friendship mission.\nWith their business at Mount Aris finished, the Crusaders invite Terramar to visit Ponyville someday, and he goes off happily with his parents.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins at Canterlot Castle, where Twilight Sparkle shares with Princess Celestia her idea for commemorating Celestia's \"ones-versary\"\u2014the one thousand, one hundred, and eleventh anniversary of when she first raised the sun. Twilight plans to put on a play at the School of Friendship, and Celestia is thrilled by the idea, having had a deep love for the theater ever since she was little.\nUpon learning that Celestia has never been in a play herself, Twilight offers her the leading role in her own play. Celestia and Spike are uncertain about Twilight's sudden casting decision, but Twilight says she is more than happy to do something nice for someone who has always put others before herself. Celestia is especially uncertain because she has no acting experience, but Twilight assures her she doesn't need experience since she will be playing as herself.\n Meanwhile, in Ponyville, the rest of Twilight's friends are busy preparing the stage for the play. When Twilight arrives and informs them that Celestia is now the leading actress, they have various reactions, from being overjoyed by the opportunity to spend casual quality time with her, to nervous at the same prospect, and Rainbow Dash flies off to tell everyone she knows. Twilight and Spike oversee rehearsals for the play, and Fluttershy serves as the narrator. However, when Princess Celestia steps onto the stage for her lines, she either speaks too softly, too loudly, or too awkwardly. Later, while practicing the play's dance number, Celestia dances out of sync with the other actors and accidentally drops them through a trapdoor.\nTwilight is unable to speak out against Celestia's poor acting out of fear of hurting her feelings, but she fears even more that Celestia will be humiliated in front of the audience.

Unfortunately, Rainbow Dash returns after already spreading the word and says everyone in Equestria will be attending. Despite Applejack's insistence, Twilight is determined to keep her promise to Celestia and let her be in the play.\n At the School of Friendship, Twilight introduces Celestia to On Stage and Raspberry Beret of the Method Mares, who have agreed to give Celestia acting lessons.

Instead, she has rewritten the script to give Celestia a more artistic role with no lines. Pinkie Pie produces a giant ball of magical fireworks she bought from Trixie to replace the sun prop, but when it goes off and shoots fireworks everywhere, much of the stage set becomes damaged.\nThis sends Twilight over the edge, and in her fit of anger, she finally voices her frustration about Celestia's terrible acting, unaware that Celestia is standing behind a curtain and hears the whole thing. Upset by Twilight lying to her this entire time, Celestia flies off. Twilight follows after her while her friends stall the waiting audience.\n In the sky over Equestria, Twilight tries to talk to Celestia, but she refuses to listen. Twilight admits that she wanted to do something to repay all the years that Celestia guided her as a teacher and friend, even at the risk of keeping the truth from her or disappointing her. Celestia tells her that the truth is always better than a well-intentioned lie, and she has an idea on how to save the play.As Spike's efforts to stall the crowd fail, Twilight and Celestia return. Stepping down from her leading role, Celestia tasks Twilight, Applejack, Pinkie, and Rarity with calming the crowd and Rainbow Dash with making a new stage backdrop. She also appoints Spike as the new narrator and Fluttershy as the new lead actress. The play goes on as planned, and Celestia uses the techniques she learned from the Method Mares to assist the acting ponies from off-stage.\n Despite some minor heckling from the audience, the play is ultimately met with very positive reception.

Upon arriving in Ponyville, Sunburst is pleasantly surprised to find that Starlight Glimmer has also been called by the Map. However, Starlight is less than enthused because the Map is calling them to Sire's Hollow\u2014their old hometown.\nDuring the Friendship Express ride to the village, Starlight expresses frustration that her father always treats her like a child whenever she visits. Sunburst is similarly frustrated by all the letters that his mother sends him, asking what his plans are for the future.

To that end, she announces a teamwork field trip\u2014which she feels is a job that a Teacher of the Month would be worthy of leading.\nApplejack and Rainbow Dash both volunteer for the task, believing their respective lifestyles and everyday jobs qualify them to lead a field trip. As they start to argue over which of them is more qualified to lead, Fluttershy suggests they lead the field trip together, and Twilight agrees. Rainbow Dash and Applejack agree that, although they have been competitive in the past, they will not let that get in the way of their students' education.\n Twilight, Applejack, and Rainbow Dash escort Silverstream, Sandbar, Gallus, Yona, Ocellus, and Smolder out into the field for their trip. Applejack and Rainbow have a brief disagreement over which of their planned activities to do first, but they try to maintain a shared position in leadership. As the class begins their first outdoor activity, Twilight leaves and says she'll check up on them later. Applejack leads the class in the teamwork-building exercise of constructing an apple shed. While she directs the class to work slowly and carefully, Rainbow Dash wants to work quickly so that they can get to the activity she has planned.

After even further lack of agreement between Rainbow and Applejack, they eventually decide to build a bridge across the ravine, resulting in yet another disagreement over what to build the bridge out of.

Neither bridge can support much weight, and one eventually collapses onto the other, causing Applejack and Rainbow to dangle helplessly over a stream of ravenous bite-acudas.\n Applejack and Rainbow Dash realize this entire situation is their fault because of their obsession with the Teacher of the Month award.

Discord is still dismissive of the notion of love, but Spike knows how he truly feels, considering all the time he spends at Fluttershy's tea parties.\n While Big Mac goes to mail the pie to Sugar Belle, Spike challenges that he can prove the splendor of love to Discord before the end of the day, and the loser has to mow Discord's lawn for eternity. Big Mac brings the pie to the post office to be delivered to Sugar Belle's village, but her name on the package gets smudged. As the Cutie Mark Crusaders decorate the barn for Big Mac's surprise dinner date with Sugar Belle, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo lament not having special ponies in their own lives.

Unfortunately, one of the main aspects of the \"molt effect\" is that the molting dragon will be kicked out of their home by their family. Because of what happened with Twilight earlier that morning, Spike fears he will end up being isolated and alone for the rest of his life, and Smolder also mentions the threat of predators such as rocs that will be drawn by his molt stench.\n Spike finally turns to Zecora for a solution, and though she can't interfere with a dragon's natural development, she suggests fixing his body odor and vocal shifts so that he doesn't have to isolate himself from ponies. Just then, Rarity arrives at Zecora's hut, causing Spike to hide from her. Rarity has recently developed hearing problems, which Zecora identifies as a side effect of prolonged exposure to phoenix feathers. Zecora gives Rarity some medicinal ear drops and keeps her distracted before she discovers Spike's presence.\n After Rarity leaves, Zecora finds Spike hiding under one of her masks outside the hut. However, he isn't hiding from Rarity\u2014he's hiding from a ravenous roc that was drawn to the smell of his molt. The roc chases Spike and Zecora through the Everfree Forest, and Spike offers to keep it distracted while Zecora goes to get help. However, the roc quickly snatches up Zecora, and when Spike runs into Rarity in the forest, the roc snatches them up as well. Spike manages to free himself from the roc's claws with his fire breath, but Rarity and Zecora remain trapped in its clutches.\n Spike's molt soon becomes so bad that he can't stop scratching himself. When Twilight appears, having planned to see Zecora about a remedy for Spike's stone scales, she discovers the danger that her friends are in. As Twilight flies up to attack the roc and save Rarity and Zecora, Spike's molt continues to progress. His uncontrollable itchiness subsides, but he suddenly gets encased in a stone-like cocoon. When the cocoon breaks, Spike emerges with a pair of dragon wings.\nWith his newfound ability to fly, Spike soars up to help Twilight save Rarity and Zecora from the roc. Spike distracts the roc and overwhelms it with fire, causing it to drop Rarity and Zecora, and Twilight and Spike swoop down to carry them to safety. While Twilight, Rarity, and Zecora are overjoyed by Spike's new wings, Spike is saddened that going through the molt means he'll have to leave his home as part of the \"molt effect\".\n Twilight doesn't want Spike to leave, saying they don't have to abide by typical dragon customs. She explains that growing up will not change who Spike is inside, and whatever happens in the future, they will get through it together. Spike joyfully hugs Twilight and takes his new wings out for a test drive. Some time later, Spike models Rarity's phoenix feather dress as she previously requested, and Rarity is excited that Spike's new flying ability makes him an even better fashion model than before."}, {"summary": " The episode begins with the Cutie Mark Crusaders sneaking around outside the School of Friendship classrooms. Bored with Miss Cheerilee's plain lessons at the Ponyville Schoolhouse, the fillies wish to take part in the more fun and exciting classes being taught by Twilight Sparkle and her friends, including cupcake sharing with Pinkie Pie, animal-frolicking with Fluttershy, and buckball with Applejack.\nDuring her lecture about Chancellor Puddinghead, Twilight notices Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo sitting amongst her students. She takes them into the hallway, where guidance counselor Starlight Glimmer briefly appears bored from having no students to counsel. Twilight refuses to let the Crusaders enroll at the School of Friendship because they already know all about friendship and regularly help ponies in need.\n Despite this, the Crusaders are determined to prove that they still have a lot to learn about friendship and deserve to be students at Twilight's school. To this end, Apple Bloom intentionally shirks her farm chores at Sweet Apple Acres, Sweetie Belle pesters Rarity with her constant begging at Carousel Boutique, and Scootaloo disguises herself as a student in Rainbow Dash's class. When these methods all fail, the Crusaders pretend to get into an argument in front of Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy, but this also fails when they accidentally stop pretending.\n Back at their clubhouse, the Crusaders discuss different ideas for trying to get into the School of Friendship. Just then, they hear crying outside and notice a young filly in tears sitting next to a nearby tree. When they approach and ask what's wrong, the filly introduces herself as Cozy Glow and explains she is having trouble with her School of Friendship lessons, having just recently moved to Ponyville. The Crusaders offer to help Cozy Glow with her schoolwork, believing that doing so would be just as good as being in Twilight and her friends' classes.\nCozy Glow's homework assignment is to do something nice for three ponies around town. With the Crusaders' assistance, she helps Bon Bon protect her face from the spines of a cactus she just purchased, gives color-coded sprinkle shakers to Mrs. Cake, and does Big McIntosh's chores for him so that he can spend time with Sugar Belle. Some time later, Cozy Glow meets the Crusaders outside the Ponyville Schoolhouse and excitedly announces that she got an \"A\" on her homework. Happy for Cozy Glow, the Crusaders wish to do more for her, and she mentions that she has a big friendship test at the end of the week. She asks the Crusaders for help studying, and the Crusaders eagerly agree.\n Over the course of the next several days, the Crusaders teach Cozy Glow about the values of friendship such as generosity, laughter, kindness, honesty, and loyalty by painting the Apple family barn, helping Fluttershy feed her animals, and retrieving Pipsqueak's kite. When classes are dismissed at the end of the week, however, Cozy Glow tearfully reveals to the Crusaders that she failed the test, and Twilight angrily calls the Crusaders to her office. In Twilight's office, Twilight scolds the Crusaders\u2014who Cozy Glow said were her tutors\u2014for teaching her the wrong things about friendship and intentionally making her fail. The Crusaders insist they were teaching Cozy Glow all the right things, but Twilight shows them Cozy Glow's test paper with nothing but incorrect answers. Because of what she perceives as the Crusaders' cruel and spiteful prank, Twilight bans them from her school and from having any further communication with its students. As the Crusaders leave, Cozy Glow watches from afar in shock and regret.\n Cozy Glow goes to Starlight Glimmer in her office for advice. She reveals that she failed her test on purpose so that Twilight would see that the Crusaders are bad at friendship and allow them to attend the school. Starlight says that, despite Cozy Glow's actions, her intentions were pure, and she also mentions that the Crusaders would make better teachers than students. When Cozy Glow asks if there is a place for the Crusaders at the school after all, Starlight gets an idea.At the Ponyville Schoolhouse, the Crusaders and their classmates spend the day cleaning the classroom. As the Crusaders wonder how Cozy Glow failed her test and why Twilight blamed them for it, Starlight Glimmer suddenly enters and asks Cheerilee if she can pull them away from cleaning for something else.\n The Crusaders are once again called into Twilight's office at the School of Friendship, where the rest of the Mane Six also appear. The fillies fear even more scolding and punishment, but Twilight says they were summoned for a different reason. Cozy Glow admits to what she did and apologizes to the Crusaders for getting them in trouble. Because the Crusaders succeeded in teaching Cozy Glow about the values of friendship, Twilight and her friends give them honorary diplomas and declare them official School of Friendship graduates.\nAs the Crusaders celebrate their own \"graduation\", Starlight Glimmer offers them positions at the school as friendship tutors, which they happily accept. As Twilight commends Starlight on her guidance counseling, the Crusaders leave to tutor more students in friendship, with Cozy Glow following close behind.\n"}, {"summary": " At the School of Friendship, Twilight Sparkle and her friends are awaiting the arrival of a photographer pony from the Canterlot Historical Society. When the photographer finally arrives, she apologizes for being late and takes each of the Mane Six's photographs\u2014while also taking a strand of hair from each of their manes. When Pinkie Pie points out that the photographer didn't take Starlight Glimmer's photograph, she quickly and halfheartedly takes one and leaves.\nWhen the photographer reaches the edge of the Everfree Forest, she puts on a wicked grin and drops her disguise, revealing herself to be Queen Chrysalis.\n Chrysalis attaches each of the Mane Six's photos and strands of hair to a tree in the forest and carves their cutie marks into the tree trunks. Using their likenesses and DNA, she creates artificial copies that can wield the Elements of Harmony and serve under her so that she can build a new hive and rule as queen again. She also intends to torture and destroy Starlight Glimmer as revenge for taking her old hive away from her.\nMeanwhile, Twilight and her friends are heading to a friendship camping retreat in the forest, having not had much time to hang out lately because of their classes. Applejack is particularly excited to have Starlight along for her first camping trip, and the campsite is near the Tree of Harmony.\n Back in the forest's depths, Chrysalis attempts to command her artificially-made slaves, but they refuse to obey and behave like polar opposites to their real counterparts: Mean Pinkie is irritable, Mean Fluttershy is a bully, Mean Rarity is greedy, Mean Applejack is a compulsive liar, and Mean Rainbow Dash is faithless. Mean Twilight openly questions Chrysalis' tactics, asking why she didn't simply attack the Mane Six instead of taking their hairs. Chrysalis argues that she no longer has her changeling hive and needs the Elements of Harmony to stand a fighting chance.\n As Twilight and her friends continue toward the campsite, Fluttershy goes off by herself to help a little bird that got separated from its sibling, and Pinkie Pie ventures on ahead of the others. Meanwhile, Chrysalis continues to deal with her artificial servants' overall disobedience as they search for the Elements of Harmony. When they also get separated, Mean Twilight suggests splitting up to cover more ground, which Chrysalis allows.\nAs Mean Twilight goes off by herself to search for Mean Fluttershy and Mean Rainbow, she starts to consider betraying Chrysalis so that she and the other copies can keep the power of the Elements for themselves. She runs into the real Pinkie Pie and learns from her the location of the Elements of Harmony. Elsewhere, Fluttershy returns the little bird to its nest and briefly encounters Mean Rainbow. As the rest of the Mane Six look for Fluttershy, they agree to split up the search and meet up later at the Tree of Harmony.\n Mean Fluttershy terrorizes the animals of the forest, causing them to growl at the real Fluttershy when she comes by. Meanwhile, Applejack and Rainbow Dash run into Mean Rarity, who suddenly and greedily hoards all of Applejack's camping supplies for herself. When Mean Applejack encounters the real Rarity and Starlight Glimmer, she remembers that Chrysalis is seeking revenge against Starlight and decides to lead them back to the queen. Finally, Twilight briefly encounters Mean Pinkie and Mean Rainbow.\nWith the Mane Six and their artificial counterparts spread out across the forest, it leads to further confusion and mistaken identities as the real ponies get blamed for things that the fake ponies say and do. One such misunderstanding causes Twilight to get into a heated argument with Pinkie Pie. As Mean Twilight goes off on her own, she regroups with Queen Chrysalis and reveals she knows where the Elements of Harmony are.\n When Mean Rarity believes Applejack and Rainbow Dash to be plotting to steal her belongings, she crazily runs off on her own. Meanwhile, Mean Applejack tells fake camping stories to Rarity and Starlight Glimmer, and she ends up hurting Starlight's feelings, causing Starlight to run off. As Rarity goes after Starlight, Chrysalis and the rest of the copies regroup with Mean Applejack. With her artificial minions gathered together again, Chrysalis heads toward the Tree of Harmony.\n Rarity's chase after Starlight leads them to Twilight, Pinkie, and Fluttershy, and Applejack and Rainbow Dash appear as well. Because of their fake counterparts' actions, the seven ponies argue bitterly with each other. Twilight interrupts the arguing, admits to getting carried away with her planning, and says she'll understand if they want to forget about the retreat and return home. The others exchange apologies for all the misunderstandings and harsh words, and they decide to press on toward the campsite.\n Chrysalis and the Mean 6 reach the campsite first, and the Mean 6 demolish it. Chrysalis, utterly exhausted by her minions' insubordination and antics, commands them to retrieve the Elements from the Tree of Harmony. Unbeknownst to Chrysalis, Mean Twilight and the others plan to turn against her once the Elements are in their possession.\nAt the base of the Tree of Harmony, Chrysalis discovers her creations' true motives and attacks them, all while the Elements react to the Mean 6's presence. Just before Mean Twilight overpowers Chrysalis, the Tree of Harmony grabs the Mean 6 with tendrils of light and liquefies their bodies, reducing them to the clumps of wood they were originally. With her plans ruined, Chrysalis once again swears vengeance on Starlight Glimmer.\n When the real Mane Six and Starlight arrive to find the campsite in ruins, Twilight is discouraged at first, but they all share a laugh over what a complete disaster their friendship retreat was. As they fix up the campsite together, Queen Chrysalis flies off into the night sky.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Twilight Sparkle showing her students at the School of Friendship a collection of valuable artifacts and treasures that were donated to the school from other cultures. She explains that the students are going to learn about the artifacts during a \"Spell-venger Hunt\"\u2014a magical scavenger hunt\u2014that she has organized, the winner of which will win a tour of the Canterlot Archives with Princess Celestia.\nHowever, before Twilight can pick the teams for the Spell-venger Hunt, her cutie mark starts to glow, indicating that she is being called by the Cutie Map for a friendship mission. She goes to the Castle of Friendship throne room and discovers all of her friends have been called by the map as well\u2014and to a very distant location. With all of the school's teachers being called away, Twilight tasks Starlight Glimmer with acting as the interim headmare in their absence. Starlight is unsure about being given such a large responsibility, but Twilight has faith in her leadership skills, and she leaves Starlight with her meticulous curriculum plans and Spike to assist her.\n As soon as Starlight and Spike bid the Mane Six farewell on their mission, Discord appears, assuming that he is in charge of running the school while they are gone. When Starlight and Spike point out that Starlight is in charge instead, Discord attempts to enforce some of his own rules in addition to Twilight's, but Starlight stops him and insists on running the school in accordance with Twilight's guidelines.\n On her first day as temporary headmare, Starlight finds that Discord arrived before her and chaotically redecorated her office, prepared to take over in Starlight's place. Starlight declines Discord's help, but Discord has already hired several substitute teachers to fill in for the Mane Six's classes: Iron Will, Cranky Doodle Donkey, and a dragonsneeze tree. Unfortunately, Discord's choices for substitute teachers prove utterly ineffective at teaching friendship.\nAs Discord aggravates Starlight on her inability to run a school, Starlight tells him to leave before his \"assistance\" causes any more trouble. Discord leaves, but Spike warns Starlight that Discord is merely testing Starlight and will likely not back off, even when commanded to. Nevertheless, Starlight resolves to run the School of Friendship properly and keep her promise to Twilight.\n The next day, Starlight brings in a new group of substitute teachers to help her teach classes\u2014Trixie, Spitfire, and Maud Pie\u2014and reminds the students about the Spell-venger Hunt scheduled for later that day. As Trixie teaches the school students about the friendship element of magic, Discord\u2014pretending to be a student himself\u2014interrupts the lesson with rude phone calls and sabotages Trixie's magic act by causing her to pull an ursa major out of her hat.\nDiscord causes a similar disruption by summoning a bugbear to chase the students during P.E. When Yona nearly gets hurt during Discord's lesson, Starlight Glimmer intervenes and angrily scolds him for endangering students and trying to sabotage her headmare duties. However, Discord continues to antagonize Starlight and openly questions her capabilities, and in a fit of frustration, Starlight magically banishes him from the school grounds. Starlight begins to question her own abilities as headmare and wonders why her being in charge upsets Discord so much.\n Later that day, the Spell-venger Hunt begins, and Starlight explains the game's rules and splits the students up into teams of two. As the students split up to locate the cultural artifacts and treasures hidden around the school, Starlight and Spike go to the observatory to watch from above. Ocellus and Smolder find the Helm of Yksler mounted on a pony suit of armor, but the armor suddenly comes to life and attacks them.\nElsewhere, Gallus and Silverstream find the Crown of King Grover behind a painting in the library, but all of the paintings come to life and attack the students as well. As she watches this, Starlight quickly deduces Discord to be the cause, explaining to Spike that she only banished Discord's physical form from the school and that Discord is still able to cause trouble in ghost form. Spike wonders how they are going to stop Discord if magic failed to stop him, and Starlight says she isn't going to use magic this time.\n As Discord menaces more students with his ghostly mischief, the school erupts into chaos as the students start to believe it is haunted. When Starlight and Spike arrive and reveal Discord to be causing trouble again, Discord appears with all of the artifacts from the Spell-venger Hunt. When he refuses to stop causing trouble for Starlight, Starlight unbanishes his physical form from the school. Thinking as a guidance counselor instead of a headmare, she apologizes for making him feel left out of the school activities and offers him the position of vice headmare, which he eagerly accepts. With peace made between the two, Discord helps set everything back up for the Spell-venger Hunt.\n The Mane Six return from their trip and reveal that Discord cast a spell on their cutie marks that sent them on a fake friendship mission. Twilight thanks Starlight for looking after the school while they were gone, and Discord is disappointed that he's no longer the vice headmare.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins during Hearth's Warming time at the School of Friendship; while some students are excited to celebrate the holidays with their friends and families, others are more excited for the time off from classes. Twilight Sparkle points out that Hearth's Warming is also a time to remember when Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns first came together during the founding of Equestria, as symbolized by the Fire of Friendship burning at the top of the Hearth's Warming tree.\nTwilight officially dismisses the students for winter vacation and tells the Young Six to pack up so they can travel home for the holidays. As Spike wonders what his Hearth's Warming presents are, a cloaked figure sneaks onto the rafters and pours magical powder onto the Hearth's Warming tree, causing the Fire of Friendship to fizzle out and the Hearth's Warming decorations to be covered in purple, glue-like slime. Twilight, Rainbow Dash, and Spike spot the cloaked figure as they make their getaway, and as they give chase, they notice the culprit retreat into the student dorms.\n Inside the dorms, the Young Six come out of their rooms while packing for winter break and ask what's going on. Twilight, Rainbow, and Spike show them the mess that the cloaked figure made in the school lounge and reason that one of the Young Six did it because there's no other exit out of the student dorms. The students all plead innocence, and despite Twilight giving the culprit a chance to be honest and take responsibility, no one steps forward. Therefore, Twilight makes all of the students clean up the mess while she and Rainbow Dash interrogate them one-by-one, with the guilty party being forced to stay at the school during winter break for extra friendship lessons. She adds that if no one confesses, then all of the students will have to stay at school for winter break.\n While Gallus is called into Twilight's office first, Smolder tries to get one of the other four students to confess to pulling the prank, but each insists it wasn't them. Ocellus is particularly insistent because she has loved Hearth's Warming ever since it was introduced to the Changeling Kingdom one year prior. She tells her friends a story about how she and her fellow changelings started celebrating the holiday and adopted its various traditions, albeit a little bizarrely and literally than other creatures.\nTwilight and Rainbow Dash call Ocellus into the office next, and Gallus also claims to be innocent of pulling the prank. As Yona gets increasingly frustrated over not being able to celebrate the holidays with her fellow yaks, she explains that the yaks celebrate a different holiday called \"Snilldar Fest\", which the yaks celebrate by gathering a large pile of objects and spend an entire day smashing them. She then tells her friends a story about her and her family celebrating Snilldar the previous year.\n Ocellus soon returns, and Sandbar is called into Twilight's office next. When asked about her own holiday traditions, Smolder explains that the dragons celebrate the \"Feast of Fire\", in which the dragons come together to tell stories and the dragon who tells the best story wins a pile of gems. The most recent winning story was about a homeless dragon named Scales that was invited to the Dragon Lands by the then-Dragon Lord for a great feast. During the feast, Scales took advantage of the Dragon Lord's moment of defenselessness to seize power and claim control of the Dragon Lands for herself.\nSandbar returns, and Silverstream is called into Twilight's office next. Smolder and Yona tell Sandbar to take the blame for the prank since he already lives in Ponyville, but Sandbar refuses and would rather spend the holidays with his family. He then tells a story about a previous Hearth's Warming where his crocheted doll nearly fell into the fireplace. Finally, both Smolder and Yona are called into the office, and the rest of the students fear being unable to go home for the holidays if none of them confesses soon.\n As the students lament their situation, Silverstream laments having to miss out on her own Mount Aris/Seaquestria tradition, the \"Three Days of Freedom Celebration\". As part of the celebration, the seaponies/Hippogriffs spend the first night in Seaquestria thanking the ocean for protecting them from the Storm King, the second day on Mount Aris celebrating the Storm King's defeat, and the third day partying with family members on land and sea and receiving gifts from Queen Novo. Gallus is so unfamiliar with the concept of family that he doesn't know what \"cousins\" are.\nSmolder and Yona return to the lounge, and since no one confessed to the prank, they all fear being stuck at school for the holidays. Silverstream and Ocellus start to cry about not being able to see their families, and the others begin turning on one another, with Silverstream suggesting the possibility of there being more than one culprit. As a loud argument breaks out among them, Gallus breaks it up and remarks how lucky his friends are to have loved ones to spend the holidays with and share stories with.\n Gallus explains that Griffonstone's \"Blue Moon Festival\" is the only time of year when griffons aren't mean to each other. When Silverstream says Gallus at least gets to spend it with his family, he reveals that he doesn't have a family and never felt like he had a place in Griffonstone. He also admits that he's the one who pulled the prank because he doesn't want to go home for winter break and wanted to stay with his friends for a little longer. He states that he's only confessing now so that his friends would stop fighting and be allowed to go home to be with their families.\n Before Gallus can confess what he did to his teachers, Twilight, Rainbow Dash, and Spike appear, having heard the whole thing from outside the room. While Twilight commends Gallus for his honesty, she states that he still has to take responsibility for his actions, which means staying at school during winter break for extra friendship lessons. Silverstream, Ocellus, Yona, Sandbar, and Smolder offer to stay with Gallus at the school so that he won't be lonely.\nRealizing that their students don't need extra lessons after all, Twilight and Rainbow invite the Young Six to a holiday dinner with the rest of the Mane Six, and the students happily accept.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Star Swirl the Bearded sending a postcard to Twilight Sparkle during his journey across Equestria. After Twilight taught him about the values of friendship, Star Swirl has spent much of his journey helping other ponies and engaging in friendly relationships.\nAt the School of Friendship, after reading Star Swirl's postcard, Twilight expresses to Rarity that if Star Swirl truly wants to learn about friendship, he could enroll at her school. Cozy Glow enters Twilight's office with a mail delivery: a large stack of crates with sewing machines that Rarity plans to use for her friendship classes, and a stack of flyers. When Twilight looks at the flyers, she is shocked to discover that there is another School of Friendship located in Las Pegasus.\n As news about Friendship University circulates around the school, particularly its promise of teaching friendship in half the time as Twilight's school, Twilight and Rarity decide to investigate. Upon arriving in Las Pegasus, they find that Friendship University doesn't look like a typical educational institution and that it is run by the Flim Flam brothers.\nThrough their signature style of song, Flim and Flam advertise that their university can teach ponies about friendship in half the time as the School of Friendship and use Twilight's presence in the audience as proof of its legitimacy. When they also mention that the school is about to be officially accredited, Chancellor Neighsay of the E.E.A. appears, much more accepting of Flim and Flam's school than Twilight's due to its pony-only environment.\n When Twilight casts suspicion on Flim and Flam's teaching skills because of their past actions, Neighsay accuses her of trying to undermine the competition and monopolize friendship lessons. As Flam oversees student enrollments, Flim and Neighsay give Twilight and Rarity a tour of the university. When Twilight continues to doubt Flim and Flam's true motives, Flim tries to convince her otherwise by revealing that Star Swirl the Bearded is enrolled at the university.\nUpon seeing Star Swirl enrolled as a student, Neighsay is fully convinced and gives Flim and Flam's school full E.E.A. accreditation. Twilight is heartbroken that her idol would enroll at Flim and Flam's friendship school instead of hers, but Star Swirl states he is simply following what Twilight taught him about friendship and giving the Flim Flam brothers a chance to change their ways, especially since they don't even charge money for classes. However, Twilight still firmly believes that Flim and Flam are up to something.\n In order to find out what Flim and Flam are truly up to, Rarity employs her investigative skills and knowledge of Shadow Spade novels to disguise herself and Twilight as university students\u2014though Twilight's disguise consists only of an eye patch and a sticky note over her cutie mark. Twilight tells Rarity to enroll in some classes and find out what Flim and Flam are teaching while she looks around the rest of the school.\nIn Flam's class, Rarity\u2014going by the alias \"Plainity\"\u2014discovers that fundamentals of friendship such as generosity are part of the lessons, and when she expertly demonstrates generosity for the class, Flam chooses her to be his star pupil. Meanwhile, Twilight sneaks into Flim and Flam's office to dig up dirt on the brothers. However, all she finds are lesson plans that are true to the core values of friendship, and she is unable to find any proof that Flim and Flam are scamming ponies.\n All of a sudden, Flim and Flam appear and catch Twilight in the act of trying to undermine their university, and they take a photograph of her doing so. Flim and Flam tell Twilight to stop investigating their school, or else they will leak the photograph to the press, destroy Twilight's reputation, and ensure that no one else enrolls at the School of Friendship. When Star Swirl appears with a completed stack of worksheets for Flim and Flam, he discovers what Twilight is doing and expresses his utter disappointment in her. Backed into a corner by Flim and Flam's blackmail, Twilight begrudgingly agrees to their terms.\n Rarity garners a considerable amount of popularity with the other university students in her \"Plainity\" persona. When Twilight regroups with her, she explains what happened in Flim and Flam's office and admits that she is a little jealous that Star Swirl enrolled at their school instead of hers. As she considers the possibility that Flim and Flam really have turned over a new leaf, Rarity decides to return the sewing machines she purchased so she can buy more worksheets from Flim and Flam. Twilight realizes that while Flim and Flam don't charge money for ponies to enroll at their school, they charge exorbitantly for the student worksheets.\nAfter watching Flim and Flam charge a student all the bits he has for their lesson worksheets, Twilight decides to risk her reputation for the sake of exposing the brothers' scam. She follows Flim and Flam to their office and sees them enter a secret room, where they funnel the money they got from their students into the expansion of their Las Pegasus resort. Twilight enters and exposes the brothers' true plans. Caught in their deception, Flim and Flam try to make a deal with Twilight\u2014she keeps their plans secret, and they don't leak her incriminating photo to the press. Twilight refuses, saying her reputation isn't worth it if ponies are being taken advantage of.\n Pressed about their lesson plans, Flim and Flam reveal that they simply copied from Twilight's School of Friendship guidelines. When Twilight suggests returning the money to the students and teaching friendship lessons for real, Flim and Flam refuse and state they almost have enough money to realize their goal. However, Rarity and Star Swirl suddenly enter, and having overheard everything Flim and Flam just confessed, Star Swirl demands that they refund the students' money and close Friendship University.\n As Flim and Flam return the money they collected from the university students, Star Swirl commends Twilight for once again being an upstanding example in friendship, including risking her reputation in order to stand up for what she believes in. When the students wonder how they are going to learn about friendship now, Star Swirl recommends that they enroll at Twilight's School of Friendship in Ponyville.\nSome time later, back at the school, Twilight reads another postcard from Star Swirl, who promises that if he ever decides to go back to school, Twilight's school will be his first choice. As Rarity wonders how Flim and Flam got a copy of Twilight's school guidelines in the first place, Cozy Glow enters and double-checks with Rarity about keeping the sewing machines she purchased. Rarity confirms, having learned from her experiences at Friendship University not to give up when standing up for one's beliefs.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins at the School of Friendship, with Rarity in a hurry to meet up with Rainbow Dash for their day out together. Starlight Glimmer stops her and asks her to serve as a brief example in Twilight Sparkle's school lesson. Eager to be an example for the school students, Rarity agrees and goes to Twilight's classroom, where she discovers that Rainbow Dash had been called upon for the same reason she was.\nTwilight, teaching the students about compromise in friendship, explains that Rarity and Rainbow Dash perfectly exemplify compromise by finding time to spend together even though they have different interests and jobs. However, when asked how they are going to spend their day together, the two are unable to agree on an activity, with Rarity wanting to go shopping and Rainbow Dash wanting to play buckball. Gallus questions further how the two can be friends if they have nothing in common.\n Rainbow and Rarity cite the mutual friends they share and the times Rainbow saved Rarity's life during the Best Young Flyer Competition and Rarity proved Rainbow's innocence of a crime she didn't commit, but they are unable to think of anything else. Starlight Glimmer states that friendships sometimes cannot be explained and must be seen in action. Rainbow Dash and Rarity proceed with their day out together, and Twilight and her students observe them from the side to watch their friendship in action. The two start out by playing a game of buckball against Braeburn's Appleloosa team. However, Rarity is too preoccupied with designing a line of buckball-themed leisure wear to focus on the game, much to Rainbow's frustration. Afterward, the two go shopping at a clothing store, but Rainbow gets annoyed by all the glittery stuff on display and incredibly bored when Rarity takes so long picking what boots to purchase.\nLater, Rainbow Dash and Rarity go gem-collecting in a cave, and they finally start to have fun together at first. But while Rarity is more concerned with collecting gems for a new piece of clothing she's working on, Rainbow is more concerned with finding hidden treasure. While trying to open what she believes to be a secret chamber, Rainbow accidentally knocks over Rarity's wagon, causing all the gems she collected so far to shatter into pieces.\n Rainbow and Rarity's frustration with each other grows even more, with Rainbow accusing Rarity of not caring about anything she likes and vice-versa. Twilight assures the observing students that this is merely a disagreement that even close friends have from time to time, but Rarity and Rainbow are so upset about not liking the same things that they declare their day together\u2014and their friendship\u2014over. Rainbow Dash and Rarity sit with Starlight Glimmer in her guidance counselor's office and air their multiple grievances about each other. Tired of their constant complaining, Starlight suggests they put themselves in each other's shoes. In the school library, Starlight mentions that since Rainbow likes the Daring Do book series and Rarity likes Shadow Spade, they should read each other's favorite book in order to reconnect as friends, and Rarity and Rainbow begrudgingly agree.\nWhen Starlight, Rarity, and Rainbow meet up again later to discuss the books they read, Rarity questions the over-the-top action sequences and ridiculous character names in Daring Do, and Rainbow critiques the overly detailed and boring clothing descriptions in Shadow Spade. When Rarity mentions certain plot twists in Shadow Spade, Rainbow reveals that she never actually read the book. As their arguing gets even worse, Starlight decides to bring in reinforcements to help resolve the matter.\n As Rarity and Rainbow Dash's arguing draws attention from nearby ponies, Starlight returns and alerts them to a problem back at the school. In Twilight's office, Twilight searches frantically for something. When Starlight arrives with Rarity and Rainbow, she explains that the Amulet of Aurora, one of the magical artifacts that Princess Celestia gave to the school, has gone missing. She explains further that the amulet can control water tides and summon tsunamis and that they must find it before it falls into the wrong hands.\nWith Rainbow Dash's expertise in treasure-hunting and Rarity's knowledge of mystery-solving, Twilight is confident that they can get the amulet back by working together while she and Starlight work on a locator spell. In their inspection of Twilight's office, Rarity finds that the other artifacts are present and untouched, and Rainbow discovers a trail of glitter that leads out of the school and into the nearby woods.\n Rainbow recognizes the glitter as Azurantium residue, the same metal from one of the Daring Do books, and a clueless Rarity reveals she didn't read Rainbow's book just as Rainbow didn't read hers. Angered that Rarity gave her a hard time earlier for not reading Shadow Spade, Rainbow Dash declares that she is never speaking to her again after they recover the Amulet of Aurora. As Rainbow Dash and Rarity follow the trail of Azurantium through the woods, Rarity discovers claw prints in the dirt, and Rainbow sees the Azurantium trail lead over a bubbling swamp. With the swamp too deep for Rarity to wade through and the steam geysers too hot for Rainbow to fly over, Rarity constructs a raft out of tree bark and vines. Rainbow is surprised and impressed by Rarity's ingenuity and resourcefulness, and she uses her wings to propel the raft forward, carrying herself and Rarity safely over the swamp.\nAt the other end of the swamp, Rainbow and Rarity lose the trail of Azurantium, and they encounter a Bufogren, a large, frog-like creature with six eyes, overly sensitive ears, a soft-speaking voice, and horrible-smelling breath. Rarity and Rainbow ask the Bufogren about the Amulet of Aurora, but they are unable to endure his foul breath long enough to hear him talk. Using some nearby mint leaves and a tuft of cloud collected by Rainbow Dash, Rarity produces a paste that, upon ingestion, leaves the Bufogren's breath smelling minty fresh. They ask him again about the amulet, and the Bufogren points them to a trail of Azurantium leading up the mountain.\n Rarity tells Rainbow Dash to fly up and retrieve the amulet, but Rainbow brings Rarity along, not wanting to leave her behind in the swamp. On a ridge up the mountainside, they come across a locked door, and Rarity picks the lock using the stiletto heel of one of her recently purchased boots. Rainbow apologizes to Rarity for the harsh words she said earlier, admitting that some of her interests are actually cool. Likewise, Rarity apologizes for treating Rainbow's interests as less important than her own. The two reconcile with a hug and head through the unlocked door together.\n On the other side of the door, Rarity and Rainbow Dash wind up back at the School of Friendship, and at the end of the trail of Azurantium, they find Spike holding the Amulet of Aurora. Twilight and Starlight reveal that they set up a fake artifact theft to get Rarity and Rainbow to work together and resolve their differences. Rarity and Rainbow admit that they truly needed this lesson, and the students learn that two individuals don't have to love the same things in order to have fun together and that sharing in each other's interests makes their friendship interesting and exciting.\nWith a little time left in their day together, Rainbow and Rarity decide to go shopping for new buckball gear for Rainbow and buckball fan attire for Rarity so she can cheer for Rainbow during games.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Fluttershy and Angel picking flowers together in the forest. All of a sudden, a loud, discordant noise scares all the birds away, and Fluttershy fears the sound is coming from a creature in trouble or pain. When she follows the sound to its source, however, she discovers Pinkie Pie playing a large, bagpipe-like instrument\u2014and playing it so poorly that Angel plugs his ears with his own tail fluff.\nLater, Pinkie continues to play her instrument poorly in Ponyville, causing anyone who hears to run away in cringing pain. Twilight Sparkle identifies the instrument as a \"yovidaphone\", a popular instrument from Yakyakistan that produces a pleasant sound when played well. Despite having little talent playing the yovidaphone, Pinkie greatly enjoys playing it, and her friends support her new hobby, believing she will improve her musical talent with enough time.\n Unfortunately, Pinkie's yovidaphone playing causes constant disruptions for her friends' daily activities. It distracts Rarity's sewing at Carousel Boutique, wakes up Fluttershy's animal friends from their sleep, interrupts Rainbow Dash's Wonderbolts flight show, and explodes all of the Apple family's harvested apples at Sweet Apple Acres into applesauce. In addition, Pinkie's musical ability fails to improve.Applejack, Rarity, Fluttershy, and Rainbow Dash inform Twilight about Pinkie's poor yovidaphone playing and constant distractions. When Twilight tries finding a magic spell around this dilemma, Applejack insists they be honest with Pinkie, reminding Twilight of when she had to be honest with Princess Celestia about her acting ability.\nAs Pinkie drives more ponies away with her poor music, her friends approach her outside Sugarcube Corner. By this time, Pinkie Pie loves playing the yovidaphone so much, her friends cannot bring themselves to tell her the truth about her poor playing ability. After a bit of dodging the issue, the ponies eventually tell Pinkie that she's terrible at playing the yovidaphone and shouldn't waste her time with something she's bad at.\n Pinkie appears visibly shaken by this news at first, but she accepts her friends' advice and agrees to stop playing the instrument, much to her friends' relief. However, as she watches a garbage collector pick up the discarded yovidaphone from her bedroom window that evening, Pinkie Pie is revealed to be completely heartbroken over her decision. The next day, Twilight and Spike enter the Ponyville marketplace and find Pinkie Pie sulking. As a result of her decision to stop playing the yovidaphone, her coat has lost some of its color, and her mane and tail have gone flat. In an effort to cheer Pinkie up and make her forget what she's bad at, her friends decide to remind her of all the things she's good at.\nFluttershy organizes a tea party for Pinkie at the Sweet Feather Sanctuary, Applejack throws a party with party cannons at Sweet Apple Acres, Rainbow Dash bakes cupcakes with Pinkie at Sugarcube Corner, and Rarity styles her mane at Carousel Boutique. However, their efforts fail to lift Pinkie's spirits, and she remains permanently distressed, getting grayer and grayer by the minute. In a last-ditch effort, Twilight proposes a \"Pinkie Pie Appreciation Day\" to remind Pinkie of what she's the best at: being everyone's friend.\n The rest of the Mane Six organize a big party in Pinkie Pie's honor in the town square and expect Gummy to bring her. When Gummy arrives to the party without Pinkie, the ponies decide to get her themselves. However, when Twilight teleports them into Pinkie's bedroom, they discovery that all of her belongings are gone, having been packed up by her sister Maud. Maud explains that Pinkie asked her to pack up her things and bring them to the Pie family rock farm because she's decided to move away to Yakyakistan and appreciate yovidaphone music by those who can actually play the instrument.\nUnable to accept Pinkie's sudden decision to leave, Twilight and the others resolve to go to Yakyakistan and convince her to come back home.\n Upon arriving in Yakyakistan, the ponies follow the sound of beautiful yovidaphone playing to a yak hut, where a yak named Yigrid is playing music on a stage and Pinkie Pie is drowning her sorrows in ice cream sundaes. When her friends approach and try to get her to return home, Pinkie quickly agrees to do so. Unfortunately, her sour mood doesn't change because hearing good yovidaphone music makes her feel miserable about her lack of talent.\nAs Yigrid takes a break from playing and asks Pinkie to watch her yovidaphone for her, Pinkie looks slightly happy casually playing a few notes, but she quickly stops before her friends get upset. Twilight and the others realize they were wrong to make Pinkie stop doing something she enjoys so much, and they encourage her to continue playing the yovidaphone as long as it makes her happy. Pinkie Pie is nervous about playing poorly in front of a crowd of yaks, but her friends urge her to play nonetheless.\n With her friends' support, Pinkie takes the stage and starts playing the yovidaphone just as poorly as always, and the color in her coat and mane returns. When she finishes playing, the yaks unexpectedly cheer and applaud. Yigrid returns from her break and tells Pinkie that as long as playing the yovidaphone makes her happy, any amount of playing\u2014no matter how bad it sounds\u2014is perfect. Overjoyed, Pinkie keeps playing music for her friends and audience."}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Trixie putting on a magic show in Ponyville, with Starlight Glimmer serving as her stage assistant. Trixie greatly impresses the crowd of ponies with her disappearing act of escaping from a locked trunk. At the end of the show, Twilight Sparkle and Princess Cadance compliment Trixie on her illusions, as well as her and Starlight's on-stage chemistry, comparing Starlight and Trixie's relationship with their own.\nAs Starlight leaves to return to her job as guidance counselor at the School of Friendship, Trixie is approached by a Saddle Arabian unicorn named Hoo'Far, who also expresses his great approval for Trixie's magic act. He asks Trixie to perform her show in Saddle Arabia, but Trixie is unsure about traveling such a far distance, especially considering the poor condition of her traveling caravan.\n In an effort to convince Trixie, Hoo'Far offers to trade his much more impressive-looking caravan for hers, but she refuses to part with her caravan for sentimental reasons. Thus, Hoo'Far resolves to follow Trixie on her magic tour and see as many of her shows as possible so that he can tell her fans about it when he returns home. Upon hearing that she has a lot of fans in Saddle Arabia, Trixie goes to the school to tell Starlight and invites her to come along on the trip, and Starlight eagerly accepts.\n As Starlight and Trixie set out on their road trip to Saddle Arabia, Trixie notes that her caravan might be too small for the both of them and understands if Starlight wants to back out of the trip. However, Starlight is very excited to go on a trip with her best friend and mentions that there are plenty of inns to choose from on their way to Saddle Arabia. During their travels, they pass through such locations as Ghastly Gorge, the Flame Geyser Swamp, and a crocodile-infested bog, all while cheerfully singing the song We're Friendship Bound. Along the way, they run into Hoo'Far, who once again offers to trade his caravan for Trixie's.\nAfter some time spent traveling, Starlight and Trixie stop in the desert village of Somnambula. The two start to get on each other's nerves when Starlight wastes some of their bits on street food and Trixie insists on waiting in a long line to buy haycakes and juice from a specific kiosk. After hours of waiting in line, they try to check in at the Get On Inn for the night, but there are no vacancies left by the time they reach the front desk. Upon finding that all of the inns in the area are full, Trixie briefly blames Starlight for not making a reservation but quickly apologizes for getting frustrated.\n With nowhere to stay in the village, Starlight and Trixie are forced to spend the night in Trixie's cramped caravan. Their frustration grows further when Starlight keeps bumping her hooves against Trixie's boxes of magic supplies, she keeps Trixie awake with her loud snoring, and Trixie keeps Starlight awake by talking in her sleep. The next morning, Starlight and Trixie get on each other's nerves even more when Starlight eats all of the haycakes and Trixie drinks all of their juice. When they perform a magic show in the village square later that day, their increasing frustration with each other negatively impacts their performance.\n On the second night of their stay in Somnambula, Starlight and Trixie passive-aggressively air their grievances with one another during a campfire. Their frustration and anger toward each other eventually results in Trixie letting Starlight have the entire caravan to herself while she sleeps outside in the bushes so that they can each have their space. Hoo'Far overhears their loud arguing from his own caravan.\nThe next morning, Trixie awakens to discover her caravan is gone. When Starlight emerges from her good night's sleep in Hoo'Far's caravan, she reveals that she traded Trixie's caravan for his. Even though she kept all of her personal belongings and magic supplies in the exchange, Trixie breaks down in tears over losing her precious caravan, and Starlight accuses her of valuing her caravan more than their friendship. Trixie angrily berates Starlight for trading her caravan away and regrets inviting Starlight on the road trip, and Starlight decides to take Hoo'Far's caravan and return home to Ponyville.\n As Trixie continues on to Saddle Arabia alone, dragging her luggage along with her, she once again runs into Hoo'Far, who has made himself at home in Trixie's old caravan. Trixie demands that Hoo'Far reverse their caravan trade, and she lies in the road to stop him from leaving unless he agrees. Meanwhile, Starlight has considerable difficulty pulling Hoo'Far's caravan back to Ponyville by herself, and she encounters a pair of mailponies who had similar disagreements earlier and were inspired by Starlight and Trixie's song to make amends.\n When Starlight catches up with Trixie and Hoo'Far, Starlight apologizes to Trixie for trading away something that wasn't hers to trade away in the first place, and she asks Hoo'Far for a trade reversal. Hoo'Far agrees to reverse the trade if Starlight and Trixie can demonstrate what good friends they are.\nStarlight and Trixie attempt to convince Hoo'Far of this by performing their own, awkward version of Twilight and Cadance's \"sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake\" dance. Despite the clumsy and impromptu nature of Starlight and Trixie's friendship dance, Hoo'Far agrees to a reverse exchange of the caravans. However, he advises that they return to Ponyville instead of continuing on to Saddle Arabia in their exhausted condition.\n Back in Ponyville, Starlight apologizes again for ruining their trip to Saddle Arabia, but Trixie remarks that even time spent on the road by herself can be irritating. Nonetheless, Starlight is glad that they made the attempt, and Trixie agrees, believing the experience made their friendship stronger than ever."}, {"summary": " The episode begins at the Cutie Mark Crusaders' clubhouse, with Scootaloo calling a meeting of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club to order and Rainbow Dash herself spying on the meeting from outside. As soon as she calls the meeting to order, however, Scootaloo very quickly rushes through the meeting and dismisses the other club members from the clubhouse, much to Rainbow's confusion. Once alone in the clubhouse, she takes down all of the Rainbow Dash memorabilia and puts up new memorabilia in its place before calling to order the first meeting of the \"Washouts Fan Club\"\u2014of which Scootaloo is currently the only member.\nHaving watched from outside, Rainbow Dash barges in and demands to know what's going on. Despite her attempts to hide her new fan obsession, Scootaloo admits that she is branching out into other fan clubs aside from Rainbow's. She explains that the Washouts are a new troupe of stuntponies that perform stunts far more extreme and dangerous than those performed by the Wonderbolts. Rainbow Dash is shocked and worried that Scootaloo no longer finds the Wonderbolts\u2014and her by extension\u2014interesting.\n Later, Rainbow Dash tells the rest of the Mane Six about Scootaloo's new interest and worries that Scootaloo doesn't think she's cool anymore. In order to find out why Scootaloo is so obsessed with the Washouts, Pinkie Pie suggests that Rainbow Dash attend one of their shows, which they are holding in Ponyville that weekend. That weekend, Rainbow Dash, Scootaloo, and their friends go to the stadium where the Washouts' show is being held, with the seats almost completely packed, and Rainbow Dash makes no effort in hiding her bitterness toward this new stunt troupe. As the show begins, a loud announcer introduces the Washouts, and a trio of Pegasi appears in black and green flight suits. With flashy and fiery showmanship, the Washouts impress the crowd by flying through flames and electrically-charged hoops, shooting themselves out of cannons, and soaring through obstacle courses filled with spikes and saw blades. Even Rainbow Dash admits that she is very impressed.\nAt the end of the show, Rainbow Dash takes Scootaloo to meet the Washouts in person, including the thrill-seeking Rolling Thunder and the very short-tempered Short Fuse. When Rainbow introduces herself as one of the Wonderbolts, Rolling Thunder reveals that the Washouts themselves used to be cadets at the Wonderbolt Academy before they were kicked out, hence their team name. Just then, the Washouts' leader appears, and when she removes her helmet, she is revealed to be Rainbow's former lead pony Lightning Dust.\n Despite Lightning Dust's bitterness toward Rainbow Dash over her dismissal from the Academy, she claims that her dismissal is what led to her founding the Washouts in the first place, and Scootaloo is greatly impressed with her death-defying stunts. Lightning Dust brags about the Washouts' recklessness and disregard for safety, and she disparages the Wonderbolts for their strict rules and regulations.\nLightning Dust mentions that there is an open spot on her team, and Scootaloo expresses great interest in joining, but Rainbow Dash forbids it, and Lightning Dust points out that she has to be kicked out of the Wonderbolts first in order to qualify. When Scootaloo considers joining the Wonderbolts just so she can immediately drop out, Rainbow takes her out of the stadium. She decides to show Scootaloo what the other Wonderbolts think about the Washouts.\n At the Wonderbolt Academy, Scootaloo is unimpressed by the Wonderbolts' flight formations, remarking that the Washouts' stunts are more impressive. When Rainbow Dash mentions Scootaloo's interest in joining the Washouts to Spitfire, Spitfire very loudly explains to the filly that the Washouts' stunts are incredibly dangerous and can result in serious and severe bodily harm.\nBack to the Crusaders' clubhouse, Rainbow apologizes to Scootaloo for Spitfire's intense directness and says she is only looking out for Scootaloo's safety. However, Scootaloo is insulted that Rainbow Dash is trying to tell her what she can and cannot do. Rainbow Dash goes about getting rid of all of Scootaloo's Washouts merchandise and putting the merchandise of herself back up, but in the middle of this, she notices that Scootaloo has left.\n As she flies into town searching for her, Rainbow runs into Twilight Sparkle, who has also become a fan of the Washouts after seeing their show. When asked if she knows where Scootaloo is, Twilight says Scootaloo has gone to see the Washouts practice. On their way to the Washouts' stadium, Rainbow expresses frustration that her attempts to deter Scootaloo from wanting to join the Washouts keep falling on deaf ears. Twilight tells Rainbow that she cannot control what Scootaloo does and can only be a good role model to her and hope she makes the right decisions.\n At the Washouts' practice stadium, Rainbow Dash meets with Lightning Dust again. Swallowing her pride, she asks Lightning Dust if she has seen Scootaloo. Lightning Dust reveals, much to Rainbow's horror, that Scootaloo has joined the Washouts as their newest member. Rainbow Dash tries to drag Scootaloo away and make her quit, but Scootaloo pulls away, saying she doesn't need Rainbow to look out for her and has given up trying to be just like Rainbow because she can't fly.\nHowever, Scootaloo still wants to impress others by doing stunts and tricks like the Washouts, and she refuses to listen to Rainbow Dash's attempts to change her mind. Remembering Twilight's words from earlier, Rainbow accepts that Scootaloo has to make and learn from her own decisions, and she watches with disappointment as Scootaloo leaves with her new team members.\n Later that evening, the Washouts hold another stunt show in Ponyville for Scootaloo's official debut. For her debut as a stuntpony, Scootaloo plans to ride her rocket-propelled scooter down a steep hill and fly off a ramp over twenty-two burning wagons. As Lightning Dust flies Scootaloo to the top of the hill, Scootaloo mentions how much she admires Lightning Dust, to the point of starting the first Washouts fan club. When Scootaloo sees the untested rocket up close, she starts to have second thoughts about doing the stunt, but Lightning Dust pressures her to live up to the expectations of the president of Lightning's fan club.\nThe wagons for Scootaloo's stunt are set on fire, and Lightning Dust engages the scooter's rockets, causing Scootaloo to race down the hill at high speed. As she rockets up the ramp and into the air, a rope gets caught on one of the scooter's wheels. All of a sudden, Rainbow Dash appears, zooms past Lightning Dust, and saves Scootaloo from the out-of-control rocket scooter. When she brings Scootaloo back down to the ground, Lightning Dust expresses her great displeasure at Scootaloo for backing out of the stunt. Just then, the other end of the rope caught on the rocket scooter snags Lightning Dust's leg, and she proclaims her lifelong rivalry with Rainbow Dash as she gets dragged off into the sky.\n Scootaloo apologizes to Rainbow Dash for not listening to her about Lightning Dust and the Washouts, and Rainbow Dash apologizes in return for not being a better role model and making Scootaloo feel like she'll never accomplish anything worthwhile. She proposes that the Washouts Fan Club be disbanded and a brand-new fan club be established instead. Some time later, in the Crusaders' clubhouse, Rainbow Dash calls to order the first meeting of the \"Scootaloo Fan Club\"\u2014of which Rainbow is the founder and president and her parents Bow Hothoof and Windy Whistles are members.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins on the island home of Rockhoof, one of the legendary Pillars of Old Equestria. Rockhoof himself is assisting with the digging efforts of Professor Fossil and her archaeological team. However, his brute methods of unearthing old artifacts threatens to damage or destroy them, clashing with the rest of the team's methods of careful and meticulous preservation.\nBefore Rockhoof's digging methods endanger more artifacts, Professor Fossil brings him to the School of Friendship in Ponyville and explains to Twilight Sparkle that Rockhoof is not a good fit for her archaeological team. Twilight is thrilled to have one of the legendary Pillars on the school's staff, and she soon introduces him to her friends and students. Likewise, Rockhoof is delighted to have finally found a place in the modern world where he fits in.\n Later, the students' classes start, and Yona is particularly excited to learn from Rockhoof, admiring his yak-like size and strength. When Rockhoof appears, crashing through the classroom door, he tries to get himself up to speed on Twilight's lesson plan before he starts teaching. Ocellus explains that the class just finished studying about the first time Discord was imprisoned in stone, and Rockhoof believes the class to be about telling stories.\nRockhoof starts telling the class a story of how he once fought an ursa major single-handedly, jumping around the classroom, swinging his shovel, and crashing into things as he reenacts the tale. As Twilight walks through the school halls with Applejack, they hear Rockhoof smash up his classroom as he tells his story. Twilight interrupts the destructive storytelling and brings Rockhoof out to the school's fountain square. She and Applejack tell him that while they understand his troubles fitting in modern places, he needs to tone down the destructive elements of his teaching.\n Just then, what appears to be a raging fire breaks out in a nearby classroom. Springing into action, Rockhoof evacuates the students nearest to the flames and shatters the water fountain in order to redirect the water and put the fire out. However, it is revealed that Spike and Smolder were just having a fire-breathing contest, and Rarity angrily chews Rockhoof out for ruining the quilts that she and her students made. Ashamed for once again acting recklessly and failing to fit in, Rockhoof apologizes and leaves his teaching position.\n Twilight and her friends try to find Rockhoof a suitable job as a mail courier, spa masseuse, and assistant for Zecora, but these all result in similar failure.

Even Stygian has found moderate success as a best-selling novelist. Seeing how well his old friends have adjusted to living in modern-day Equestria, Rockhoof feels more miserable and out of place than ever.\nRainbow Dash suggests finding Rockhoof a job that caters to his experiences as a hero, and the Mane Six get him a job in General Seaspray's Hippogriff navy. When Seaspray's ship runs into thick fog, Rockhoof attempts to navigate the ship using the stars in the sky to guide it. However, due to the stars' positions being different than they were in his time, Rockhoof accidentally steers the ship to crash on the shore. Unable to serve as an efficient navigator, Rockhoof is dismissed from Seaspray's navy.\n Back in Ponyville, with all of his attempts to fit into the modern world having ended in failure, Rockhoof gives up all hope. Remembering the story of Discord's defeat from earlier, he tells Twilight to turn him to stone, deciding that his only use in modern times is as a statue in a museum. Twilight vehemently refuses to carry out Rockhoof's request, but Rockhoof begs her, wanting to be remembered as the hero he used to be rather than the disappointment he is now.\nTwilight tells Spike to take over teaching her classes while she thinks of an alternate solution. As the Young Six express their awe and admiration of Rockhoof in class, Spike enters and informs them that Rockhoof will no longer be teaching them and might soon be turned to stone. Yona is completely shaken by this information, and before the students can ask why, Spike gives them their assignment of writing an essay about heroism.\n At the Castle of Friendship, Rockhoof tries to decide on his statue pose when Yona bursts in. She begs him not to let himself be turned to stone, but Rockhoof says his old stories are not worth much in the modern world. Yona reads Rockhoof the essay she wrote for class, stating she also did not fit in when she first came to Ponyville but has since made close friends. She also tells Rockhoof how much she deeply admires him and wants to be like him when she grows up. After hearing Yona's essay, Rockhoof decides to finish the story he was telling in class, and Yona reveals that the entire school wants to hear it.\nWhen Twilight returns, prepared to carry out Rockhoof's request to be turned to stone, she finds him telling the school students the rest of the story of his confrontation with an ursa major. When he finishes the story, the students excitedly want to hear more, but Rockhoof says no, ready to be turned to stone. Before Twilight can do so, however, she points out that telling stories is the one thing that Rockhoof is good at doing in the modern world.\n To that end, Twilight appoints Rockhoof as Equestria's official keeper of tales. As a living record of its history, she states that Rockhoof's stories could teach and inspire future generations. Rockhoof is still unsure that he will ever truly belong in the modern world, but Yona echoes Twilight's sentiment, stating that Rockhoof belongs just by being her friend.

As he and his friends share a laugh on their way to the library, something inside a nearby drain gives off a faint glow.\n At the school library, the Young Six study for their upcoming test, but Gallus and Smolder have trouble understanding the course material, Silverstream becomes preoccupied by the wonders of indoor plumbing, and Yona dozes off to sleep. Despite this, the six remain in positive spirits.\nCozy Glow overhears them as she organizes library books nearby. She expresses how great it is that they are so relaxed about the upcoming test despite their numerous disadvantages as a group, including Sandbar being more experienced in friendship than the others, Ocellus' inherent nature as a changeling, Silverstream being sheltered from the outside world for most of her life, Gallus and Smolder being averse to friendship as a griffon and dragon respectively, and Yona being a narcissistic yak.\n Cozy Glow offers to lend the Young Six her friendship notes to help them prepare for the test, and when she leaves to retrieve them, the Young Six become uncomfortable around each other. They return to studying, but after hearing Cozy Glow's words, they get upset at each other over trivial matters, and some of them start to wonder if friendship is truly in their nature. Just then, the students hear a strange sound at the far back of the library, and they follow it to an open floor grate with a mysterious crystal root sticking out of it. Inside, they find a large cavern filled with more crystal roots, and they encounter what appears to be Twilight, but she glows and speaks to them in a bizarre, mystical tone. This \"Twilight\" senses that the Young Six are \"not one\", and they tell her that they don't know if friendship is truly in their nature. \"Twilight\" doesn't accept this and decides to give the Young Six a test. If they fail to pass the test before morning, they will remain trapped in the caves forever.\nThe Young Six are all suddenly teleported to different parts of the caverns. Silverstream finds herself in what she believes to be Mount Aris, and she hides under the water when shadows of the Storm King and his Storm Creatures appear. Gallus ends up in a small enclosure that gets even smaller whenever he touches certain shafts of light. Yona finds herself in a nest occupied by hundreds of spiders.\n Smolder encounters two mares having a cute tea party, and she is unable to escape from them. Ocellus encounters a pair of un-reformed changelings who address her as \"Your Majesty\", and she discovers she has taken the form of Queen Chrysalis. Finally, Sandbar encounters what appear to be Rarity and Rainbow Dash, who ask for his help in dealing with an emergency. Sandbar is eager to help, but when he mentions the rest of his friends, \"Rainbow Dash\" says they don't need them.\n Inside his small, shrinking enclosure, an increasingly panicked Gallus assures himself that if this is a test, there must be a solution. He realizes that there are two different colors of lights shining in\u2014touching the pink lights makes the enclosure shrink, and touching the blue lights makes it widen. After touching enough of the blue lights, Gallus makes the enclosure wide enough for him to squeeze out through a small opening before he gets crushed.\nMeanwhile, Smolder's flights through the cave tunnels keep circling her back to the tea party with the two mares. She asks them what she has to do in order to pass her test and escape, and they hint that she likes cute things, but fears admitting it, due to her tough dragon exterior. Begrudgingly, Smolder puts on a cute dress and joins the mares' tea party. Elsewhere, Yona tries to escape the nest of hundreds of spiders. When they corner her, she screams in terror, causing the spiders to back away a little. When Yona realizes the spiders mean her no harm and just want to be her friends, she overcomes her fear of them.\n Back at the caves' entrance, Gallus meets up with Smolder. They notice that the way out of the caves is still open and reason that if any other dragon and griffon were in their situation, they would escape and leave the others behind. Realizing they are different from the average dragon and griffon, they decide to stay and find their friends so that they can all escape together. Meanwhile, Sandbar continues to travel through the caves with \"Rarity\" and \"Rainbow Dash\". When he mentions wanting to go and find his friends, \"Rarity\" and \"Rainbow Dash\" tell him to figure out where his loyalty truly lies.\nWhen Smolder finds Ocellus, Ocellus\u2014still in the form of Queen Chrysalis\u2014is unable to change back to her own form, believing she cannot escape the changelings' terrible past. Smolder assures Ocellus that she has changed for the better, and in an effort to help her overcome her fear, Smolder herself admits that she likes cute things. With Smolder's help\u2014and the promise of being invited to a secret tea party\u2014Ocellus conquers her fears and changes back to normal.\n In another part of the caves, Gallus finds Silverstream cowering in fear, believing the Storm King and his forces are going to terrorize her and her fellow Hippogriffs again. Gallus tells Silverstream that the shadows are just illusions, and he helps her overcome her fear by admitting to his own fear of small spaces. With Gallus's encouragement, Silverstream angrily tells the shadows off, causing them to vanish. With both of their fears conquered, Gallus and Silverstream head to find the rest of their friends.\n At the caves' entrance, Gallus and Silverstream meet up with Ocellus and Smolder, but Yona and Sandbar are nowhere to be found, and the entrance is slowly closing. Just then, Yona arrives with her hundreds of new spider friends\u2014one of which she has named Spindle\u2014and the spiders agree to help them track down Sandbar.\nStill traveling the caves with \"Rarity\" and \"Rainbow Dash\", Sandbar stops and refuses to go any further without the rest of his friends. \"Rarity\" and \"Rainbow Dash\" accuse Sandbar of caring more about his friends than he does about the rest of Equestria. However, Sandbar argues back that he has always admired his teachers because of the values of friendship they uphold, and he refuses to abandon his friends just to make his teachers proud. Because of this, Sandbar passes his test, and \"Rarity\" and \"Rainbow Dash\" vanish just as the rest of the Young Six arrive.\n With the six of them together again, the Young Six return to the cave entrance, but it has closed too much for any of them to fit through. Just then, \"Twilight\" appears before them again, and they realize it is not Twilight but a spiritual manifestation of the Tree of Harmony itself. The Tree explains that, as it grows, so do its abilities. It also explains that the Young Six themselves chose how their biggest fears manifested and that they overcame their fears for each other's sake.\n Because the Young Six passed the Tree of Harmony's test of friendship, they are finally able to return to the school library. There, they explain to Cozy Glow what they experienced underneath the school. They consider telling the Mane Six about what they found, but Cozy begs them not to, realizing it was her words that set off this chain of events in the first place and fearing she might get expelled because of it.\nThe Young Six, exhausted from their ordeal, agree not to tell anyone. They suddenly remember their upcoming test but are too tired to continue studying. As they start to fall asleep, Cozy offers to tell Twilight that they helped her organize the library books so that she'll give them a test extension.

This time, the Map is sending the two to a remote location in Equestria called the Peaks of Peril. Twilight Sparkle explains that the Peaks are inhabited by a race of kind and honest creatures called Kirin and frightening monsters of living fire called Nirik. Despite Fluttershy's reservations about going, Applejack is certain that they can solve whatever friendship problem they have been summoned for.\nWhen Applejack and Fluttershy arrive at the Peaks of Peril train station, a deranged ticket-selling pony warns them that only uncharted territory and wild beasts await them beyond the station. Applejack wants to reach the top of the Peaks as soon as possible, which involves trekking through miles of hazardous terrain, but Fluttershy stops to interact with the local animals. After a brief breakdown in communication, Fluttershy shows Applejack a shortcut through the mountains that the animals told her about.\n Applejack and Fluttershy end up in a small village where they encounter the pony-like Kirin. However, when they try to communicate, the Kirin are completely silent and expressionless, responding only to yes-or-no questions. Unable to figure out what the friendship problem is, Applejack asks if there's anyone in the area that she can talk to, and the Kirin point her on a path leading out of the village. Applejack decides to investigate while Fluttershy stays in the village to try and get more information from the Kirin.\n On the outskirts of the Kirin village, Applejack runs into yet another Kirin. She gets frustrated when this Kirin appears just as silent as the others, but the Kirin is revealed to actually be very talkative. Excited to finally be able to talk to someone, the Kirin introduces herself as Autumn Blaze and takes Applejack to her small cottage home that oversees the entire mountain range. She states that she hasn't talked to anyone ever since she and her fellow Kirin took a vow of silence.\nThrough song, Autumn Blaze explains that the Kirin were once very sociable creatures that loved to talk, sing, and tell jokes. However, a fight broke out between two Kirin one day, and hurtful words were exchanged. The two Kirin's bodies were ignited in fire by their anger, and their arguing quickly spread to the rest of the village, causing everything to go up in flames. To prevent this from happening again, the village leader Rain Shine ordered the Kirin to step through the Stream of Silence, suppressing their voices and emotions.\n Though the village was rebuilt and peace was restored, Autumn Blaze grew bored of the endless silence. One day, she stumbled into a bed of foal's-breath flowers, and she brewed them into a tea that restored her ability to speak. Once again able to express herself vocally, she tried numerous times to talk to her friends, but they rejected her. Rain Shine eventually forced Autumn Blaze to choose between staying with the Kirin in silence or keeping her voice and leaving the village, and Autumn chose to leave.\nApplejack, shocked to learn that the Kirin suppressed their emotions just to avoid hurting each other, realizes this is the friendship problem that she and Fluttershy were summoned to solve. She decides to talk to the Kirin and convince them to restore their voices and let Autumn Blaze return to the village, but Autumn says she used all the foal's-breath flowers to restore her own voice and no new flowers have grown since then. Applejack promises to solve this dilemma and heads back to the village.\n Back at the Kirin village, Applejack regroups with Fluttershy, who has also figured out what the friendship problem is. Fluttershy explains much of what Applejack already found out from Autumn Blaze: the Kirin are usually kind and peaceful, but when they lose their temper, they transform into Nirik\u2014creatures of fire and pure rage. Applejack thinks the Kirin shouldn't stop communicating just to avoid hurting each other's feelings, but Fluttershy thinks they should or else they'll risk destroying their village again and endangering the surrounding forests and animals.\nLike earlier, Applejack and Fluttershy's disagreement turns into a loud argument, drawing the attention of the Kirin. Fearing their arguing could result in the village's destruction again, the Kirin seize Applejack and Fluttershy and carry them toward the Stream of Silence in order to silence their voices and emotions as well. Before they can do so, Autumn Blaze appears and defends Applejack and Fluttershy in her Nirik form.\n Fluttershy is surprised that a Kirin has learned to control their anger, and Autumn Blaze says having emotions is not dangerous\u2014what matters is what one does with them. Autumn addresses her old friends and mentions the laughs and songs they used to share. Applejack and Fluttershy agree that giving up one's emotions just to avoid feeling anger is no way to live and that friends can argue from time to time as long as they don't let it get in the way of their friendship. Convinced by Applejack and Fluttershy's words, one of the Kirin gestures that she wants the cure that gave Autumn Blaze her voice back, but Applejack says there aren't any foal's-breath flowers left to brew the cure. Luckily, one of the squirrels that Fluttershy met earlier tells her it knows where to find more foal's-breath. It guides Applejack and Fluttershy back to the base of the mountain, where the animals are using foal's-breath for their dens.\nApplejack apologizes to Fluttershy for getting upset with her earlier, pointing out that her kindness toward the animals helped them find the flowers. Fluttershy points out, however, that Applejack's honesty with the Kirin led to them seeking out the flowers in the first place. The two make amends for their earlier arguments.\n Applejack and Fluttershy bring the flowers back to the Kirin village, and Autumn Blaze drops the flowers into the Kirin's drinking water. Upon drinking the water, the Kirin are cured of their silence and able to speak again. Rain Shine thanks Autumn Blaze for helping her and the other Kirin realize anger is a natural part of who they are, and she invites Autumn to move back into the village. Overjoyed, Autumn Blaze sings a reprise of her song from earlier, and Applejack and Fluttershy's cutie marks glow to indicate their friendship mission is a success."}, {"summary": " The episode begins outside the Castle of Friendship, where Spike practices more complicated flying maneuvers with Twilight Sparkle's guidance. However, much like Twilight's first attempts at advanced flying, Spike's attempts are clumsy and unbalanced, causing him to frequently crash. When he wonders why Twilight's flying advice is not working, the observing Smolder says it is because Twilight is teaching him to fly like a pony, not a dragon.\nUnder Smolder's instruction, Spike learns to fly more skillfully and gracefully. Spike thanks Smolder for her help, and Smolder comments that her tips are beginner's techniques that young dragons are usually taught by their parents. Later, Twilight approaches Spike in his bedroom and wonders if his being raised by ponies instead of dragons has negatively affected his development. However, Spike is preoccupied with making a \"thank-you\" pillow for Smolder as thanks for her flying lessons.\n Spike gives Smolder the throw pillow he made for her, but Smolder is puzzled by the gift because dragons do not typically use pillows. All of a sudden, something plummets out of the sky and crashes into the ground near them. When the smoke clears, it is revealed to be a portly adult dragon with lime green scales named Sludge. As a result of his crash in Ponyville, Sludge suffers a broken arm and sprained wings.\nSludge dismisses Spike and Smolder at first for being much younger, but upon seeing his difficulty walking and flying, Spike helps him back to Twilight's castle. The Mane Six meet Sludge in the castle throne room and offer to let him stay and recover until he gets back on his feet. Sludge initially refuses to accept help from ponies, but the Mane Six and Spike insist. They mend his broken arm, give him a comfortable room to sleep in, and assist in his physical rehabilitation, much of which he spends pigging out on food and gems.\n After he makes a full recovery, Sludge thanks Twilight and her friends for all they have done for him. He comments how lucky Spike is to have such great friends, and Spike says ever since he was orphaned as an egg, they have become more than just his friends\u2014they are his family. Sludge, pleased to see how much Spike has thrived in a non-dragon environment, confesses that his arrival in Ponyville was no accident. He reveals that he was specifically searching for Spike.\n The Mane Six are shocked to learn that Sludge is Spike's father, and Spike is ecstatic to finally meet one of his birth parents. In the castle throne room, Spike asks Sludge why he was abandoned as an egg. Sludge explains that soon after Spike's mother laid his egg, she was tasked by Dragon Lord Torch to scout for the dragons' next Great Migration path. This would keep her away from the Dragon Lands for years, and feeling Spike deserved to know his mother, Sludge ventured out to search for her.\nSludge's search eventually brought him to the Land of Scale Collectors, a region of Equestria comprised of several floating island prisons and occupied by dragon hunters. When Sludge was caught, he turned himself over to the hunters instead of giving up Spike's egg, and he spent years in captivity not knowing what became of Spike or his mother. Despite Sludge's heartbreaking story, Spike says all that matters is that they are together again.\n Spike has a long list of things he has always wanted to do with his father, and Sludge eagerly agrees to do them all with him if it would make him happy. The two play buckball, exchange Hearth's Warming presents, and bake cupcakes together. However, Sludge appears largely disinterested in the father-son activities and hogs all the cupcakes for himself. When Spike asks Sludge what he wants to do next, Sludge says he is fine with doing whatever Spike wants. He mentions, however, that if he were in Spike's living situation, he would spend all his time acting like a real dragon instead of a dragon raised by ponies. When Spike brings up these concerns with Twilight, Sludge corrects his insensitive remarks by saying he wishes he and Spike had more in common. At Twilight's suggestion, Sludge decides to show Spike some new ways to bring out his inner dragonhood.\nThrough the song Just Can't Be a Dragon Here, Sludge teaches Spike how to live like a dragon raised in the Dragon Lands, including getting rid of all his usual castle comforts, renouncing sugary pony-made foods, and even abandoning cleanliness and good hygiene. He also tells Spike to gather everything pony-related that he once enjoyed and give them to Sludge so that he won't be burdened by them. As Spike leaves to collect more \"cushy pony stuff\", Sludge makes himself comfortable in Spike's bedroom.\n The next morning, Twilight finds Sludge sleeping in Spike's bed, and Spike arrives with more pony food for Sludge, having spent the previous night outdoors. Later, Twilight and her friends find Spike giving Sludge a pedicure in the castle throne room. Twilight starts to worry that Sludge is just taking advantage of Spike, but Spike is happy to do whatever his father asks for the sake of embracing his inner dragon. He also accuses Twilight of being jealous that he has a real parent now and doesn't need her anymore, breaking Twilight's heart.\n Some time later, while skipping rocks in the pond, Smolder finds Spike sleeping outside the School of Friendship. He explains that he was sleeping outside like dragons typically do, but Smolder mentions how contradictory this is since she herself lives inside the school dorms. When Spike explains what Sludge is making him do, Smolder thinks Sludge is treating Spike like a servant instead of a son.\nLater, Sludge finds Spike packing things up in his bedroom. Spike says that since Twilight doesn't approve of Sludge living in the castle, he and Sludge will move somewhere else, much to Sludge's dismay. Smolder then arrives, having found a very uncomfortable cave where Spike and Sludge can live together. Sludge starts to panic and says he still has much to teach Spike about being a real dragon, but Spike says Sludge has already taught him so much. As he and Spike fight over a pillow, Sludge confesses that he is not Spike's father and only pretended to be in order to live a life of castle luxury.\n Spike is heartbroken by this deception, but Sludge argues that he simply did what any other dragon would have done in the same situation\u2014a point of view that Smolder strongly disagrees with. As Sludge takes his leave, Smolder sympathizes with Spike's struggles of finding out who he really is. He approaches Twilight in the castle library, explains what happened with Sludge, and apologizes for snapping at her earlier. Twilight allows Spike to travel to the Dragon Lands more often to learn more about himself, but Spike says he already knows who his real family is.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins at the School of Friendship, where Cozy Glow receives mail from a mail delivery pony, gives a new student directions to class, and helps Silverstream with a crossword puzzle. Due to her advancements in the curriculum and constant help around the school, Cozy has been appointed as Twilight Sparkle's personal friendship assistant.\nWhen Cozy brings the mail to Twilight in her office, Twilight realizes she's late to chaperone the students' field trip to Cloudsdale, but Cozy says she got Rainbow Dash to fill in for her. She had even taken the initiative to plan out Twilight's schedule for the day and catalog all of the school's magical artifacts, and Twilight is both impressed and grateful.\n Meanwhile, Rainbow Dash shows the students the Cloudsdale Weather Factory, but the students are more fascinated by being able to walk on clouds thanks to Starlight Glimmer's magic. Just then, Yona falls through the clouds and plummets toward the ground. When Starlight's magic suddenly fails, she and the other non-winged creatures in the group start falling as well. Rainbow Dash and her fellow winged creatures fly down to save them, and Starlight has no explanation for why her magic suddenly stopped working.\n Rainbow and Starlight return to the school and inform Twilight of what happened. Twilight discovers her own magic starting to fail when she tries levitating a book, and when Fluttershy and Rarity arrive, Rarity reveals that her magic is completely gone. Cozy Glow recalls learning about a creature that devours magic\u2014Lord Tirek\u2014but the other ponies say he is locked up inside Tartarus. Spike enters and coughs up a letter from Princess Celestia summoning Twilight and her friends to an emergency meeting in Canterlot.\nAt Canterlot Castle, Celestia and Luna explain that multiple reports are emerging about ponies' magic suddenly failing, and Princess Cadance reports on similar incidents in the Crystal Empire. A messenger pony delivers a letter from Star Swirl the Bearded, in which Star Swirl says that magic is disappearing from Equestria and estimated to be completely gone in three days. Twilight and her friends volunteer to go to Tartarus to see if Tirek has escaped or masterminded the crisis from behind bars.\n While she and her friends travel to Tartarus, Twilight leaves Starlight Glimmer in charge of the school. Cozy Glow questions this decision after the last time Starlight was left in charge, but Twilight is confident in her ability and asks Cozy to assist her. Cozy eagerly accepts this task and takes Starlight to plan out her schedule as temporary headmare. The next morning, Cozy Glow addresses the school students and assumes the role and responsiblilities of temporary headmare. When asked why Starlight isn't in charge as announced, she explains that Starlight left a note saying she went to help Twilight and the others on their mission and left Cozy in charge during their absence. When Smolder gets suspicious about Starlight's sudden departure, Cozy accuses her of not trusting her teachers enough and assigns her extra homework. The rest of the Young Six side with Smolder and demand that they be assigned extra homework as well.\nThat evening, Sandbar overhears some students talking about what a great headmare Cozy Glow is, and he meets his friends in the school library for a homework party. Gallus is suspicious about Cozy Glow's efforts to get the students to like her, but Ocellus thinks she's just trying to keep everyone's minds off the disappearing magic. Just then, the Young Six notice Cozy Glow coming out of the floor grate that they discovered in What Lies Beneath, and they decide to see what she is truly up to.\n They follow Cozy Glow to the headmare's office, where Chancellor Neighsay sits in Twilight's chair. Fed up with Twilight neglecting the school to go on adventures and leaving a filly in charge, Neighsay decides to step in as the new principal, much to Cozy Glow's annoyance. Believing the non-pony students are responsible for the disappearing magic, Neighsay declares the school to be for ponies only so that they can unite against outside threats. Elsewhere, the Mane Six are traveling to Tartarus without magic to shield them from bugs and rainfall, or keep their snacks from spoiling. Applejack provides her friends with apple balm to ward off the bugs, Fluttershy finds a blueberry bush, and Rainbow Dash gathers some clouds together to protect them from the rain. When they reach the gates of Tartarus, Twilight notices the seal is still intact, meaning Tirek has not escaped. However, she is unable to open the doors without her unicorn magic. Luckily, Spike finds an object that Cozy Glow packed for them: the Key of Unfettered Entrance, the magic of which can open any door.\nTwilight uses the Key to open the way into Tartarus, but it shatters as soon as it is used. Inside, the ponies find several creatures in cages\u2014including a cockatrice\u2014all of whom have lost their magical abilities as a result of the disappearing magic. They run into the Tartarus guardian Cerberus, and Fluttershy convinces him to let them pass and talk to Tirek. The Mane Six approach Tirek in his cage and accuse him of being involved in Equestria's magic crisis. Tirek denies having any involvement in such a wasteful scheme, but he offers to give the ponies more information in exchange for his freedom.\n Rainbow Dash points out that even if they release Tirek, there's no escape from Tartarus without any magic. The ponies realize they are all trapped in Tartarus, and Tirek is satisfied that his \"little protege\" helped him carry out his revenge. When asked about this, he explains that he and his accomplice have never met face-to-face, communicating only through letters, and that he told his accomplice how to drain Equestria's magic. With all of them trapped together with no means of escape, Tirek decides to reveal his accomplice's identity.\n Neighsay and Cozy Glow catch the Young Six spying on them outside Twilight's office door, and Neighsay uses his magic medallion to tie them up in chains. As punishment for their alleged crime of stealing Equestria's magic, Neighsay decides to contact their parents and guardians to take them home. Suddenly, Sandbar speaks up and sides with the Chancellor and his views, and his friends are shocked by his betrayal. Neighsay is pleased by Sandbar's change of heart and lets him go, and the two lock the rest of the Young Six inside the student dorms.\nSandbar's betrayal turns out to be a ruse, however, and he goes to Sweet Apple Acres to get the help of Apple Bloom and the Cutie Mark Crusaders. Sandbar and the Crusaders track Cozy Glow into the catacombs under the school library and find an elaborate crystal chamber. There, they find Starlight Glimmer trapped in a sphere of magic, contrary to Cozy Glow's earlier claim that she left to help Twilight and the others on their mission.\n Cozy Glow, who turns out to be Tirek's accomplice, suddenly emerges from the shadows. Sandbar and the Crusaders are shocked to discover that not only is she evil but also that she is the one responsible for stealing Equestria's magic.

But Twilight comes up with the idea of harnessing the natural magic inside the various creatures locked up in Tartarus' cages.\n Back at the school, Cozy Glow enters the office of \"Headstallion\" Neighsay and expresses how relieved she is that he's there to take charge during Equestria's magic crisis. When she brings up Neighsay's duties as the head of the E.E.A., Neighsay says that protecting the school from threats to Equestria is more important than said duties. Promising that the school will be run in accordance with the E.E.A.'s much stricter guidelines, Neighsay dismisses Cozy Glow from the office, and Cozy indignantly walks away.\nMeanwhile, in the catacombs under the school, Sandbar and the Cutie Mark Crusaders try to free Starlight Glimmer from her magic confinement, but whenever they get close, the magic tries to ensnare them as well. With Twilight and her friends trapped in Tartarus and Princess Celestia out of reach in Canterlot, the Crusaders wonder who they can turn to for help, and Sandbar gets an idea.\n In the school dorms, Gallus keeps trying to break out of the locked room, and the rest of the Young Six are still upset over Sandbar's perceived betrayal. Just then, Sandbar appears at the window to let them out, and Yona is thrilled that he didn't truly betray them. After he and the Crusaders explain the situation, Sandbar suggests turning to Chancellor Neighsay for help, believing he will assist them if they explain what's going on. Chancellor Neighsay addresses the school students and declares that Twilight's administration is over and that the school will be shifting over to E.E.A. guidelines. Cozy Glow commends Neighsay for his inspiring speech but points out to the students that there won't be any more lessons taught by Twilight and her friends, causing the students to worry. When Cozy mentions that Celestia and Luna supported Twilight's school and that Neighsay once tried to close it, she incites a full-blown student uprising against Neighsay.\nThe students tie Neighsay up in chains in Twilight's office, and Cozy Glow disposes of his magic medallion. When Neighsay asks Cozy why she's doing this, she explains that because friendship is the most powerful force in the world, she wants to take over the school and harness the friendship of its students to become the most powerful pony in Equestria. As Cozy Glow exits the office, the Cutie Mark Crusaders appear before her to serve as a diversion. They congratulate her on becoming the school's new headmare and ask if they can help in any way. Cozy explains that she needs help cleaning the school, but upon leading the Crusaders to a supply closet, she locks them inside, fully aware that they were just distracting her.\n While the Crusaders keep Cozy Glow occupied, the Young Six sneak into Twilight's office and find Neighsay chained up and trying to retrieve his medallion. Neighsay believes the six have come to gloat, but they release him from his chains and reveal Cozy Glow's true nature and plans to him. With this knowledge, Neighsay uses the remaining magic in his medallion to open a portal to Canterlot so he can inform the princesses. Back in Tartarus, Twilight enacts a plan to channel the magic of its imprisoned creatures to open a way out. Tirek boasts that her plan is futile because every ounce of Equestrian magic will be gone by sunset. Twilight points out, however, that once the magic is gone, Tirek will be trapped forever with the ponies he hates as his permanent company. Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity tire out Cerberus, Fluttershy convinces the other creatures to donate their magic for Twilight's plan, and Pinkie Pie convinces Tirek to help as well by tormenting him with her hyperactive personality.\nThe creatures and Tirek give their magic to Twilight, and Twilight uses their combined magic to open the gates of Tartarus. Twilight and her friends escape through the doors just before they close again. Unfortunately, the sun has already gone down by this time, meaning all the magic of Equestria is now gone for good.\n Sandbar leads his friends back into the catacombs under the school, where Starlight Glimmer is still trapped with the collected magic of Equestria. Ocellus deduces that Cozy Glow has linked the six artifacts from A Matter of Principals together to drain magic from Equestria like a magnet and that removing the artifacts from the circuit should deactivate it. She warns, however, that feedback from the deactivation could destroy the school entirely. Upon hearing this, Cozy Glow appears with the rest of the students and convinces them that the Young Six are trying to destroy Twilight's school as Neighsay forewarned.\nThe Young Six try to convince the other students that Cozy is manipulating them, but Cozy has completely persuaded them to her side, even leading them to believe the Young Six sent Twilight and the others to Tartarus and captured Starlight Glimmer. The students attack the Young Six, and as they try to fight back, Gallus gets caught in the magic sphere with Starlight, and his friends get caught as well while trying to save him. A vortex in the ground suddenly opens up and starts to transport them and Equestria's magic to another location.\n Cozy Glow starts to lead the students away, but the chamber suddenly lights up with the magic of the Tree of Harmony, ignited by the Young Six's friendship and loyalty in one another. As their bodies glow in a manner similar to the Elements of Harmony, the Young Six grab the artifacts and shut off the magic-draining spell, causing all the magic of Equestria to be released and returned to its rightful owners. With her magic restored, Twilight is able to teleport herself and her friends back to the school. Starlight teleports herself and the Young Six to safety, and Cozy Glow angrily curses the Young Six for ruining her plans. When the Mane Six appear to confront Cozy Glow for deceiving them, she tries desperately to save face, but the ponies tell her that Tirek told them everything. Twilight, disagreeing with Cozy's views about friendship, explains that friendship is indeed powerful, but power isn't the sole purpose of friendship.\nTwilight regrets not being able to teach this to Cozy, but the Young Six argue that they wouldn't have been able to defeat Cozy without Twilight's teachings. Cozy Glow callously dismisses the values of friendship and tries to escape so that she can try her plan again somewhere else, but she is stopped by the other students, the princesses, Chancellor Neighsay, and the royal guards.\n Some time later, Neighsay admits to Twilight that she truly is the only one capable of running the School of Friendship. The Young Six appear in graduation gowns, believing saving Equestria from Cozy Glow qualifies them to graduate from school. However, Twilight tells them learning everything about friendship takes more than one semester, much to their disappointment.

Grogar explains that he has brought the villains together to get rid of Twilight Sparkle and her friends. Having observed all the villains' defeats at the hands of the Mane Six, Grogar has identified the secret to their many victories: working together.

When he makes his way to the castle and finds it abandoned, he assumes control of the thrones.\nBack in Ponyville, the Mane Six continue to hold off the Everfree Forest's invading vines, but the vines grow faster than they can keep up with. All of a sudden, Princess Celestia, Princess Luna, and Star Swirl the Bearded arrive to help them with their efforts. Star Swirl, having felt the Tree of Harmony's destruction, had alerted Celestia and Luna, and he offers to keep the forest under control with the princesses while Twilight and her friends go to Canterlot and stop Sombra.\n Twilight teleports herself and her friends to Canterlot's city limits, where their mind-controlled friends and families block their entry into the city. The ponies cannot bring themselves to fight back against their loved ones, instead trapping them in nets and turning their force on each other.\nWhen the mind-controlled forces overwhelm the Mane Six, Twilight teleports herself and her friends into the castle. There, the ponies find Discord free of Sombra's control. Without any other means of fighting Sombra, Twilight begs Discord to help them defeat him. Discord agrees, despite his misgivings about doing the ponies' work for them, and they fight past Sombra's brainwashed legion.\n In the castle throne room, Sombra creates black crystals all around the room. When the Mane Six and Discord enter to stop him, Sombra blasts at them with his magic. While Discord is easily able to fend off Sombra's blasts, he expresses further his hope that Twilight and her friends would defeat Sombra on their own. When Discord states Fluttershy is his favorite among the Mane Six, Sombra aims his magic directly at her, and Discord jumps in the way, taking the full brunt of the blast and falling.\nWith Discord seemingly defeated, Sombra believes he has truly won. Discord, drained of his power and barely conscious, tells the Mane Six they do not need him, the princesses, or the Elements of Harmony to defeat Sombra. He says the six of them will always embody the virtues of harmony they each represent, and as long as they stand together, they will always triumph. As Sombra laughs off Discord's sentiment, the Mane Six stand firmly united against him, inspired by Discord's words.\n Sombra barrages the ponies with magic, but Twilight matches him blow-for-blow, saying no matter how many times they are knocked down, she and her friends will keep getting back up again and again. During Twilight and Sombra's final clash, Twilight joins hooves with her friends, and the magic within them ignites similarly to the Elements of Harmony from their resolve to protect Equestria. With a declaration of \"friendship is magic!\", the Mane Six's magic eradicates Sombra to dust, dispels\u00a0his black crystals around the land, and frees the mind-controlled ponies from his spell. Celestia and Luna enter the throne room to find the Mane Six nursing Discord back to health. Twilight fears the princesses are disappointed that she did not alert them about Sombra right away and believes she is unfit to rule Equestria. However, Celestia remarks that a good leader knows when to ask for help, but a great leader has the courage to admit their mistakes and the strength to make up for them.\nWhile the princesses believe Twilight has proven she possesses these qualities, they admit that they unfairly put too much pressure on Twilight all at once, and they decide to continue ruling Equestria until Twilight is truly ready to take their place. Twilight is immensely relieved by the princesses' decision, but Discord is upset, revealing he merely pretended to be hurt during the battle against Sombra in order to inspire the Mane Six to defeat him. Regardless, the Mane Six are reminded of how much of an unstoppable force they are when they stand together.\n Meanwhile, back at Grogar's lair, Cozy Glow tries to foster teamwork between herself, Lord Tirek, and Queen Chrysalis. When Grogar enters, he shows them the moment of Sombra's defeat with his crystal ball, and he uses Sombra's hubris as an example to secure Tirek, Chrysalis, and Cozy's loyalty."}, {"summary": " The episode begins in a collective dream shared by all of the Young Six: Silverstream dreams of becoming the first non-Pegasus member of the Wonderbolts, Ocellus dreams of missing an entire year's worth of classes and having to take a final exam in order to graduate, Yona dreams of plummeting out of the sky, Smolder dreams of having a tea party in a cute dress, Gallus dreams of being trapped in a small space, and Sandbar dreams of having to choose between multiple snacks to eat.\nThe Tree of Harmony's transparent projection of Twilight Sparkle that appeared to the Young Six in What Lies Beneath appears before them again, having summoned them into the same dream space. She ominously tells the Young Six that the Tree needs them, and they wake up from their shared dream.\n The next morning, at the School of Friendship, Twilight races to get everything ready for the new school year when the Young Six arrive, far earlier than Twilight expected them. When they explain that they were summoned by the Tree of Harmony, Twilight and Spike inform them that the Tree\u2014as well as the Elements of Harmony\u2014were destroyed by King Sombra. This comes as devastating news to the Young Six, who had felt a special connection to the tree since the year before, and they ask to see its remains for themselves. In the cave underneath the Castle of the Two Sisters, the Young Six see what remains of the Tree of Harmony and mourn its loss. At Gallus' suggestion, the six friends decide to honor the Tree's memory in some way, believing this to be the reason it summoned them. However, Thorax arrives and angrily reprimands Ocellus for leaving the Changeling Kingdom without telling anyone. When Ocellus' friends explain the situation, Thorax allows Ocellus to stay, and Twilight lets the rest of the Young Six stay as well\u2014as long as they also have permission from their respective kingdoms.\nBack at their homes, each of the Young Six gets permission from their families and kingdom leaders to carry out their mission of helping the Tree of Harmony. By the time they return to the cave, Sandbar\u2014who lives closest\u2014has cleared away the Tree's remains entirely to make room for a small sapling replacement. His friends disapprove with his idea to memorialize the Tree, and they each have a different idea about how the Tree's memory should be honored. When they are unable to reach an agreement, Yona suggests coming up with an idea they all like, but the others refuse.\n Gallus' idea to memorialize the Tree of Harmony is to turn the cave that houses it into a museum that embellishes its origins. Smolder's idea is to sculpt a giant rock statue of the Tree as a monument to its power. Silverstream's idea is to cover the cave's walls and floor in colorful paint. Finally, Ocellus' idea is to build a meditation garden with a water fountain and wind chimes. When the five ideas conflict with each other, it makes a giant mess of the cave. As Ocellus, Gallus, Smolder, Sandbar, and Silverstream all blame each other for the mess and failing to honor the Tree of Harmony properly, Yona breaks up the arguing and reminds them of what the Tree meant to them. They recall hiding together in the Castle above and later having their friendship tested by the Tree itself. The rest of the Young Six decide to work together, but they are still unsure of how to memorialize the Tree.\nUsing the Tree's remains that Sandbar set aside in a wooden cart, Yona comes up with the idea of constructing a treehouse, and the Young Six work together to build it while singing the song The Place Where We Belong. Although the treehouse turns out ugly and small when it is finished, the Young Six are satisfied and proud because of what it represents. All of a sudden, magic envelops the little, shabby treehouse and transforms it into a grand, crystal treehouse in the middle of the Castle of the Two Sisters' courtyard.\n The spirit of the Tree of Harmony appears before the Young Six once again and commends them for keeping its spirit alive with their friendship and selflessness. Twilight arrives, having sensed a burst of magic from the school, and sees the grand treehouse that has appeared. The Young Six explain what happened, and Twilight reasons that the Tree and the Elements still remain, changing to suit Equestria's needs and needing the Young Six's help to do so.\nWith the Young Six's mission complete, they, Twilight, and Spike decide to check out the interior of the new \"Treehouse of Harmony\".\n"}, {"summary": " At the School of Friendship, Spike excitedly enters Twilight Sparkle's office with a recently-arrived scroll from Twilight's brother Shining Armor. The scroll depicts a toy crown, and Twilight immediately realizes what it means. They explain to Starlight Glimmer that Twilight and Shining Armor had frequent competitions when they were little, including kite-flying and getting good grades, and whoever won the most competitions at the end of each week would earn the crown as well as the title of \"Sibling Supreme\"\u2014a title that Spike has also long coveted.\nShining Armor invites Twilight to Canterlot Castle for their final Sibling Supreme competition.\n Upon arriving at Canterlot Castle, Twilight and Spike meet with Princess Celestia, Princess Luna, and Shining Armor\u2014wearing the Sibling Supreme crown. They explain that, in the wake of King Sombra's recent return, they have decided to reinforce the castle's defenses. Despite Luna's insistence that they handle the task themselves, Celestia has appointed Shining Armor for the task, and he needs someone to test the new defense systems.\nAmong Shining Armor's new castle defenses are an anti-magic field made from the shards of Queen Chrysalis' throne, giant fans that prevent getting in from the air, brick walls over the entrances to the castle's underground tunnels, doubled and round-the-clock royal guard security, doors that only open with royal guard medals, a trap door, and an alarm system of geese. Shining Armor tells Twilight that if she can get past all these defenses and steal the crown without getting caught, she will earn the title of Sibling Supreme forever.\n Back at the Castle of Friendship, Twilight explains the situation to her friends and organizes an elaborate heist to steal the crown, and her friends agree to help pull it off. Playing to everyone's strengths, Twilight tasks Pinkie Pie with distracting the guards with a party, Applejack with breaking into the underground tunnels, Rainbow Dash with getting past the blowing fans, Rarity with making guard costumes, and Fluttershy with charming the geese. Unfortunately, Shining Armor sends another scroll and says he has already predicted and accounted for all of these measures.\n Rarity suggests doing the opposite of what Shining Armor expects them to do, and she takes charge of the operation, telling each of the ponies to come up with their own part of it. She and Rainbow Dash decide to interrogate the local bar scene about other secret passages into the castle tunnels. Pinkie Pie decides to serve as the team's lookout\u2014from outer space. Applejack offers to distract the guards with her country music-singing persona \"Apple Chord\". Fluttershy and Spike offer to infiltrate the castle like super-spies. Finally, Rarity tells Twilight to do nothing whatsoever.\n Using the Twinkling Balloon and a flight path provided by the Wonderbolts, Pinkie Pie drops Fluttershy and Spike off so they can enter the castle through the vents before she goes up into the clouds. On the ground, Shining Armor finds Twilight hanging out outside the castle and suspects she is up to something, but Twilight denies it. All of a sudden, Pinkie goes flying out of control when her hot air balloon springs a leak. Applejack takes advantage of the distraction this causes to steal one of the guards' medals.\nMeanwhile, Rarity and Rainbow Dash head to a nearby juice bar to \"shake down ne'er-do-wells for information\", but the bar is closed. A local stallion points them in the direction of a blocked-off entrance into the underground tunnels, but it is guarded by the recently-hired Zephyr Breeze. Remembering Zephyr's big crush on Rainbow, Rarity outfits her in a pretty dress and convinces her to distract Zephyr by swooning over him. With Zephyr pulled away from his post, Rarity unseals the entrance into the tunnels.\n Elsewhere, Fluttershy and Spike infiltrate the throne room via stained glass window and try to steal the crown, but they quickly alert the geese. As the geese honk loudly, Fluttershy and Spike trigger the trap door near the thrones and fall inside. When Luna comes to investigate and finds the throne room empty, she believes it to be a false alarm. With no lookout, no distraction, and no word from the ponies inside the castle, Twilight fears the entire heist is a failure. Inside the trap door under the throne room, Fluttershy succumbs to claustrophobia, remembering the time she got similarly trapped in the Castle of the Two Sisters and was separated from Angel. She recalls fearing that Angel felt alone and forgotten, and Spike sympathizes, having always felt like Twilight and Shining Armor's little brother during their sibling rivalries but unsure if they felt the same way about him. Fluttershy assures Spike that he is special to Twilight and Shining Armor, mentioning that her own brother Zephyr Breeze could learn a lot from him about being a brother.\nJust then, an entrance from the trap door into the underground tunnels opens when Rainbow Dash pulls a torch lever, and she and Rarity reunite with Fluttershy and Spike. Unable to navigate the maze-like tunnels, the group decides to turn back and meet up with the others to reevaluate their plan.\n Back outside the castle, Twilight nervously paces back and forth while waiting to hear from the rest of their friends. When Rarity and the others appear from inside a vent, they inform Twilight that their parts of the plan all failed as well, and Twilight despairs that she will never get the crown. Spike suggests they go back to Twilight's original plan, even though Shining Armor is expecting it. With the rest of her friends in agreement, Twilight decides to give it a shot and thanks Spike for the well-needed encouragement. In accordance with Twilight's original plan, Pinkie Pie distracts the guards with a party, Rainbow Dash carries Fluttershy as she zooms past the blowing fans, Applejack breaks into the sealed-up underground tunnels with assistance from Maud Pie, Rarity poses as a royal guard to get past security, and Fluttershy calms down the honking geese. Once inside, everyone regroups in the throne room, and Twilight sees the crown within sight. Unfortunately, Shining Armor appears to stop them, having predicted Twilight's whole plan as he previously warned.\nJust before Celestia can declare Shining Armor as permanent Sibling Supreme, Spike holds the crown for himself, having conspired with Princess Luna the entire time. He explains that he sensed Celestia and Luna's disagreement regarding castle security earlier and made a deal with Luna. She deliberately appointed Zephyr Breeze to guard the tunnels and kept Celestia out of the castle hallways, while Spike sabotaged Pinkie's hot air balloon and made sure the Mane Six went back to Twilight's original plan. Finally, during Shining Armor's victorious gloating, Luna teleported the crown directly into Spike's hands.\n Celestia half-heartedly apologizes to Luna for disregarding her earlier concerns and begrudgingly agrees that they need to account for both inside\u00a0and outside\u00a0threats to castle security. With both Twilight and Shining Armor having lost the competition, they declare Spike to be the true Sibling Supreme and the little brother they have always had, and everyone gathers around him for a group hug."}, {"summary": " The episode begins with mail delivery pony Derpy delivering a large package to the School of Friendship for Twilight Sparkle. Princess Celestia explains via magic scroll that she found some of Twilight's old belongings during a cleaning of Canterlot Castle. Among the collected knickknacks from Twilight's childhood, Spike discovers an old library book that Twilight never returned to the Canterlot Library.\nUnwilling to tarnish her perfect book-borrowing record or disappoint her favorite librarian Dusty Pages, Twilight heads for Canterlot to return the book.\n Outside Canterlot Library, Twilight hides her face from the shame of setting a bad example for other library book-borrowers, but Spike tells her that everyone makes mistakes, including princesses. Inside, they meet with the new head librarian, who does not know who Dusty Pages is, and Twilight tries to return her old library book, suddenly realizing how much she might be fined for late fees.\nThe librarian tells Twilight to see First Folio in the library's Office of Overdue Returns in the basement, but when Twilight and Spike go there, they discover that First Folio is out to lunch somewhere on Restaurant Row. Spike suggests trying again at a later time, but Twilight refuses to put off returning the book any longer, and she proposes going to find First Folio at the restaurant where she is having lunch.\n Twilight and Spike's search for First Folio leads them to Coriander Cumin and Saffron Masala's restaurant, The Tasty Treat. As Spike is mistaken for a waiter, Twilight finds Moon Dancer having lunch with First Folio. Moon Dancer and First Folio explain that Dusty Pages left the Canterlot Library long ago, allegedly having been forced to leave because someone checked out a book and never returned it, ruining Dusty's perfect librarian record. Twilight is horrified at the thought that her overdue book led to Dusty Pages being fired from her job.\n Twilight heads to Dusty Pages' home, believing if she gives Dusty the overdue library book to return to the library herself, she can get her job back. However, Dusty has moved away, and someone else is living in her old house. The stallion living there tells Twilight and Spike that Dusty is now living somewhere that has the word \"Silver\" in its name, and he gives them a large bag of Dusty's unforwarded mail.\nTwilight and Spike travel to various \"Silver\" locations around Equestria in search of Dusty Pages, such as Silver Shoals, but they are unable to find her. Their search eventually leads them to the Silver Stable Retirement Community, and the front desk receptionist tells them Dusty is living in one of the ground floor apartments. All the while, Twilight is convinced that Dusty is miserable over the loss of her job.\n When Twilight and Spike knock on Dusty's front door and realize she is not home, they ask around the community about her whereabouts. Some elderly ponies at the pier tell them Dusty has a busy day of activities, including woodworking, windsurfing, theater, and band practice. Twilight and Spike search for Dusty at these areas around the retirement community, but they always just miss her, arriving moments after she has left. When Twilight and Spike finally catch up with Dusty Pages, she is playing lead guitar in a band of elderly ponies. Spike thinks Dusty looks perfectly happy, but Twilight believes she is merely masking the pain of losing her job. As Twilight interrupts band practice, she and Dusty have a happy reunion. Dusty is surprised to learn that Twilight was the one who broke her perfect librarian record, and when Twilight offers to help set things right and get Dusty's job back, Dusty refuses and bitterly storms off.\nTwilight falls into despair\u2014not only because of her guilt of getting Dusty fired, but also because of her own tarnished book-borrowing record and the late fees she is still racking up. With Spike's encouragement, she vows to find out why Dusty refuses to return to the library. Twilight and Spike follow Dusty to the grounds of a fruit-tossing food fight tournament, and Dusty declares a timeout so they can talk.\n Twilight expresses her immense guilt over causing Dusty to lose her job and asks how she can make up for it, but Dusty reveals that she was never fired. She explains that after years of trying to maintain her perfect record, having it broken made her realize perfection is not everything, and she left her job voluntarily in order to live life the way she truly wanted. This point is further emphasized by the title of Twilight's overdue book: Perfection: The Impossible Pursuit. Back at the Canterlot Library, First Folio adds up Twilight's late fees for the overdue book, which come out to only twenty-eight bits. Twilight eagerly pays the amount, and since the book has long been replaced by a newer edition, she decides to keep it as a constant reminder that perfection is not everything."}, {"summary": " The episode begins with a newsreel: since the events of Buckball Season, the sport of buckball has grown into a popular phenomenon, and a giant stadium and museum have been established in Appleloosa in recognition of the sport's popularity. In addition, the Ponyville team of Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, and Snails has gained a lot of fame as the sport's current champions. Snips takes advantage of Snails' newfound fame by charging his fans bits for autographs.\nAs Pinkie, Fluttershy, and Snails get ready for an upcoming buckball tournament game, Rainbow Dash goes to the newly built museum to check out the exhibits as a favor to Applejack. In front of the museum, she discovers her old friend and fellow Daring Do fan Quibble Pants camping out to be first in line for when the museum opens. Quibble claims to be a big fan of buckball, but his knowledge of the sport is clearly lacking.\n Suddenly, a unicorn mare and a Pegasus filly arrive, and Quibble introduces Rainbow to his girlfriend Clear Sky and her daughter Wind Sprint. Quibble is excited to go to the museum with Wind Sprint, having camped out all night for her, but Wind appears uninterested in his efforts to bond. Inside the museum, Quibble, Rainbow, Clear Sky, and Wind Sprint split up to check out the exhibits. Quibble explains to Rainbow that Wind Sprint is a big sports fan, her birth father being a famous athlete, and he is trying to bond with her over what she likes, but he is utterly clueless about sports and very unathletic.\nRainbow Dash talks with Wind Sprint, mentioning that she is a member of the Wonderbolts, and tries to convince her that Quibble is a very sporty pony. Wind is skeptical of this, though, especially after Quibble gives her a large buckball almanac as a gift. Clear Sky tells Quibble that he does not need to try so hard to get Wind Sprint to like him. As Quibble starts to lose hope, Rainbow Dash decides to help him bring out his sporty side.\n On a practice buckball field, Rainbow tries to figure out if Quibble possesses the speed, strength, or agility expected of a typical athlete. Unfortunately, after several attempts, it becomes clear that Quibble possesses none of these qualities. As a buckball game gets underway in the nearby stadium, Rainbow Dash comes up with one last idea to \"sportify\" Quibble Pants. In the stadium, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, and Snails win another game to advance to the next round in the buckball tournament. With Rainbow Dash's help, Quibble sets up a meet-and-greet for Wind Sprint to hang out with the Ponyville team, much to Wind's excitement. However, even with Rainbow, her friends, and Clear Sky vouching for Quibble, Wind Sprint is still dismissive of him.\nIn an effort to change this, Rainbow arranges for Quibble, Clear Sky, and Wind Sprint to play an exhibition buckball match against the Ponyville team during the tournament's halftime show. Quibble is nervous about embarrassing himself in front of not just Clear Sky and Wind Sprint but also a packed stadium of buckball fans, but Rainbow Dash assures him that Pinkie and Fluttershy agreed to make him look good.\n Wind Sprint proves to be very talented at the game, but Quibble is so lacking in athleticism and coordination that he unintentionally scores points for the opposing team. He gets into an argument with the referee over the game's rules and tries to keep the match going, but Wind Sprint gets fed up and leaves. Clear Sky gets similarly frustrated with Quibble after she told him to stop trying so hard, and she also leaves, saying she and Quibble have to \"rethink all of this\". Later, outside the stadium, Rainbow Dash approaches Quibble Pants with some more ideas to turn him into a sporty pony. However, Quibble refuses and gives up, convinced that Wind Sprint will never like him no matter what he does. Plus, after the last thing Clear Sky said to him before she left, Quibble believes she is going to break up with him. Deciding to abandon their previous plans, Rainbow Dash realizes Quibble should have gone to someone else to teach him about sports.\nMeanwhile, in the museum, Wind Sprint expresses to Clear Sky that no matter how much she likes him or how many ponies care about him, he is never going to replace her real father. Clear Sky assures Wind that Quibble is not trying to make her stop loving her real dad; he just wants her to like him. When Quibble catches up with them, he apologizes to Wind for pretending to be good at sports and trying so hard to make her like him. He asks if they can start over and for Wind to teach him about sports while they watch the tournament together, and Wind agrees.\n During the next game, Wind Sprint teaches Quibble the rules of buckball, and Quibble teaches her about the Ponyville team's plays using the almanac he gave her. Quibble tells Clear Sky that if she still wants to break up with him, he is fine with it, but Clear Sky says she does not want to break up, with Quibble having misinterpreted her words from earlier. As Quibble finally makes a connection with Wind Sprint, the three enjoy the rest of the game together."}, {"summary": " At the School of Friendship, Twilight Sparkle announces the revival of one of Ponyville's oldest traditions: the Fetlock Fete, a pony-centric dance party. For the sake of all-inclusiveness, Twilight is dubbing the event the \"Amity Ball\" and inviting all creatures to attend. In addition, the dance will feature old Fetlock Fete traditions such as the Pony Pal Contest and potluck dinner. As Twilight and her students leave to hang up posters for the dance, Sandbar asks Yona if she wants to go to the dance and enter the Pony Pal Contest with him. Yona is uncertain because the dance is traditionally focused on ponies, but Sandbar says that does not matter, wanting them to just have fun together. Yona accepts, much to Sandbar's delight, and he leaves to buy the contest tickets. As Yona wonders how to be the best \"pony pal\", Rarity passes by with dresses she is preparing for the dance, leaving Yona worried that she has a lot to learn.\n Yona meets with Rarity at Carousel Boutique and asks for help on presenting herself at the Amity Ball like a pony would, including what to wear and how to act. With a mouthful of Brussels sprouts, Rarity teaches Yona how to articulate and enunciate her speaking. She tries to find a look that will make Yona stand out, but Yona says she wants to fit in, and Rarity attempts to accommodate her wishes through the song Fit Right In. Later, Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash help Yona learn the steps for two traditional pony dances: the slower \"pony cotillion\" and the faster \"pony prance\", both of which are a drastic departure from the wilder yak dances that Yona is accustomed to. At Sweet Apple Acres, Applejack and Pinkie Pie help Yona prepare something for the potluck dinner. After several days of hard practice, Yona has mastered speaking and dancing like a proper lady. Some time later, the School of Friendship's Amity Ball begins, with Spike providing music as \"DJ Scales-n-Tail\". Sandbar's friends tell him that their teachers have been helping Yona get ready for the dance all week. When Yona arrives, they behold the fruits of their hard work: Yona is elegantly dressed and speaking like a high-class pony. Sandbar tells Yona she did not need to go to so much trouble, but Yona feels satisfied that she is finally fitting in. Spike begins the pony cotillion, and Yona invites Sandbar to the dance floor. The dance starts out well enough, with Sandbar impressed by how much Yona has learned, but she briefly trips over her own dress, having not practiced dancing while wearing one. As soon as she recovers, Spike moves on to the pony prance. As with before, Yona and Sandbar have fun dancing at first. However, Yona's pony wig falls over her eyes, and in her state of blindness, she stampedes out of control, knocking over everyone and everything in her path.\nHeartbroken over the mess she caused and feeling like she failed to act like a proper pony, Yona leaves the dance in tears.\n At the Treehouse of Harmony, Yona sings a sad song to herself in her solitude. When Sandbar comes looking for her, Yona is so mortified by what happened that she refuses to leave the treehouse. She fears she disappointed Sandbar by being a terrible pony \u2013 and a terrible \"pony pal\" by extension. Sandbar says he does not care whether Yona is a good pony or a bad pony; he asked her to go to the dance with him because he appreciates her as the \"best Yona\" she already is. Yona hugs Sandbar and agrees to return to the dance with him. Sandbar and Yona return to the school as their friends, teachers, and fellow students clean up the mess. Yona apologizes for ruining the Amity Ball, but Rarity and her friends take the blame for trying to turn Yona into someone she is not. When Yona forgives them and says Sandbar helped her feel better, Twilight declares the two of them the winners of the Pony Pal Contest for exemplifying friendship.\nSpike and the students ask Yona to teach them the \"crazy dance\" she was doing before she left, and Yona happily obliges.

Before he steps out, he commands Cozy, Tirek, and Chrysalis to learn to work together\u2014unconcerned with how they accomplish this\u2014if they hope to achieve their goal of destroying Twilight Sparkle and her friends.\nIn Grogar's absence, Cozy Glow assumes herself in charge and tries to organize a team meeting with Tirek and Chrysalis. However, Tirek is only concerned with getting back the level of power and physique he reached after absorbing all the magic in Equestria, Chrysalis is only concerned with exacting her revenge on Starlight Glimmer, and neither of them recognize Cozy's self-imposed authority. Through the song Better Way to Be Bad, Cozy inspires some trust and cooperation in her fellow villains at first, but they step on each other's lyrics by the end due to their respective egos.\n Grogar returns, frustrated that the three still have not learned to work together. Chrysalis expresses frustration as well because it has been weeks since Grogar summoned them to his lair, and they still do not know what his plan is. Grogar explains that his Bewitching Bell, a talisman that contains the rest of his power, was stolen thousands of moons ago by Gusty the Great and sealed away at the top of Mt. Everhoof. Seeing an opportunity for Cozy, Tirek, and Chrysalis to learn teamwork, Grogar tasks them with scaling the mountain and retrieving the Bell. At the base of Mt. Everhoof, Cozy Glow shares with Tirek and Chrysalis her plan to scale the mountain and claim Grogar's Bewitching Bell, but they disregard her and each set off on their own. Chrysalis heads through the forest, scaring off any creatures that cross her path, and uses her changeling powers to cross the various hazardous terrains. However, once she is near the summit, the heavy mountain winds prevent her from getting any closer.\nOn the main path, Tirek tests the mountain winds and determines them to be too harsh to withstand, so he starts building a campfire.\n Cozy Glow treks up a snowy mountain pass and finds the residence of mountain guardian Rusty Bucket, on patrol to keep anyone from facing Mt. Everhoof's treacherous conditions. Pretending to be a pitiful, lost filly, Cozy Glow tries to convince Rusty Bucket to escort her to the top of the mountain. When Rusty refuses, Cozy loses her temper, and Rusty warns her to keep her voice down or else risk triggering an avalanche. Cozy tries going up the mountain by herself, but all of her attempts fail. In her intense anger, she causes a giant snowball to roll down on top of her and carry her back to the bottom of the mountain.\n At Tirek's campsite, Cozy Glow returns cold and wet, and Tirek ridicules her for failing to reach the mountain's summit. Having already determined the mountain to be too difficult to climb alone, Tirek decided to let Cozy and Chrysalis do all the work and use what they learned from their inevitable failures to his own advantage. Cozy berates Tirek for his constant arrogance, and Tirek likewise criticizes Cozy for her fake cutesy persona and constant manipulations.\nDrawn by the sound of Cozy and Tirek's loud arguing, an Ophiotaurus, a half-bull half-serpent creature, appears to menace them. Before it attacks them, a second, female Ophiotaurus appears, and the first Ophiotaurus becomes infatuated. The female Ophiotaurus is revealed to be Chrysalis, and she uses the other Ophiotaurus' infatuation to feed on its love and weaken it severely. Chrysalis makes it clear to Cozy and Tirek that she only saved them from the Ophiotaurus because she needs their help to get to the top of Mt. Everhoof.\n Gathered around the campfire, Cozy, Tirek, and Chrysalis compare notes about their experiences facing the mountain's elements until the conversation steers toward the Mane Six. The three villains come to realize that as much as they hate each other, they hate Twilight and her friends even more and enjoy making fun of them, taking pleasure in the times they almost defeated them. With this in mind, they decide to cooperate with each other for the sake of destroying the Mane Six. The next morning, Cozy Glow, Tirek, and Chrysalis work together to climb Mt. Everhoof, helping each other along the way. Near the summit, Chrysalis and Cozy create a vine bridge across a chasm, allowing all three of them to reach the peak. Outside the cave housing the Bewitching Bell, they discover a magical barrier preventing entry. Cozy suggests that Tirek absorb the barrier's energy, but Tirek says he can only absorb the energy of living beings.\nCozy then suggests absorbing Chrysalis' magic. Chrysalis perceives this as a betrayal, but Cozy assures her that it would just be for the purpose of breaking through the barrier, after which Tirek will return Chrysalis' magic to her. With Chrysalis' begrudging approval, Tirek absorbs her magic, powering up to his third form, but he only has enough power to create a small opening in the barrier. Cozy Glow, being the only one among them small enough to fit, flies through the opening and returns with the Bewitching Bell before it closes.\n With their mission complete, Tirek gives Chrysalis' magic back to her as promised. The three villains are surprised to find that they enjoyed working together and relying on each other for help. But Chrysalis angrily rejects the sentiment, realizing she and the others almost fell victim to the Magic of Friendship. Fearing how powerful Grogar will be once he has the Bell, the three decide to continue acting as his servants until they are able to usurp him, after which they can go back to trying to destroy one another. Cozy Glow, Tirek, and Chrysalis return to Grogar's lair and tell him that they failed to retrieve the Bewitching Bell. Despite his anger and frustration, Grogar is satisfied that the three were able to work together as he commanded. As he leaves, Chrysalis agrees with Grogar's statement that they are more powerful when they work together\u2014as the Bewitching Bell is hidden from view."}, {"summary": "Smolder enters the Teachers' Lounge at the School of Friendship and asks Headmare Twilight Sparkle for a week off from school. She explains that her \"sweet\" and \"sensitive\" brother has been having a hard time in the Dragon Lands ever since she left home to attend school. Twilight is concerned about Smolder traveling to the Dragon Lands by herself and missing so much class, but Spike suggests making it a \"kindness field trip\" so that she receives school credit and offers to accompany her.\nWhen Smolder also mentions that it is dragon hatching season in the Dragon Lands, Fluttershy eagerly volunteers to come along as well in order to see the newly-hatched baby dragons. Twilight permits this\u2014on the condition that Fluttershy submit a report about dragon-hatching when she returns.\n When Smolder, Spike, and Fluttershy arrive in the Dragon Lands, Spike thinks of several ways to cheer up Smolder's brother, but Smolder says simply accepting him for who he is will help a great deal, and Spike looks forward to meeting him. While Smolder goes to find her brother and Spike knits a comfort blanket for him, Fluttershy goes to see the dragon eggs. At the egg-hatching grounds, she meets with Dragon Lord Ember, who explains that the eggs are mysteriously not hatching. Fluttershy offers to help her figure out the cause and welcome the baby dragons into the world when they hatch.\nWhen Spike finishes knitting the blanket for Smolder's brother, Garble and his teenage dragon friends arrive. As always, the older, taller dragons tease Spike for his diminutive size and pony-like sensitivity, burning the blanket in the process with their laughter-induced fire breath. When Smolder returns and greets Garble with a special handshake, she reveals that Garble is her brother, much to Spike's shock. According to Garble's friends, Garble has been hiding and moping around ever since Smolder left for school, but Garble vehemently denies this.\n When Garble starts pushing Spike around, Smolder warns him not to give Spike a hard time, mentioning that Spike came to the Dragon Lands to hang out with him. At Smolder's insistence and much to his annoyance, Garble agrees to let Spike tag along, earning him ridicule from his friends. As Garble heads to the lava pit, Spike expresses his confusion at Smolder referring to her brother as \"sweet\" and \"sensitive\" earlier. Smolder explains that Garble's tough-guy persona is just a front he puts on for his friends, comparing him to a burnt marshmallow: smoky on the outside, but soft and sweet on the inside.\n Smolder, Spike, and Garble take part in both Dragon Lands activities and pony-like activities together, including lava diving, tea parties, flying, and sharing circles. Throughout each activity, however, Garble torments Spike and rejects his offerings of friendship. Back at the egg-hatching grounds, Fluttershy tries to get the eggs to hatch by reading them stories. But the only change in their behavior is that they start shaking, which Ember mentions they have been doing for days with no explanation.\nSome time later, Garble's friends redirect some of the Dragon Lands' lava to make a spot for lava surfing. As Garble and Smolder go surfing, Spike stays behind, miserable from all of Garble's torment. Fluttershy appears to explain the situation with the dragon eggs, and Spike reveals to her that Garble is Smolder's brother and all of his attempts to cheer him up have failed.\n When Garble and his friends harass Spike by throwing balls of lava at him, Fluttershy angrily tells them to stop and reminds them that Spike came to the Dragon Lands to cheer up Garble, earning Garble even more ridicule from his friends. As Garble and his friends go lava surfing with Smolder, Spike decides to trade tasks with Fluttershy: she tries to cheer up Garble, while he goes to try and help with the dragon eggs.\n Back at the egg-hatching grounds, Ember tries to get the eggs to hatch with pony-like affection, but they continue to do nothing but shake. When Spike appears and feels the ground underneath the eggs, he realizes it is cold, even though there is supposed to be an underground lava lake heating the ground.\nThey discover that Garble's friends have been redirecting lava from the underground lake to use for lava surfing and hot baths. Ember furiously orders the teenage dragons to direct the lava back, but it is too difficult for them. Spike suggests moving the eggs somewhere warmer, but Ember says they are too fragile to move safely. She tells Garble's friends to gather all the dragons to the hatching grounds so they can heat the ground themselves.\n Meanwhile, Fluttershy searches for Garble and is drawn to the sound of bongo drums. Much to her surprise, she finds Garble reciting beat poetry for Smolder in private. After Garble's initial anger at being caught, he and Smolder explain to Fluttershy that Garble is secretly a beat poet who expresses himself through his rhymes, performing exclusively for Smolder and keeping it hidden from his friends for fear of being mocked. However, ever since Smolder left for school, Garble has been creatively repressed, and he picks on Spike to avoid being picked on himself.\nFluttershy dismisses Garble's claims that Spike is weak, arguing that his courage to be who he is regardless of what anyone else thinks makes him stronger than Garble. Just then, Spike appears to summon Smolder and Garble to the hatching grounds.\n At the egg-hatching grounds, Ember has every dragon in the Dragon Lands warming up the eggs with their fire breath, but the eggs still do not hatch. When Garble's friends make fun of Spike some more, their laughter-induced fire breath burns hotter than normal fire, giving Garble an idea. He grabs his bongo drums and starts reciting his beat poetry in front of the other dragons. When the dragons laugh at him, their fire breath burns hotter than before, warming the dragon eggs enough to make them hatch.\nBefore Garble's friends can make fun of him for being a poet, Ember speaks out on his behalf, declaring him a hero. Smolder says her friends and school teachers have taught her to celebrate the differences of others, not mock them. Ember agrees with this sentiment, and as she and some of the other dragons ask Garble for poetry-writing tips, Fluttershy smothers the newborn baby dragons with love.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins at Sweet Apple Acres, where Applejack and her family are preparing for the \"Confluence\", a rare apple-harvesting event in which all the apples in the orchard turn ripe at the same time. In preparation for this event, Big McIntosh stayed up late the night before making an apple-bucking map and schedule so that they do not miss a single tree. Granny Smith has also recruited Goldie Delicious to help with the days-long harvest.\nGoldie mentions that, for the harvest, the Apples could use the help of the Great Seedling, a magical Earth spirit that grants a bountiful, perpetual harvest to those who catch it. Applejack has long since dismissed the Great Seedling as myth, and she believes Apple Bloom to have also outgrown the legend. But Apple Bloom's interest is instantly rekindled, and she believes she is now old enough to finally catch the creature.\n Applejack is unsure about Apple Bloom wasting valuable harvesting time chasing a legend, but Apple Bloom thinks the Great Seedling can be of great help during the Confluence. Granny Smith and Goldie Delicious assure Applejack that they and Big Mac can handle the harvest themselves while Apple Bloom goes off on her own and has some fun. Taking their words to heart, Applejack drags the sleep-deprived Big Mac along with her to get to work. While bucking apples, Applejack and Big Mac notice Goldie having difficulty with her share of the apple-bucking duties due to her elderly age. Applejack advises Big Mac to revise the schedule he made, especially with Apple Bloom off hunting and setting traps for the Great Seedling.\nThe next morning, Applejack tries to get everyone back on schedule to make up for the previous day's loss of work, but Big Mac is even more sleep-deprived from making a new harvesting schedule, and Apple Bloom just wants to see if the Great Seedling was caught in any of her traps. Much to everyone's shock, strange patterns made of apples cover the field, and Apple Bloom believes they are tracks that the Great Seedling left. As Granny and Goldie keep encouraging Apple Bloom, Applejack accuses them of making the tracks themselves and giving Apple Bloom false hope, but they deny it.\n Applejack approaches Apple Bloom in the barn afterward and tries to convince her that the Great Seedling might not be real, explaining that the legend was used in order to make harvesting time fun for young foals. However, Apple Bloom is convinced that it is real, and she remains determined in her goal to capture it. Applejack makes a deal with Apple Bloom: if she helps with the harvest during the day, Applejack will help her set traps for the Great Seedling during the evening.\n While harvesting apples, Applejack tries to offer more rational explanations for the \"tracks\" left by the Great Seedling, but Granny recalls a time when Applejack was young and also obsessed with finding and catching the creature. During the last Confluence, Bright Mac, Pear Butter, Big Mac, and Granny Smith were harvesting apples while Applejack was setting traps for the Great Seedling. When she fell into one of her own traps, she was stuck in it all day and missed out on helping with the harvest. From then on, she gave up trying to catch the Great Seedling and focused all her energy on hard work and responsibility.\nApple Bloom sympathizes with Applejack for suffering such embarrassment, and with the promise of getting everything done twice as fast, the two work closely together to harvest apples and set traps for the Great Seedling. Little by little, Applejack starts to enjoy herself, having forgotten how much fun setting traps could be, and she and Apple Bloom look forward to checking the traps the next day, with Apple Bloom once again promising to help with the harvest even if the traps are all empty.\n The next morning, Applejack and Apple Bloom discover even more tracks left behind by the Great Seedling, and every trap they set has been sprung with nothing caught in them. Her rational explanations disproven, Applejack starts to believe that the Great Seedling is indeed real. Excited to finally catch the creature, Applejack decides to set even more traps with Apple Bloom while the still sleep-deprived Big Mac begrudgingly covers their portion of the harvesting duties.\n Toward the end of the day's harvesting, Applejack and Big Mac discover that some of the trees they were scheduled to harvest apples from have already been picked clean. Goldie Delicious explains that this is yet another sign of the Great Seedling\u2014the closer it gets to being caught, the more mischievous it gets in order to throw its pursuers off its trail. This gives Applejack the idea of staking out the trees that have not been bucked yet and catching the Great Seedling off-guard.\nThat night, Applejack and Apple Bloom stay up and hide in the trees in anticipation of the Great Seedling's arrival, with Applejack remarking that this is the first time she has gone on a Seedling hunt with her little sister. Though they eventually doze off to sleep, they are woken by the presumed sound of a trap being sprung, and they set out to catch the elusive creature. During their hunt, however, they come to believe that the Great Seedling is hunting them.\n Applejack and Apple Bloom flee from the Great Seedling, and it appears to chase after them. When the creature corners Applejack and Apple Bloom outside the barn, it is revealed to be Big McIntosh, who has been sleepwalking and bucking apples for the past several nights due to his sleep-deprived state.\n The next morning, the Apple family successfully brings in the entire harvest\u2014well ahead of schedule thanks to Big Mac apple-bucking in his sleep. Apple Bloom is disappointed that they did not catch the Great Seedling before she truly outgrows the legend, but Applejack says having fun with friends and family is something one never outgrows.\nJust before Goldie Delicious departs for home, she notices tracks of carrots similar to the Great Seedling's tracks of apples, even though the Apple family was not harvesting the carrots. Realizing the Great Seedling may still be nearby, Applejack and Apple Bloom decide to go on another hunt.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins on a hilltop near Ponyville; Trixie puts together a picnic for herself and Starlight Glimmer as a way for Starlight to relax from her hard work as guidance counselor at the School of Friendship. Though Starlight is touched by Trixie's gesture, she is frequently pulled away by a hoof bracelet she magically enchanted to glow whenever someone knocks on her office door at the school. Trixie is frustrated from Starlight being called away to her office so often, preventing them from spending much time together.\nLater, in her office, Starlight helps Silverstream not only with an upcoming visit by her relatives from Seaquestria but also her research assignment on dangerous creatures of the Everfree Forest. As Starlight quickly wraps up her session with Silverstream, Trixie enters the office ahead of the next student in line to remind Starlight about the party Maud Pie and Mudbriar are throwing for the spring solstice. However, Starlight is very preoccupied with seeing all the students who wish to see her before they leave for spring break.\n Starlight and Trixie head into town to complete a to-do list for Maud and Mudbriar's party, including learning a special cake recipe from Mrs. Cake together. Starlight suggests they split the party-planning duties to save time, but she is so split between helping Trixie and helping her students that she is unable to properly focus on either task. As it starts to get late in the day, Starlight finally goes to Sugarcube Corner to learn Mrs. Cake's special cake recipe with Trixie, but Mrs. Cake says she already taught the recipe to Trixie, much to Starlight's sad disappointment. Upon returning to her office, Starlight finds Trixie waiting for her and apologizes for neglecting their friendship all day. When Silverstream enters with yet another problem to talk with Starlight about, Starlight decides not to ignore her friends anymore. She declares the counselor's office closed and tells Silverstream to go home for spring break and figure her problem out on her own.\nLater that evening, Starlight and Trixie go to Maud and Mudbriar's solstice party, held in Maud's cavern home and with Sunburst also in attendance. With the School of Friendship closed for spring break, Trixie looks forward to finally being able to spend time with Starlight without interruption. Unfortunately, Silverstream's younger brother Terramar suddenly arrives in a panic and informs Starlight that Silverstream never arrived home when expected. With their parents leading search parties between Ponyville and Mount Aris, Terramar has come to check the school.\n When Trixie mentions that Starlight dismissed Silverstream from her office shortly before she went missing, Terramar criticizes Starlight's ability as a counselor. Despite Trixie standing up for her, Starlight feels responsible for causing Silverstream to go missing and offers to help Terramar look for her. Their search around the school leads them to Silverstream's dorm room, where she had been researching cockatrices for her research assignment, and they theorize she went into the Everfree Forest to look for the creatures. Outside the school, Starlight and Terramar meet up with Trixie, Sunburst, Maud, and Mudbriar, who have put the solstice party aside to help with the search. When Starlight mentions that Silverstream possibly went into the Everfree Forest to look for cockatrices, Trixie leads the search party into the forest, but she quickly gets the group lost and going around in circles. Using Silverstream's research notes and Mudbriar's knowledge of shade trees, the group eventually finds an entire colony of cockatrices in the middle of a mass migration, but Silverstream is nowhere to be found.\nWhen the cockatrices discover their presence and attack, the group splits up and keeps their eyes covered to avoid being turned to stone. Starlight teleports her friends to safety one-by-one, but Mudbriar gets turned to stone. When the cockatrices chase them, they flee toward the Castle of the Two Sisters. Upon taking shelter inside the castle doors, the group worries about Silverstream and her still-unknown whereabouts, and Starlight feels even more responsible for her going missing.\n Just then, Trixie notices the crystal treehouse that the Young Six grew from the Tree of Harmony's remains. Inside the treehouse, the group finds Silverstream finishing her research project with the help of a cockatrice named Edith. Having taken Starlight's advice from earlier, Silverstream wanted to finish her assignment before going home for spring break, and she apologizes for causing everyone to worry. Back at Maud's home, Mudbriar is turned back to normal, and Terramar thanks Starlight for helping find Silverstream. Starlight still feels like she abandoned Silverstream and failed in her duties as counselor, but her friends tell her that she cannot completely devote herself to her students or else she risks neglecting her friends (and vice-versa). Starlight decides to set a schedule for students to see her at specific times during the day, and Silverstream agrees to only see Starlight for truly important matters.\nWith that, Starlight and her friends go back to celebrating Maud's spring solstice party.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Skeedaddle racing through Ponyville to find the Cutie Mark Crusaders. He finds them at Scootaloo's house and announces that he finally got his cutie mark in knot-tying.

Lofty in particular mentions that she needs help thinking of a theme for the quilt she is sewing.\nAs Holiday and Lofty leave to catch their train home, Apple Bloom mentions how cool it is that Scootaloo's aunts periodically watch over her while her parents are away. Just then, the mail delivery pony delivers a postcard on Scootaloo's doorstep, and Scootaloo is overjoyed upon reading it.\n Later that day, during Cheerilee's class at the Ponyville Schoolhouse, Scootaloo constantly looks out the door and window for her parents' impending arrival. When Cheerilee moves the lesson on to show-and-tell, Scootaloo excitedly tells her classmates about her parents, explaining that they are world travelers/adventurers who study exotic plants and creatures for the advancement of science and medicine.\nAs Snips doubts Scootaloo's fanciful tales about her parents, a cragadile suddenly bursts into the classroom and menaces Cheerilee and the students. An Earth pony stallion and Pegasus mare enter after the cragadile and wrangle it back into its cage, and Scootaloo introduces the two as her parents Snap Shutter and Mane Allgood. After an early class dismissal, Scootaloo and her parents have a warm reunion, and they and the other Crusaders celebrate this reunion over ice cream sundaes.\n At a local dessert shoppe, Scootaloo catches Snap and Mane up on everything she and her friends have accomplished lately, including becoming friendship tutors at Twilight Sparkle's School of Friendship. Snap and Mane announce that they have taken on a new job assignment that would allow them and Scootaloo to live together, having decided upon this after the recent return of King Sombra and the destruction of the Tree of Harmony. Scootaloo is ecstatic by this announcement until Snap and Mane reveal that their new home is in the distant land of Shire Lanka, with only limited travel to and from Ponyville. The Crusaders are horrified to realize this means the potential and permanent breakup of their group.\n At the Crusaders' clubhouse, the fillies despair over Scootaloo moving away until Rainbow Dash enters offering tickets to a Wonderbolts show. When the Crusaders inform Rainbow about what is going on, she encourages them to come up with a solution like they always do. Reasoning that Scootaloo's parents are only relocating to Shire Lanka because of the rare and dangerous creatures they might discover, the Crusaders come up with the idea of making up such a creature that would get Scootaloo's parents to stay in Ponyville.\nScootaloo lures her parents to the Everfree Forest and tells them about the mysterious \"banshee beast\" that lives there. As Snap and Mane track the creature by its footprints, Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle dress up in a banshee beast costume for Snap and Mane to take a picture of. Unfortunately, in their escape from Snap and Mane, Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle trip and fall out of costume and accidentally reveal their ruse.\nFor their next idea, the Crusaders use photographs of their matching cutie marks to try and convince Snap Shutter that they are an inseparable trio, united forever by the same cutie mark. Snap argues, however, that their cutie marks have certain distinguishing attributes and are not exactly the same. The Crusaders' next idea involves using a magic potion to bind each of their hooves together so they cannot be physically separated, but they quickly reconsider this idea.\n With one day left before Scootaloo and her parents move away, the Crusaders make a last-ditch attempt to get Scootaloo's parents to stay in Ponyville: chaining themselves to the \"For Sale\" sign outside Scootaloo's house. Unfortunately, this also proves to be in vain, and the house ultimately ends up being sold. Snap and Mane express their sympathies to Scootaloo over the difficulty of facing such a big change and allow her to spend her last night in Ponyville with Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle so they can say goodbye. However, Scootaloo angrily and sorrowfully says she does not want to say goodbye, criticizing her parents for changing her whole life so suddenly without taking her feelings into account, and she runs off in tears.\n At the Ponyville train station, Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle find Scootaloo, who has decided to stay with her aunts so that her parents will be forced to go to Shire Lanka without her. Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle accompany her to Holiday and Lofty's house a few train stops away from Ponyville, where Lofty unveils her Cutie Mark Crusader-themed quilt, having been inspired by the Crusaders' stories about all the ponies they have helped.\nThe Crusaders explain to Holiday and Lofty the situation with Scootaloo's parents. When Scootaloo mentions that her parents' jobs are too important for them to stay in Ponyville, Apple Bloom realizes that the Crusaders themselves also have the important and unique job of helping other ponies find their true purpose, which they cannot do if they are separated, and they decide to try and convince Scootaloo's parents of this.\n The next day, Scootaloo brings her parents to Ponyville Town Hall, where a large crowd of ponies have gathered for \"Cutie Mark Crusader Appreciation Day\". Among those assembled are all the ponies and creatures the Crusaders have helped or whose lives they impacted, including Babs Seed, Diamond Tiara, Trouble Shoes, Gabby, Zipporwhill, Tender Taps, Feather Bangs, Petunia Paleo, Chipcutter, Bluenote, Terramar, Big McIntosh, Sugar Belle, Bulk Biceps, Pipsqueak and the former blank flanks of their Cutie Mark Day Camp.\nMayor Mare gives a speech honoring the Cutie Mark Crusaders for everything they do for the ponies of Equestria and awards them a three-handled Key to the City. Others such as Skeedaddle, Rainbow Dash, Holiday, and Lofty also speak out on the Crusaders' behalf, explaining that they have a special purpose that only they can do.\n As the train bound for Shire Lanka is moments away from departing, Snap Shutter and Mane Allgood are seemingly undeterred in their decision to make Scootaloo come with them. However, after hearing everything that has been said, they realize their mistake in trying to take Scootaloo away from her purpose in life and decide to let her stay in Ponyville, much to her joy.\nBecause of how much the Crusaders have improved the lives of the ponies in Ponyville, Holiday and Lofty decide to buy back the house and move to Ponyville so that Scootaloo can live with them permanently.

Before Twilight Sparkle can teleport the giant turtle somewhere else, Princess Celestia and Princess Luna appear to step in and take over, attacking the creature a few times before teleporting it.\nAfter helping Star Swirl the Bearded protect Ponyville during King Sombra's return, Celestia and Luna have come to enjoy being part of the action and making a difference in ponies' lives from outside the throne room. As a result, they go overboard helping ponies with the simplest of tasks, such as fixing a broken bridge, helping a lost Filly Guides troop, and making cupcakes for Cheerilee's class of foals.\n The Mane Six meet at the Castle of Friendship to discuss Celestia and Luna, who seem so overeager to help others that ponies cannot do anything on their own without the princesses intervening. Twilight fears that Celestia and Luna have changed their minds about retiring and do not believe the Mane Six are capable of taking their places as rulers of Equestria. When Celestia and Luna burst in seeking even more action, the ponies tell them that there are plenty of fun things to do aside from trying to be heroes.\nPinkie Pie suggests that Celestia and Luna make a \"bucket list\" of all the things they ever wanted to try but never had the chance to. When Celestia has doubts about leaving the castle unsupervised, Twilight offers to have her and her friends cover for them as practice for when the princesses finally retire.\n At Canterlot Castle, Celestia and Luna excitedly prepare for their impending vacation, but while Celestia craves adventure and excitement, Luna wishes for some relaxation from her dream-watching duties. They decide to take turns doing what they each wish to do during their \"sister trip\" in order to accommodate both of their desires.\nJust before the princesses leave on their vacation, Celestia and Luna gives Twilight and her friends instructions for an upcoming ceremony called the \"Royal Swanifying\", a celebration and party in honor of all the swans in the royal castle lake. They also entrust Twilight with the task of raising the sun and moon in their absence and give her an amulet imbued with a small portion of their magic to help her with this task. Twilight is particularly determined to show Celestia and Luna that she and her friends can handle whatever the princesses' job requires.\n Celestia and Luna set off from Canterlot on their vacation, and through the song Lotta Little Things, they indulge in various activities that they have always wanted to do, including sightseeing, riding rollercoasters, and seeing stage and magic shows. However, while Celestia enjoys the more exciting and thrill-seeking activities, Luna prefers the slower and more relaxing ones. Back at Canterlot Castle, Fancy Pants, Jet Set, and Upper Crust enter the throne room and discover that the Mane Six have assumed Celestia and Luna's duties for the day. As the heads of the Royal Swanifying Committee, the three aristocrats offer their services to help with the Swanifying ceremony, but Twilight declines their offer. As the offended upper-class ponies take their leave, Twilight tells her friends that accepting help would be the same as admitting they cannot handle Celestia and Luna's jobs on their own.\nMeanwhile, Celestia and Luna continue to work through their bucket list, partaking in activities that one of them greatly enjoys and the other does not\u2014zip-lining, cave spelunking, skydiving, and mountain climbing for Celestia, and going to the post office, getting a makeover, and visiting an art museum for Luna. Their disagreement gets so heated that they finally voice their discontent toward each other during a picnic.\n Luna accuses Celestia of always wanting things to be her way, going so far as to suggest she wishes Luna was still trapped in the moon so that she could rule Equestria by herself. Celestia argues, however, that Luna refuses to be happy and that she faces the constant pressure of being responsible for both Equestria and her little sister. When the two sisters get so upset that they use the Royal Canterlot Voice on each other, they decide to go their separate ways and enjoy the rest of their vacation alone. Twilight and her friends struggle to get everything ready for the Swanifying ceremony, and Fancy Pants barges in at various points to voice his concerns and criticisms. Little by little, Twilight and her friends get overwhelmed with all the ceremony-planning duties that continue to pile up. When she wonders how Celestia and Luna handle all of these tasks each year on top of ruling the kingdom, Fancy Pants reveals that the princesses never do all the ceremony planning by themselves, which is why they appoint committees.\n At Fancy Pants' suggestion, the Mane Six entrust the individual ceremony-planning duties to members of Celestia and Luna's royal committees. Rainbow Dash tells Upper Crust to prepare the food, Rarity tells Jet Set to retrieve party decorations, and Fluttershy tells Fleur de Lis to handle ponies at the castle gates waiting to get inside.

On a sunny beach without Celestia, Luna finally gets to relax like she wanted. However, when she sees other sister pairs having fun together on the beach, she starts to get lonely and ends up getting severely sunburned. Meanwhile, Celestia goes skydiving and exploring in a forest, but she gets lost without Luna's better sense of direction and frightened by animals that Luna would usually scare away.\nThe two sisters accidentally cross paths while climbing Mount Filly-mane-jaro, Luna wishing to see the sunrise and Celestia wishing to see the moonset. Despite their earlier argument, they agree to climb the mountain together. At the top of the mountain, they watch the sunrise and moonset side-by-side. Celestia and Luna admit to each other that, for all the grief they give one another, each of them cannot bear living without the other, and they apologize for the harsh words they said.\n At the scheduled time for the moon to set and the sun to rise, Celestia and Luna notice the sun and moon moving wildly and uncontrollably in the sky and quickly realize that Twilight is having trouble with the sun/moon amulet they gave her.

In addition to looking forward to seeing Cheese again, Pinkie also hopes he can help her discover her life's purpose. With the rest of her friends finding their own calling and realizing their own dreams, Pinkie Pie feels unfulfilled and sees Cheese's invitation as an opportunity to figure out her true purpose in life.\nAt Cheese Sandwich's Amusement Factory, Pinkie is stopped at the gates by two security guards, but they grant her entry upon realizing Cheese personally invited her. She is greeted at the entrance by what appears to be Cheese at first but turns out to be his straight-faced vice-president Sans Smirk in a mask. Sans welcomes Pinkie into the factory, where the employees work in boring assembly lines and take a serious approach to the \"science of comedy\".\n Pinkie provides suggestions for improving the factory's gag products, and Sans is impressed by her innovative comedic insight. When Sans brings Pinkie to Cheese's office, she finds him sitting in the dark and speaking with an overly serious tone of voice. Cheese reveals that the true reason he invited Pinkie to his factory is because he has lost his ability to laugh and needs her help getting it back. Cheese says to Pinkie that he can still tell if a joke or gag is funny or not, but he is unable to laugh at them, resulting in a creative block that prevents him from coming up with new ones. He explains that his travels across Equestria as a party pony had been very profitable, but his work eventually became more than he could handle. Sans Smirk appeared before him with the idea of opening a factory to keep up with the rising demand. But even with the factory's great success, Cheese inexplicably lost his laugh some time later, and he has stayed inside the factory ever since out of shame.\n Realizing Cheese's crisis, Pinkie vows to help him get his laugh back. With Sans Smirk's assistance and the factory's entire inventory, she tries to get Cheese to laugh with various gags, props, and comedy styles, including googly-eye glasses, shock buzzers, and pie-in-the-face pratfalls. Unfortunately, all of her efforts result in failure. Still incapable of laughing, Cheese thanks Pinkie for trying so hard and resigns himself of a life devoid of laughter. With Cheese Sandwich unable to laugh or come up with any new jokes or gags, Sans Smirk is unsure how long he and the other factory workers can recycle Cheese's old ones before the factory goes out of business. Sans offers to let Pinkie Pie take over the factory in Cheese's place, but Pinkie does not believe that is her life's purpose, wanting to make ponies happy in real-time. When Sans mentions how happy Cheese was to see the joy his gags brought to ponies' faces in the factory's early days, Pinkie comes up with an idea.\nPinkie Pie races to Cheese's office and reveals to him the reason for his loss of laughter. Even though his factory brings joy to ponies around Equestria, he cannot be satisfied unless he witnesses that joy face-to-face, which he cannot do from behind the factory walls. Pinkie tests her theory by having Cheese tell a joke to Sans Smirk. Though Sans does not laugh, Cheese's humor and unintentional spoonerisms cause some of the factory workers to.\n Through the titular song The Last Laugh, Cheese rediscovers the joy of bringing laughter to ponies directly instead of through a factory. Near the end of the song, he even manages to get the perpetually poker-faced Sans Smirk to laugh. Deciding to be a traveling party pony again, Cheese steps down as factory president and appoints Sans Smirk as his replacement, saying he will send whatever new gag ideas he comes up with to the factory during his travels. With his own life's purpose reaffirmed, Cheese invites Pinkie to accompany him so they can figure out hers, but Pinkie declines.\n Pinkie Pie returns to Ponyville and tells her friends about her experiences at Cheese Sandwich's factory.

When they demonstrates the routine they have been working on, Yona's stomping throws off Shimmy Shake and Lighthoof's rhythm, Smolder shows no enthusiasm for cheering, and Ocellus' cheers are too quiet.\nThe squad looks to Rainbow Dash for guidance and improvement, but Rainbow shows very little interest in being a cheerleading coach, as she would rather coach an actual team. When she leaves, Snips catches up with her and tries to convince her to coach the squad properly\u2014mainly so he can make a profit from selling buckball souvenirs. However, Rainbow still refuses to coach, dismissing cheerleading in sports as unimportant, and tells Snips to coach the squad himself.\n Back on the field, Rainbow Dash observes Snails' bizarre coaching practice with the buckball team. When the cheer squad appears after a failed practice session with Snips, Smolder tells Rainbow to do what Twilight told her to do, but Rainbow continues to shirk responsibility and have others coach the squad for her. Snails, in a rare moment of wisdom, advises Rainbow Dash to look to her friends for help, and Rainbow begrudgingly acquiesces. Following Snails' advice, Rainbow Dash goes to her friends for help in coaching the cheer squad. Pinkie Pie provides a party cannon, Rarity provides brand-new cheerleading uniforms, Applejack and Big McIntosh provide bales of hay, and Rainbow herself brings a rhyming dictionary from the school library. She tries again to leave, but the squad tells her that Fluttershy and Pinkie want them to debut their new cheer routine the next day in order to get the team excited for the upcoming game. However, Rainbow tells the squad to figure things out for themselves.\n The next day, Rainbow Dash continues to watch Fluttershy and Pinkie coach the buckball team. When the cheer squad appears to debut their new routine, it is just as clumsy and uncoordinated as when they first started due to Rainbow's overall lack of direction. Later inside the school, Rainbow's continued dismissal of cheerleading upsets Yona to tears and causes Shimmy Shake, Lighthoof, and Ocellus to quit the squad. Smolder angrily chastises Rainbow for not giving coaching a proper effort, mentioning that she was excited to be on the squad when she learned Rainbow was going to be the coach.\n Realizing what a poor coach she has been, Rainbow Dash comes up with an idea to fix things. She has Snips gather the squad on the buckball field, where Rainbow Dash apologizes and says even though she does not care about cheerleading, the squad does, and Rainbow cares about the squad. To that end, she resolves to help them improve their routine. With Rainbow's guidance, Yona learns to stomp in time with Shimmy Shake and Lighthoof's dancing, Ocellus cheers more loudly with a megaphone, and Smolder adds just the right amount of smoke effects with her smoke breath.\n On the day of the buckball game between Twilight and Celestia's schools, Rainbow Dash is just as nervous to see the results of her coaching efforts as Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie are. The cheer squad debuts their new and improved cheering routine during halftime, and thanks to Rainbow's help, it is successful and met with great applause from the crowd. Though Twilight's team ultimately loses to Celestia's team, Rainbow Dash is immensely proud of the cheer squad.\nTwilight feels vindicated in that she was right all along about Rainbow being the perfect pony to coach the squad, and she conveys the lesson that Rainbow does not have to care about something that other ponies like as long as she cares about the ponies who like it.\n"}, {"summary": " At the Castle of Friendship, Twilight Sparkle is so excited for Trivia Trot\u2014a competitive game of trivia questions and answers\u2014the next day, as well as the thought of her third consecutive Trivia Trot victory, that she only communicates with Spike in the form of trivia answers in order to \"stay in the zone\". The next day, Spike accompanies Twilight to the Hay Burger restaurant where Trivia Trot is being held, and Twilight goes into extensive detail on the game's rules.\nInside the restaurant, multiple ponies have appeared to participate in Trivia Trot, some of whom are long-time participants\u2014including Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Sunburst, Fluttershy, Maud Pie, and Mudbriar\u2014and Twilight has compiled data on each of their trivia strengths and weaknesses in anticipation of being partnered with one of them. However, Pinkie Pie, who has never participated before, also shows up to participate, causing Twilight to panic at the possibility of being partnered with her and her Trivia Trot winning streak being jeopardized.\n Trivia Trot hostess Granny Smith selects the game's teams\u2014Sunburst with Cranky Doodle Donkey, Applejack with Dr. Hooves, Rainbow Dash with Matilda, Fluttershy with Bulk Biceps, and Maud Pie with Mudbriar\u2014leaving Twilight to be paired with Pinkie Pie. Despite Twilight's concerns about her winning streak, Pinkie is happy and excited just to play as her partner. Spike also volunteers to keep score during the game. As the game gets underway, Pinkie Pie immediately starts giving incorrect answers, causing her and Twilight to fall to last place. Twilight tries her best to pick up the slack, but Pinkie serves as a constant distraction with her fidgeting, growling stomach, and overall inattentiveness. During the snacks/bathroom break, Twilight confides in Spike that Pinkie is holding her back from getting her third consecutive win, but she does not want to hurt Pinkie's feelings.\nSpike suggests that Twilight focus on herself rather than Pinkie, but Twilight decides to focus on the other teams instead. When the game resumes, Twilight focuses less on answering questions and more on getting the other teams deducted points or penalized for breaking the rules. As a result of Twilight's strict enforcement of the rules, Sunburst is disqualified from the game when Cranky is caught sleeping. In addition, she refuses to let Pinkie attempt to answer any questions, even those Pinkie knows the answers to.\n As the game progresses, Twilight perceives Pinkie Pie as more and more of a hindrance to her winning the game, and she sees the much more knowledgeable Sunburst as a potential replacement. Twilight tricks Pinkie into breaking the rules and getting herself disqualified from the game. With both of their teammates disqualified, Twilight and Sunburst form a new team together, much to Pinkie's disappointment. Noticing Twilight's frazzled state, Sunburst takes over answering all the following questions and refuses to let Twilight answer any, just like how Twilight treated Pinkie Pie earlier. This causes tension between the two, and Sunburst\u2014not wanting to let his correct-answer percentage drop any lower\u2014tries to trick Twilight into getting herself disqualified. Twilight quickly catches on, however, and chastises Sunburst for trying to trick her. When Sunburst apologizes for the deception, Twilight feels guilty for doing the same thing to Pinkie.\n As Sunburst teams up again with the now awake Cranky Doodle, Twilight apologizes to Pinkie Pie for letting her obsession with winning get the best of her. Pinkie adds that even if she did not know the answer to every question, they still could have had fun together. Twilight decides to forget about her third consecutive win and offers to let Pinkie be her partner again, even if it means resetting their current score to zero."}, {"summary": " The episode begins at Grogar's lair, where Grogar explains to Cozy Glow that because she, Chrysalis, and Tirek failed to retrieve his Bewitching Bell from the top of Mt. Everhoof, they must seek out an alternate source of power to destroy Twilight Sparkle and her friends. As Grogar leaves, Cozy, Chrysalis, and Tirek try to figure out how to use the Bewitching Bell, which they secretly did succeed in retrieving, against him.\nWhen they are unable to activate the Bell, Cozy Glow mentions the restricted area of the Canterlot Archives that Twilight once told her about and suggests looking there for information.\n In Canterlot, Twilight is hard at work planning the upcoming Summer Sun Celebration, having learned from recent experiences to delegate her responsibilities and not get stressed out. Princess Celestia and Princess Luna enter and inform her that this might be the last Summer Sun Celebration to be held before they step down from the thrones and hand things over to Twilight and her friends.\nWhen Twilight relays this information to her friends, they fear she will start stressing out like she always does, but she is surprisingly calm and wants to make this last Summer Sun Celebration special. With Discord's arrival, Twilight gives each of her friends one last task to take care of before the Celebration preparations are complete.\n Meanwhile, Cozy Glow, Chrysalis, and Tirek sneak into Canterlot under the cover of night and try to infiltrate the Archives. But they have difficulty doing so due to Shining Armor's new security measures around the castle as well as the presence of the Mane Six, Spike, and Discord. Luckily, Chrysalis comes up with an idea and explains it to her fellow villains. Following Twilight's instructions, Applejack and Pinkie Pie oversee adjustments to the Celebration catering provided by Braeburn and the Earth ponies of Appleloosa. Tirek, hiding in the bushes nearby, absorbs the magic of a few ponies, causing them to become severely weak. Braeburn, whose magic is also drained, believes it to be the result of contaminated food and warns everyone not to eat any until they figure out what is going on. As the ponies evacuate the area, Tirek steals some of the food.\nMeanwhile, Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash meet with the Pegasi from Cloudsdale and their very high-strung coordinator Feather Flatterfly to request changes to the weather. Despite his uncontrollable panic, Flatterfly says he and his team will do their best to fulfill Twilight's wishes. When Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash leave, Cozy Glow approaches Flatterfly and offers to take care of the weather changes for him.\n Lastly, Rarity and Spike meet with the unicorn team in charge of the ceremony's fireworks display, led by Fire Flare, to communicate Twilight's new vision for the fireworks show. When Rarity and Spike leave, Chrysalis disguises herself as a pony named Crackle Cosette and convinces the troupe that unicorns are superior to Earth ponies and Pegasi and that fireworks shows are a waste of their magical talent. Back in the castle, Twilight thanks her friends for their help in organizing the Summer Sun Celebration. Celestia and Luna, remembering that Twilight had difficulty raising the sun and moon once before, offer to help her practice using the amulet imbued with their magic. Just as Twilight leaves the room with Celestia and Luna, Braeburn appears to inform Twilight's friends that some of the catered food has gone missing and the Earth ponies are too weak to make more.\nThen, a royal guard appears and alerts them about sudden hazardous weather patterns. Finally, Fire Flare and her unicorn troupe appear and quit the fireworks show, believing unicorns are too good for such trivial performances. As a result of Tirek, Cozy, and Chrysalis' schemes, the Summer Sun Celebration preparations devolve into complete chaos. In order to keep Twilight from getting stressed out, her friends decide to try and fix everything before the Celebration begins.\n Applejack and Pinkie Pie tend to the weak Earth ponies, but they determine that the food is not the cause of their sudden sickness. Rainbow Dash and the Wonderbolts race to get the hazardous weather under control, and Rarity and Spike try to convince Fire Flare and her team to put on the fireworks show. Meanwhile, Cozy Glow, Tirek, and Chrysalis take advantage of the chaos to incapacitate a royal guard, infiltrate the castle, sneak past the patrol of geese, and break into the Archives. Despite her friends' efforts to keep it a secret from her, Twilight eventually discovers the chaotic state of the ceremony preparations. Much to her friends' surprise, Twilight remains perfectly calm and takes charge of the effort to fix everything, with the addition of Celestia and Luna's help. Together, they nurse the weak Earth ponies back to health, clear the sky of hazardous weather conditions, and convince the unicorns to perform.\nIn the end, the Summer Sun Celebration is a huge success. In recognition of how much Celestia and Luna have done for Equestria, Twilight announces a brand new holiday to replace the Summer Sun Celebration: the \"Festival of the Two Sisters\". Twilight's friends apologize for not telling her about the preparations going wrong, and they are proud of her for getting over her tendency to freak out.\n Meanwhile, Cozy Glow, Tirek, and Chrysalis steal a book from the Canterlot Archives. When they return to Grogar's lair, Grogar reveals that he has successfully found a new source of power to defeat Twilight and her friends with and plans to set out the next day to claim it. With the book they stole from the Archives, Cozy, Tirek, and Chrysalis resolve to unlock the power of the Bewitching Bell, and Cozy remarks how easy it was to get the Earth ponies, unicorns, and Pegasi at the Summer Sun Celebration to turn on each other.\n"}, {"summary": " At Fluttershy's Sweet Feather Sanctuary, Fluttershy holds a support group for the animals living there, who are split into two groups of predator and prey. As Fluttershy tries to settle differences between the two sides over what to eat and what not to eat, Angel constantly interrupts the meeting over a desire to be heard.\nAfter an agreement is reached for the predators to only eat vegetables while staying at the sanctuary, Angel antagonizes a wolf named Sandra, causing a large brawl to break out among all the animals in the support group. Dr. Fauna and Zecora arrive with a new animal to welcome into the sanctuary: a gecko that breathes smoke. When Zecora notices Fluttershy and Angel not getting along, she offers to help fix their strained relationship, though Fluttershy insists they get along fine.\n Fluttershy goes through her long to-do list of helping the gecko integrate into the animal community and giving the predator animals alternate food choices so that they leave the prey animals alone. All the while, Angel seeks attention from her and bothers her for petty and selfish reasons and she ignores him. Their disagreement soon comes to a head over Fluttershy neglecting Angel for her many responsibilities and Angel's inability to communicate with anyone except her. Realizing the strain this is causing to their relationship, they decide to see Zecora after all.\n At Zecora's hut, Fluttershy and Angel try to get to the root of their relationship troubles. Fluttershy says Angel constantly distracts her from her duties at the sanctuary and the School of Friendship, and Angel\u2014with Fluttershy serving as his interpreter\u2014says Fluttershy constantly ignores him, despite being the only pony who can understand him. To help them through this, Zecora brews a pair of potions for them to drink and tells them to wait until they are alone at home before doing so.\nOn their way home, Angel is excited to drink Zecora's potions with Fluttershy, wanting to make a tea party out of the occasion. But when Fluttershy worries about her sanctuary duties, Angel gets impatient, immediately drinking one potion and urging Fluttershy to drink the other. When Fluttershy drinks the other potion, the potions' magic causes her and Angel to switch bodies.\n Fluttershy, stressed over this development, desperately wants to switch back so she can finish her sanctuary duties, but Angel refuses as he is finally able to talk with other ponies. Believing this was not the intended effect of Zecora's potion, Fluttershy decides to go back to Zecora's hut and get another potion to turn herself and Angel back to normal. She tells Angel to finish her chores at the sanctuary in the meantime, and when Angel once again refuses, Fluttershy uses the Stare to compel him.\n Back at the Sweet Feather Sanctuary, Angel addresses Fluttershy's long list of chores with complete indifference and terrorizes Sandra the wolf after their earlier scuffle. His overall disinterest in Fluttershy's tasks dissatisfies the sanctuary animals and causes a snake named Antoine to express hungry interest in a baby elephant named Muriel. Meanwhile, Fluttershy makes her way into the Everfree Forest and runs into Twilight Sparkle and Spike. As a result of being stuck in Angel's body, Fluttershy is unable to communicate with her friends, it takes her more time and effort to travel long distances, and the forest predators present a greater danger. Even when she finally reaches Zecora, Fluttershy cannot communicate her and Angel's body-swap dilemma. Zecora, sympathizing that Angel only has one pony in the world he can talk to, suggests that he and Fluttershy apologize to each other.\n As a result of Angel's carelessness in finishing Fluttershy's chores, Antoine the snake devours Muriel the baby elephant whole, and the sanctuary descends into utter chaos, leaving Dr. Fauna completely puzzled by \"Fluttershy\"'s odd behavior. Fluttershy finally makes it to the sanctuary, but the journey leaves her severely exhausted. Dr. Fauna explains that concentrated carrot extract can restore \"Angel\"'s health, but the carrot extract is locked in the sanctuary's supply room, and the keys to the supply room are stuck inside Muriel's trunk.\nAngel turns to the other animals for help, but they refuse after how poorly he took care of them. Angel appeals to their love for Fluttershy and asks them to help for her sake, and they begrudgingly agree. Working together, the animals succeed in liberating Muriel from Antoine's stomach and the supply room keys from Muriel's trunk. With the concentrated carrot extract from the supply room, Angel and Dr. Fauna nurse Fluttershy back to health.\n Angel sympathizes with Fluttershy for the hard work she does in managing the sanctuary and balancing it with her duties as a friendship teacher. Likewise, Fluttershy sympathizes with Angel for how hard it is for him getting from one place to another in such a tiny body. As the two gain a newfound understanding and appreciation for each other, the magic of Zecora's potion returns them to their original bodies. During the next predator/prey support group meeting, Fluttershy promises to always make time for Angel from now on, and Angel offers to help out around the sanctuary every now and then so that Fluttershy does not get overwhelmed with work so often. Meanwhile, Dr. Fauna reveals that the gecko Zecora brought to the sanctuary is actually a fire lizard."}, {"summary": " The episode begins at the Castle of Friendship, where Rarity enters Spike's room and asks him to accompany her to the gem cave as her basket holder/bodyguard.

When Rarity goes looking for Spike at the castle later, Twilight Sparkle says he has gone to the post office again. When Rarity wonders why Spike declined her invitation to the gem cave earlier, Twilight suggests the two of them had some sort of argument that hurt Spike's feelings. Though Rarity cannot remember doing so, she hopes that a simple apology will mend their differences.\n Rarity pushes a giant crate of gifts for Spike to the post office as part of her grand apology to him, and she runs into Griffonstone mail delivery griffon Gabby. When Gabby mentions to her that Spike just recently stepped out, Rarity practices her overdramatic apology with Gabby as Spike's stand-in. As soon as Spike returns, Rarity delivers her apology and begs Spike's forgiveness for whatever she did to upset him, but Spike does not know what she is apologizing for.\nSpike reveals that he declined Rarity's invitation to the gem cave because he already had plans to hang out with Gabby; the two had become pen pals after the events of The Fault in Our Cutie Marks. With Spike spending time with Gabby while she is in town, Rarity invites him to go fabric-shopping with her the next day, but Spike says because Gallus attends the School of Friendship, Gabby is in Ponyville much more often getting updates for Grampa Gruff. As Spike and Gabby fly off to hang out some more, Rarity is left by herself once again.\n The next day, Rarity goes fabric-shopping with Rainbow Dash and uses Fluttershy as an assistant at her boutique, all the while expressing jealousy that Spike is spending all of his time with Gabby. She also comes to realize how invaluable his help is with her shopping and sewing and how much she enjoys his company. Fluttershy suggests that Rarity show Spike how grateful she is for everything he has done for her over the years. Rarity visits Spike in the middle of the night and invites him to go with her to the Great Gem Crevasse of the Crystal Mountains, which is only accessible once a year, as a token of gratitude for everything he does for her.

Twilight Sparkle and Spike enter the office; with Twilight about to take over Celestia and Luna's duties of ruling Equestria, she decides to enact her and Starlight's previously-discussed decision to have Starlight take over as the school's headmare. Though she is somewhat overwhelmed by the decision, Starlight happily accepts her new position.\nLater, Trixie expresses that while she is proud of Starlight and her new position, she worries that the responsibilities that come with it will cut into their social time. Starlight explains that her taking over the school is very important, and she wants to get as much advice from Twilight as possible before Twilight moves to Canterlot. When Trixie brings up the fact that Twilight has always run the school alongside her friends, Starlight gets an idea.\n In Twilight's office, Starlight asks Twilight if she can hire a vice headmare to help her run the school. Twilight gives her full support for the idea and wishes Starlight good luck in this task before leaving for a coronation gown fitting. Trixie, having overheard Starlight and Twilight from outside, believes the position of vice headmare is automatically hers. Starlight tries to convince her that she has to choose a vice headmare through a lengthy selection process, but Trixie assumes this is merely a formality before Starlight inevitably picks her. Some time later, Starlight meets with several applicants for the position of vice headmare, including Trixie, Big McIntosh, Dr. Hooves, Octavia Melody, and Spoiled Rich. She explains to the applicants her three-stage interview process in which they will need to demonstrate the skills that a vice headmare requires. In the first stage, the applicants serve as substitute teachers for the school students. Big Mac, Octavia, and Dr. Hooves all receive the students' approval, but Spoiled Rich and Trixie's classes are met with dissatisfaction and boredom.\nIn her office, Starlight allows Big Mac, Octavia, and Dr. Hooves to move on to the next stage of her interview process, but Spoiled Rich is dismissed. She considers dismissing Trixie as well but decides to give her another chance out of a desire to have a friend be her vice headmare. Trixie suddenly enters and expresses how excited she is for her and Starlight to be working together, causing Starlight to feel even more pressure to keep her on as a potential candidate for vice headmare.\n In the second stage of the interview process, Starlight tests the applicants' communication skills by having them meet with students' parents and guardians for parent/teacher conferences. Octavia and Dr. Hooves pass this stage as well, but Big Mac faces difficulty with his limited communication skills, and Trixie gets into an argument with Grampa Gruff when she sticks up for Gallus. After dismissing Big Mac from the interview process, Starlight admonishes Trixie for getting into an argument with Grampa Gruff and warns her to take things more seriously in the final stage. However, Trixie still believes Starlight will give her the position of vice headmare in the end, despite how well she performs.\n In the final stage of the interview process, Starlight tasks the remaining applicants with organizing field trips for the students. Octavia passes this stage by performing music alongside DJ Pon-3 at the Ponyville Theater, but Dr. Hooves' field trip to his science lab fails to meet the students' expectations. Trixie's idea for a field trip involves teleporting a patch of Froggy Bottom Bogg directly into her classroom, but she accidentally endangers the students by bringing in a hive of flash bees.\nAfter evacuating the students, Starlight teleports the hive away, but the classroom becomes a complete mess. Fed up with Trixie's failure in every stage of her interview process, Starlight angrily chews her out for not taking things seriously and for putting the students in danger, concluding that she will never be right for the job of vice headmare and calling her incompetent. Trixie, heartbroken by Starlight's words, leaves in tears.\n Upon seeing Trixie leave, Twilight enters and magically fixes the damage to the classroom. When Starlight shares how much difficulty she is having in choosing a vice headmare and how much she wants to appoint a friend for the position, Twilight explains that not everyone is right for every job and that if one has a job to do, they will not always be able to work with a friend on it, no matter how much they want to. Starlight realizes her mistake in showing Trixie favoritism throughout the interview process and not being straightforward with her from the start.\n Starlight goes to Trixie at her traveling caravan and apologizes for hurting her feelings and not being straightforward from the beginning that she was not qualified for the position of vice headmare. After Starlight's harsh words earlier, Trixie believes she would be of no help to Starlight in her new job as headmare. However, Starlight argues that Trixie still has something to contribute, having initially motivated Starlight to appoint a vice headmare in the first place and later standing up for Gallus.\nTrixie admits her own mistake in assuming Starlight would give her the job, and with Dr. Hooves and Octavia having withdrawn their own applications, there are no other candidates for vice headmare. Wanting to help Starlight fill the position, Trixie suggests finding someone responsible, detail-oriented, and smart. To that end, she sends a letter to Sunburst. Since he does not have as many responsibilities as Flurry Heart's royal crystaller as he used to, Sunburst eagerly accepts the position of vice headmare at the School of Friendship.\n Starlight thanks Trixie for her consideration of Sunburst for the job. Taking into account Trixie's hidden insightfulness, talent for giving advice, and thoughtful consideration of others, Starlight offers her a position as the school's new student counselor. Trixie accepts the position and immediately starts redecorating the office \u2013 to Starlight's dismay, this involves throwing her plant Phyllis in the garbage."}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Fluttershy returning some Daring Do books that she borrowed from Rainbow Dash, having become another big fan of the book series.

Yearling always sends her advance copies of her books.\nFluttershy lends Rainbow her copy of The Fallen Idol, and Rainbow discovers the book was written by \"Groom Q. Q. Martingale\" from the villain Dr. Caballeron's point of view, portrays Daring Do in a very negative light, and even reveals that Daring Do is a real-life pony. Rainbow Dash is outraged by Martingale's libelous writing, but Fluttershy thinks the book gives valuable insight into Caballeron's perspective. Annoyed that Fluttershy is defending a known villain, Rainbow wants to warn A.K. Yearling before ponies realize she is Daring Do herself and her reputation is harmed further.\n Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy travel to a bookstore where A.K. Yearling is doing a book signing, and a number of readers are harshly criticizing her over the content of Martingale's book. Yearling, having wanted to share the stories of her adventures as Daring Do with the public, is miserable that Martingale is ruining her character. Coincidentally, Martingale is doing a book signing right across the street from Yearling's, and Rainbow and Fluttershy go to confront him. The two discover that \"Groom Q. Q. Martingale\" is Dr. Caballeron in disguise, and Rainbow Dash believes he created the Martingale persona to publish books that portray him as a hero. Rainbow confronts Caballeron about his new scheme to make Daring Do look bad, but Caballeron says he is just sharing his side of Daring Do's story with the public. Rainbow refuses to acknowledge Caballeron's claims, but Fluttershy offers to hear him out.\nCaballeron explains that he and his henchponies unearthed ancient artifacts in order to preserve them in a museum, but Daring Do always intervened, refusing to team up with Caballeron and keeping the artifacts for herself. When Fluttershy mentions Caballeron's past attempt to sell an artifact to the highest bidder, Caballeron reveals he did so because Daring Do's actions caused his museum to go out of business.\n As Fluttershy starts to consider the true consequences of Daring Do's actions, Caballeron thanks her for listening to his side of the story and invites her to accompany him and his team on an expedition to the Tenochtitlan Basin. Fluttershy accepts Caballeron's invitation in order to find out which of the two Daring Do authors is telling the truth, much to Rainbow Dash's shock. Rainbow Dash hurries back to A.K. Yearling and brings her up to speed about what is going on. Yearling believes that Dr. Caballeron is going after the Truth Talisman of Tonatiuh, which cannot be reached without a Pegasus' flight, and that he tricked Fluttershy into joining him in order to obtain it. Discarding her A.K. Yearling disguise, Daring Do joins Rainbow Dash in her quest to stop Caballeron and save Fluttershy.\nDeep in the Tenochtitlan jungle, Caballeron puts on a facade of wanting to preserve the local plant life and protect his henchponies from poisonous fruits for Fluttershy's sake. Fluttershy shares food with her new friends and pacifies the wild jungle cats before they can attack; Caballeron and his henchponies are impressed by Fluttershy's kindness and willingness to listen. Meanwhile, Rainbow Dash and Daring Do race to catch up with them before Caballeron can claim the Truth Talisman for monetary gain.\n Dr. Caballeron and his team reach the temple that houses the Truth Talisman of Tonatiuh. As they attempt to gain entry into the temple, Fluttershy gives Biff positive reenforcement and saves Withers from a swarm of fly-ders. Close behind them, Rainbow Dash and Daring Do run into Ahuizotl, who believes they are also trying to claim the Truth Talisman. Rainbow and Daring escape from Ahuizotl just as Caballeron and his team open the temple entrance, and Rainbow and Daring follow them inside. While Rainbow and Daring Do navigate the temple's labyrinth-like structure, Dr. Caballeron and his team quickly make their way to the chamber of the Truth Talisman of Tonatiuh. Caballeron, over-dramatically playing to Fluttershy's kindness, convinces her to retrieve the Talisman with her flight. When Fluttershy triggers a booby trap and nearly falls into a pit of lava, Caballeron and his henchponies save her.\nJust as Caballeron claims the Truth Talisman for himself, Rainbow Dash and Daring Do appear and demand he relinquish it. Fluttershy tries to convince them that Caballeron and his henchponies simply want to put the Talisman in a museum, but Caballeron is compelled by the magical properties of the Talisman to tell the truth. He reveals that he did indeed trick Fluttershy into joining him at first, but during their time together, he and his henchponies came to value her kindness and friendship.\n Just then, Ahuizotl appears and commands a group of stone gargoyles to attack the temple intruders before trapping them inside the chamber. With Fluttershy's animal communication ineffective against creatures made of stone, Daring Do and Caballeron drive them off with bright light reflected off of a diamond artifact. The ponies all work together to escape the chamber and run into Ahuizotl again. They struggle to keep the Truth Talisman away from him, but he eventually traps them in a narrow dead end. As the ponies wonder how they will escape, Fluttershy decides to reach out to Ahuizotl the same way she reached out to Dr. Caballeron earlier, and she asks him why he is trying to destroy them. Ahuizotl takes the Truth Talisman and, influenced by its magic, explains that he is one of several guardian creatures of Equestria tasked with protecting the artifacts of Tenochtitlan, a task made difficult by Daring Do and Dr. Caballeron's repeated artifact thefts. Daring Do says she only took the artifacts because she believed she was protecting them, and she and Caballeron realize they were wrong about Ahuizotl. Rainbow Dash acknowledges the merits of listening to and trying to understand others, including those perceived to be villains and monsters. As gratitude for the ponies listening to his side of the story and returning the Truth Talisman, Ahuizotl allows them to leave\u2014on the condition that Daring Do and Dr. Caballeron never steal any more artifacts from the Tenochtitlan Basin.\nUpon discovering that Daring Do is A.K. Yearling, Caballeron proposes they co-write her next book. However, when they hold a book signing for it, they are upstaged by a third Daring Do author: Ahuizotl.\n"}, {"summary": " At the Cutie Mark Crusaders' clubhouse, Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo are excited to go to the Appleloosa County Fair and have made meticulous preparations to attend.

Rarity is preoccupied with making a new design for Fancy Pants, Rainbow Dash has to help Spitfire corral some storm clouds, and Applejack is taking care of a sick Big McIntosh.\nWith each pony they ask, the Crusaders are warned not to travel by themselves or else they might get lost, and the responsibilities that come with being adults. At the Castle of Friendship, the Crusaders also ask Fluttershy and Twilight Sparkle, but the two are busy researching an enchanted flower sent by Star Swirl the Bearded. They too warn the Crusaders about the dangers of traveling without a chaperone and the possibility of getting themselves lost in a strange place.\n As Twilight and Fluttershy leave to find information about the flower in the castle library, the Crusaders lament their situation and express their desire to be grown-ups. Reacting to their wishes, the flower sheds one of its last remaining petals and envelops the Crusaders in magical light. When the light subsides, the Crusaders find themselves magically transformed into fully grown mares. Now full-grown adults, the Cutie Mark Crusaders believe they are old enough to travel to Appleloosa by themselves, and they race to catch the Friendship Express before it leaves the train station.

Unfortunately, after boarding the wrong train, they end up at Hayseed Junction instead of Appleloosa.\nFollowing an encounter with a deranged ticket-taking pony, the Crusaders decide to try traversing the dense swamp and reaching Appleloosa on foot, believing being grown-ups is all they need to do so. Unfortunately, they soon get become lost\u2014just as Twilight and her friends previously warned. They then run into a pair of young ponies named Biscuit and Spur, who are arguing whether or not to take their pet Bloofy to the Appleloosa County Fair.\n Once again, the Crusaders believe being adults puts them in a position to give Biscuit and Spur grown-up advice, and they suggest that Biscuit and Spur share Bloofy and bring him to Appleloosa, much to Spur's displeasure. Following behind Biscuit and Spur, the Crusaders finally arrive to the Appleloosa County Fair, where one of the Appleloosan attendants notices Bloofy and suggests that Biscuit enter him in the animals showcase. Spur tries to voice her disagreement with this idea and turns to the grown-up Crusaders for advice, but they run off on their own to enjoy the fair. By the time Spur catches up with the Crusaders again, Biscuit is already signing up Bloofy for the animal showcase. Spur, having taken care of Bloofy longer than Biscuit, is worried about exposing him to a large crowd of ponies, but the Crusaders once again side with Biscuit and suggest that Spur take a break. However, soon after Biscuit and Bloofy begin their turn in the showcase, Bloofy gets nervous from all the spectators watching him, and he turns into a tornado that starts tearing up the showcase stadium.\nTwilight and Fluttershy soon arrive to Appleloosa via train in search of the missing Crusaders, and the fillies-turned-adults appear to inform them of what is going on. At the showcase stadium, Fluttershy identifies the rampaging Bloofy as a rare creature called a Whirling Mungtooth and explains he will only calm down in the presence of its caretaker. Realizing that Spur is Bloofy's true caretaker, the Crusaders go to find her while Twilight and Fluttershy evacuate everyone in the stadium to safety.\n Once the Crusaders bring Spur back to the stadium, Fluttershy helps her calm Bloofy down, and Bloofy still wins the animal showcase award for \"Most Interesting Creature\". Back at the train station, the Crusaders realize that even though they are physically adults, they still lack the wisdom, experience, and maturity that comes with growing up naturally. Using the last remaining petal of the flower Star Swirl sent to Twilight, the Crusaders wish themselves back to filly age.\nBiscuit and Spur are surprised to discover the Crusaders are actually younger than they are. The Crusaders apologize for lying to Biscuit and Spur about their real age and for being selfish, and they ask if they can visit Biscuit, Spur, and Bloofy some day. Spur agrees on the condition that they have a real grown-up accompany them next time.\n"}, {"summary": " The episode begins with Spike, Discord, Mrs. Cake, and the Cutie Mark Crusaders all explaining to an off-screen character about a crisis that recently occurred in Ponyville.

She explains to Spike that, having inherited management of the School for Gifted Unicorns, her top student has failed to learn the most important lesson of all.\n Magic student Luster Dawn enters and tells Twilight that, even though she is very diligent in her magic studies, she is put off by the curriculum's focus on making friends, and sees friendship as a distraction and a waste of time. Even Twilight herself appears to rule Equestria alone, despite all she has accomplished with her friends. Reminded of how she used to be many years earlier, Twilight explains to Luster that friendships can be complicated and messy, and she tells of a time when she also thought it would not last forever. The episode flashes back to the day of Twilight's coronation, soon after the defeat of Queen Chrysalis, Lord Tirek, and Cozy Glow. Twilight and Spike are packing up to move back to Canterlot; even though she is ready to rule Equestria, Twilight is reluctant to leave Ponyville behind, fearing that she and her friends will drift apart in spite of their promise to rule together. Spike suggests that Twilight talk to her friends about it.\nHowever, the rest of Twilight's friends are more welcoming of this transition, explaining that change is natural and should be embraced. Applejack and Pinkie Pie are making final preparations for the ceremony; Fluttershy is rehearsing with her animal friends; Rainbow Dash is overseeing a special Wonderbolts routine; and Rarity is using star spiders to weave Twilight's coronation gown. Back at the castle, Twilight feels her friends care more about making her coronation perfect than the fact that she is leaving Ponyville.\n When Twilight's friends arrive to see her off, Twilight fully voices her frustrations. Her friends reveal that they do share her concerns and have been keeping themselves busy with the coronation so that they do not worry her or make themselves sad.

However, the ceremony hits a number of snags: Twilight briefly trips on her gown; Fluttershy's animal friends fight with Rarity's star spiders; the fireworks disrupt the Wonderbolts' aerial routine; and the coronation guests are served applesauce instead of apple cider.\n Luster Dawn believes the disastrous coronation led to Twilight and her friends drifting apart, but she is immediately proven wrong when the rest of the Mane Six enter. In the time since the coronation, the ponies have grown up, some of them getting married and starting families, but they still get together once every moon to keep in touch and rule Equestria together as the \"Council of Friendship\". The story flashes back to just after the coronation ceremony ends. Despite how disastrous it was, the ponies share a laugh about it. Starlight Glimmer and Spike arrive with a going-away present for Twilight: a book of memories for whenever she misses her friends or Ponyville. Wanting to maintain relationships with her friends for years to come, Twilight establishes the Council of Friendship. With Twilight's transition to ruler of Equestria now complete, Celestia and Luna take their leave to enjoy their retirement in Silver Shoals.\nTwilight finishes telling her story to Luster Dawn, explaining that friendships can be hard and take work to maintain, but life is even harder without them. Luster takes Twilight's lesson to heart and realizes that friendship is not a waste of time like she originally thought, but she is unsure where to start making friends. Just like Celestia did for Twilight years before, Twilight sends Luster Dawn to Ponyville.\n In this future Ponyville, the Mane Six sing The Magic of Friendship Grows, and Luster Dawn immediately starts making friends with the ponies in town. Various characters introduced throughout the series are shown to have grown up with new careers, new or bigger families, and new and fulfilling lives. Toward the end of the song, Twilight and her friends see Luster off as she goes to hang out with the friends she has made, and the storybook that opened in the series' first episode finally closes.\n"}]}]
