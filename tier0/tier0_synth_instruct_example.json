While reluctantly meeting five ponies - Applejack (a country pony), Rainbow Dash (tomboyish pegasus who controls weather), Rarity (glamorous unicorn fashion designer), Fluttershy (shy animal communicator) and Pinkie Pie (hyperactive party-loving earth pony), Nightmare Moon appears at the celebration and declares eternal nightfall. Twilight must find a way to stop her with help from her newfound friends using the Elements of Harmony, but first she has to overcome her own fears and make connections with them in order to save their world.",
